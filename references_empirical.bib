  Abstract = {The Korean population in the US increased by a third between 2000 and 2010. Korean women in the US report low calcium intake and relatively high rate of fractures. However, little is known about the prevalence of osteoporosis among Korean American women. This paper examined the relationship between prevalence of osteoporosis and milk consumption, and their relationship with acculturation among a representative sample of immigrant California women of Korean descent. Bilingual telephone surveys were conducted from a probability sample (N = 590) in 2007. Lower acculturation significantly related to lower milk consumption for women during the age periods of 12–18 and 19–34 years. Acculturation was related to higher prevalence of osteoporosis among postmenopausal, but not pre-menopausal Korean women in California. Future research should include larger cohorts, objective measures of osteoporosis, other sources of calcium specific to Korean cuisine, and assessment of bone-loading physical activity.

  Abstract = {Previous studies on the relationship between acculturation/enculturation and mental health exclusively focused on direct linear relationships between the two, sometimes yielding contradictory and inconsistent findings. More sophisticated and comprehensive research designs have been sought to illuminate the complexity of the relationship. In response, the present study attempted to examine the relationship between acculturation/enculturation and subjective well-being (SWB) by including social connectedness and its importance as a mediator and a moderator, respectively. One hundred eighty-eight Korean immigrants residing in two Midwestern metropolitan areas participated in this study. A survey questionnaire method was used for data collection. Structural equation modeling and hierarchical multiple regression analysis were used for mediation and moderation tests, respectively. The influence of acculturation was found to be partially mediated to SWB via social connectedness both in mainstream society and in the ethnic community. The influence of enculturation was found to be fully mediated to SWB via social connectedness in the ethnic community. In support of SWB theories of goal approaches and value-as-a moderator model, importance of social connectedness in mainstream society was found to moderate the relationship between social connectedness in mainstream society and positive affect. Importance of social connectedness in the ethnic community also was found to moderate the relationship between social connectedness in the ethnic community and positive affect. Theoretical, research, and clinical implications and limitations of this study were discussed and suggestions for future direction of research were made.

The purpose of the present study was to expand research investigating associations between physical activity (PA) and acculturation and their relationship with several socio-demographic factors among Turkish migrants in Germany and England. The sample consisted of 521 Turkish migrants. Migrant generation, length of residence, and language proficiency were used as indicators of acculturation. Acculturation was not associated with PA among migrants in Germany and England. PA of migrants was significantly associated with migrant's host country, age, sex, marital status, and education. The total PA of migrants in Germany was higher than that of migrants in England; the large majority of females in both Germany and England had low PA, whereas most males had moderate PA. Seemingly, PA in Turkish migrant populations will not necessarily increase as a result of greater acculturation to the host society. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

Fourteen in‐depth qualitative interviews and 3 focus groups were also conducted. Results indicated that discrimination was common and associated with worse mental health. For girls, greater Somali acculturation was associated with better mental health. Also, the association between discrimination and PTSD was less strong for girls who showed higher levels of Somali acculturation. For boys, greater American acculturation was associated with better mental health, and the association between discrimination and depression was less strong for boys with higher levels of American acculturation.

  Abstract = {Introduction: Depression is prevalent among U.S. immigrants, including Korean immigrants. However, little is known about factors that may contribute to their depression. Preliminary evidence suggests that less acculturated individuals are at greater risk for depression but that social support may buffer any negative effects of less acculturation. The aims of this study were to examine the relationship between acculturation and depressive symptoms among Korean immigrants and the moderating role of social support. Methods: A convenience sample of 132 adult Korean immigrants completed 6 self-report measures: the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, a Korean version of the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans-II, the Multi-Dimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, the Perceived Stress Scale, the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status, and a demographic questionnaire. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to examine the aims, controlling for covariates. Results: 31\% of the sample met the criteria for being depressed. Greater acculturation was associated with more depressive symptoms while greater social support was a significant predictor of fewer symptoms. Social support was more strongly related to less depression among immigrants who were less acculturated than among immigrants who were more acculturated, but this difference was not significant. Perceived stress was the most significant predictor of depression. Older age at immigration and less education were also related to greater depression. Variables in the regression model accounted for 65\% of the variance in predicting depression. Conclusions: Findings indicate a high prevalence of depressive symptoms in this Korean immigrant sample. Results also suggest that acculturation per se may not play a major role in depressive symptoms but rather more specific factors associated with acculturation such as age at immigration and educational levels. These factors should be studied in future research, along with efforts to better understand the causes of stress and impaired social networks in this population. Findings point to a need for regular assessment of depression by health care providers as well as the stress and social support available in a Korean immigrant's life. Results also suggest that community-based prevention programs to address these problems may be warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)}

Pre‐migration data (N = 225) were collected at the Finnish language courses that were part of the immigration training program. The three post‐migration follow‐ups were conducted half a year (N = 155), and 2 (N = 133) and 3 years (N = 85) after migration. Well‐being was assessed with measures of Life Satisfaction and Self‐Esteem. Life Satisfaction increased from pre‐migration to the first post‐migration measurement point, after which it stabilized. Self‐Esteem decreased throughout the study. Variables reflecting adjustment to the event of migration (e.g., acculturation stress, socio‐cultural adaptation) were primarily associated with well‐being at the first post‐migration measurement point. More general determinants of well‐being (e.g., social support and subjective economic situation) were more consistently associated with well‐being throughout the study. The results suggest that migration can be beneficial to some but detrimental to other types of well‐being. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

Using a community-based participatory research approach, we designed, administered, and analyzed a cross-sectional survey of 705 Asians (292 Chinese, 226 Korean, 187 Vietnamese) in the Portland, Oregon region to describe associations between general health status and several sociodemographic and health-related factors in pooled and ethnic-group-stratified samples. Ethnic variation existed in all covariate distributions, except employment, public-service use, language use, health status, visiting healthcare providers, sleep habits, and use of prayer, meditation, yoga or acupuncture. Acculturation measures were strong predictors of poor/fair health in logistic regression models regardless of ethnicity. Ethnic variation in outcome status existed for all remaining covariates. Most health-related research overlooks the heterogeneity within the Asian population. These findings highlight substantial variability in the associations between self-reported general health status and sociodemographic and health-related measures between Asian ethnic groups.

Data from the first nationally representative psychiatric survey of immigrant Asians in the US is used (N = 1,583). These data demonstrate the importance of understanding acculturation domains (e.g., individual differences in English proficiency, ethnic identity, and time in the US), within the social contexts of family, community, and neighborhood. Results demonstrate that among immigrant Asian women, the association between family conflict and mental health problems is stronger for those with higher ethnic identity; among immigrant Asian men, community reception (e.g., everyday discrimination) was more highly associated with increases in mental health symptoms among those with poor English fluency. Findings suggest that both individual domains of acculturation and social context measures contribute to immigrant mental health, and that it is important to consider these relationships within the context of gender.

A sample of 43 migrant and 41 Swiss pregnant women were recruited during the third trimester of pregnancy. AA was assessed by using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, and AD by using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Acculturation was assessed as a bidimensional process comprising attachment to the heritage culture and adaptation to the local Swiss culture, using the Vancouver Index of Acculturation. AA in migrant women was mainly predicted by psychosocial factors, namely socioeconomic status, marital support, family presence in Geneva and parity, while AD was predicted by one dimension of acculturation, i.e., attachment to the heritage culture. Our study can inform perinatal health care professionals about some specific risk factors for antenatal distress in migrant women in order to increase systematic screening procedures.

Use of ambulatory care among KAs was low (2.80 visits during prior 12 months), compared to their counterparts in South Korea and the U.S. population. Variables associated with higher utilization included old age, health needs, and health insurance. Income had a positive effect on health care utilization decisions among the uninsured. Acculturation appeared to be neither a strong nor consistent predictor of ambulatory care utilization among KAs. Of particular concern is the finding that KAs suffer from inadequate access to care due to lack of employment-based health insurance. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)}

Methods: We used logistic regression models to examine ethnic variations in allostatic load scores among non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, and people of Mexican origin. We also examined associations between measures of acculturation and allostatic load scores among people of Mexican origin only. Results: Foreign-born Mexicans were the least likely group to score in the higher allostatic load categories. Among individuals of Mexican origin, US-born Mexican Americans had higher allostatic load scores than foreign-born Mexicans, and acculturation measures did not account for the difference. Conclusions: Our findings expand on recent research from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey with respect to ethnicity and allostatic load. Our results are consistent with the healthy immigrant hypothesis (i.e., newer immigrants are healthier) and the acculturation hypothesis, according to which the longer Mexican immigrants reside in the United States, the greater their likelihood of potentially losing culture-related health-protective effects.

Further, the influence of immigrant status, Anglo orientation, Latino orientation, and the interaction of immigrant status and acculturation variables on IPV were examined. Data came from the Sexual Assault Among Latinas (SALAS) study that gathered data from a national sample of Latino women (N = 2,000) via telephone interviews. Results showed 15.6 \% of Latino women experienced IPV in their lifetime and threat IPV was the most common form of IPV. Physical, sexual, stalking and threat IPV were all used as abusive tactics in various configurations. Logistic regression analyses showed immigrants were less likely than U.S. born Latino women to experience any IPV and physical IPV. Anglo orientation was associated with increased odds of any IPV and stalking IPV while Latino orientation was associated with decreased odds of all forms of IPV. Furthermore, the protective effect of Latino orientation for stalking IPV was pronounced among immigrants. Together the results show that 1 in 6 Latino women experience IPV and that sociocultural factors such as immigrant status and acculturation are important considerations for this group, underscoring the influence of migration and cultural adaptation to family functioning.

  Abstract = {Migration is a normal process of people seeking new opportunities, work, or leisure in societies. The way people adapt to a new country (acculturation) is a complex process in which immigrants’ evaluations about the culture of origin and their perceptions of the host country interact. The combination of these two factors produces four types of acculturation: separation, assimilation, integration, and marginalization. Several variables, such as personality, attitudes, and emotional intelligence, have been studied to help explain this process. However, the impact of a culture of honor and its interaction with other variables remains an open question that may help to explain how migrants can better adjust to their host culture. In this study, we examine the influence of the culture of honor (social) and emotional intelligence (individual) on acculturation. In a sample of 129 Moroccan women (mean age = 29, SD = 9.40) immigrants in Spain (mean time in Spain = 6 years, SD = 3.60), we investigated the relations among the variables of interest. Our results show that no significant differences emerged in the scores given for culture of honor (CH) and the acculturation strategies of the Moroccan immigrant women F(3, 99) = .233; p = .87. However women who preferred the integration strategy scored highest on emotional intelligence (EI), whereas the assimilated immigrants showed the lowest scores for EI F(3, 92) = 4.63; p = .005. Additionally, only in the case of integration does EI mediate between CH and the value given to the immigrant’s own and host cultures (p {\textless}.001).

  Abstract = {Objective: Physical symptoms are common and a leading reason for primary care visits; however, data are lacking on their prevalence among racial/ethnic minorities in the United States. This study aimed to compare the prevalence of physical symptoms among White, Latino and Asian Americans, and examine the association of symptoms and acculturation. Methods: We analyzed data from the National Latino and Asian American Study, a nationally representative survey of 4864 White, Latino and Asian American adults. We compared the age- and gender-adjusted prevalence of 14 physical symptoms among the racial/ethnic groups and estimated the association between indicators of acculturation (English proficiency, nativity, generational status and proportion of lifetime in the United States) and symptoms among Latino and Asian Americans. Results: After adjusting for age and gender, the mean number of symptoms was similar for Whites (1.00) and Latinos (0.95) but significantly lower among Asian Americans (0.60, P {\textless} .01 versus Whites). Similar percentages of Whites (15.4\%) and Latinos (13.0\%) reported three or more symptoms, whereas significantly fewer Asian Americans (7.7\%, P {\textless} .05 versus Whites) did. In models adjusted for sociodemographic variables and clinical status (psychological distress, medical conditions and disability), acculturation was significantly associated with physical symptoms among both Latino and Asian Americans, such that the most acculturated individuals had the most physical symptoms. Conclusions: The prevalence of physical symptoms differs across racial/ethnic groups, with Asian Americans reporting fewer symptoms than Whites. Consistent with a 'healthy immigrant' effect, increased acculturation was strongly associated with greater symptom burden among both Latino and Asian Americans.

  Abstract = {In this study we tested an integrated model of the relationship between immigrants' linguistic acculturation, socioeconomic status (SES), perceived discrimination, social support networks, general health status, and psychological well-being. A nationwide adult probability sample (N = 2360) included Finnish repatriates and Russian and Estonian immigrants from the former Soviet Union, Russia, and Estonia. In the total sample, linguistic acculturation was directly and negatively related to psychological well-being. Increased acculturation also influenced well-being indirectly through an increase in perceived discrimination. Although acculturation also increased the use of ethnic and host support networks, the effect of these social support networks on well-being depended on the stress level. Particularly, the direct effect of acculturation on well-being disappeared and was instead mediated by social support networks when examining the more vulnerable subsamples of the study, i.e., women and those who perceived substantial discrimination. Higher levels of SES were linked to better well-being through increased health status. It was concluded that the acculturation process plays a dual role in psychological functioning and that it is important to ensure more directly not only immigrants' cultural but also their socioeconomic integration.

Although the initial hypothesized model was not confirmed, a modified model with good fit indices showed that acculturation orientation mediated the relationships of perceived discrimination and acculturative stress with psychological distress. Of all the factors in the model, acculturative stress had the strongest association with psychological distress. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)}

Data from the 2007 New Mexico Youth Risk and Resiliency Surveys were analyzed. Adjusted logistic regression analyses were conducted among the full sample of Hispanic females (N = 3,412) and among strata based on immigration status. Immigrant Hispanic girls were as likely as non-immigrant Hispanic girls to have experienced dating violence in the prior year (P = 0.93). Among immigrant Hispanic girls, those who were Non-English-dominant were one-fourth as likely to have experienced dating violence as those immigrant girls who were English-dominant (aOR 0.27 [95\% CI 0.08-0.87]). Among US-born Hispanic girls, those who were Non-English-dominant were less likely to have experienced dating violence; however, this value did not reach statistical significance (aOR 0.65 [95\% CI 0.33-1.27]). Past sexual experience was a significant risk factor for dating violence for US-born Hispanic girls (aOR 4.99 [95\% CI 3.18-7.83]) but not for immigrant Hispanic girls (aOR 1.66 [95\% CI 0.63-4.43]). Immigrant status was not found to be protective against dating violence for New Mexico Hispanic girls. However, those immigrant girls who were less acculturated in terms of language used at home were found to have only a quarter of the risk of dating violence as those more acculturated. The use of heritage language by immigrant Hispanic girls may be a protective factor against dating violence. Further studies are indicated to confirm this finding.

The goals of this research study were to see how acculturation, acculturative stress, and religiosity were associated with psychological adjustment among Muslim Arab American adolescents. One hundred twenty-eight Arab American adolescents (ages 11–21) completed measures of demographic characteristics, acculturation, acculturative stress, religiosity, and social desirability. Age, gender, religiosity, and length of time in the U.S. were found to significantly predict heritage cultural orientation but not mainstream cultural orientation. Moreover, acculturation and acculturative stress significantly predicted psychological problems but not overall competence. The implications of the study address how practitioners may consider religion, acculturation, and related stressors when working with Muslim Arab American adolescents.

Additionally, we studied the mediating role of affiliation with cannabis-using peers. Method: Data were utilized from i4culture, a Dutch study on immigrant adolescents and young adults aged 15–24 years. Participants belonged to the five largest immigrant populations in the Netherlands, living in or around the four major Dutch cities: Amsterdam, the Hague, Rotterdam, and Utrecht. In total, 771 adolescents and young adults (mean age 19.29, SD = 2.61, 53.8\% female) from Surinamese (n = 210, 27.2\%), Moroccan (n = 209, 27.1\%), Turkish (n = 110, 14.3\%), Antillean (n = 109, 14.1\%), and Asian (n = 133, 17.3\%) backgrounds participated. With questionnaires, past year cannabis use, acculturation strategy, linguistic acculturation, and affiliation with cannabis-using peers were assessed. Results: Using logistic regression analyses, we found no relation between acculturation strategy and past year cannabis use (OR = 1.25, p = 0.38 for separation vs integration and OR = 0.86, p = 0.50 for marginalization vs integration). Linguistic acculturation was positively related to cannabis use (OR = 2.20, p {\textless} 0.01). Affiliation with cannabis-using peers partly mediated this relation (OR = 1.09, p {\textless} 0.01). Conclusions: Non-Western immigrant youngsters who speak the host culture’s language at home are more likely to use cannabis than youngsters who speak their native language at home. The former group is more likely to affiliate with cannabis-using peers, which partly explains their increased risk of cannabis use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)}

Results showed the expected gap: immigrant and immigrant descendant children revealed lower school achievement than their native peers; but only immigrant, and not immigrant descendant children, reported lower levels of well-being and peer acceptance. Perceived discrimination was negatively related to school achievement, via an increased desire for culture maintenance, only among immigrant children. The indirect effects of perceived discrimination on well-being and peer acceptance were not significant. However, perceived discrimination was strongly related to lower well-being and acceptance, independently of the target group, suggesting that its negative association with well-being in the school context might encompass a more general process affecting both immigrant and immigrant descendant children.

This study was based on a national random sample of 1,500 Asian Indians in the United States. Ninety-one participants replied to the survey by mail. This research used correlational and explanatory, nonexperimental designs. A demographic questionnaire was used to ensure that participants met the criteria for the study and provided descriptive information for the sample. Acculturation was measured using the Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identity Acculturation Scale (SL-ASIA). Personality was measured using the Personal Preferences Self-Description Questionnaire (PPSDQ). The results of multiple regression and factorial multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) yielded statistical non-significant relationships between acculturation and personality subscales. Acculturation scores were consistent with the sample's composition and represented a complete range of acculturation levels. A majority of the study's participants were first-generation immigrants. Twice as many males comprised the sample as females. Personality scores were restricted in range with an overrepresentation of Intuitive and Judging Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) types. Possible reasons for the study's results are discussed. Implications for the counseling profession are included along with recommendations for future research.

After adjustment for potential confounders, current smoking prevalence was higher and the quit rate was lower for Korean, Filipino, and Vietnamese American men compared with Chinese American men. Women's current smoking prevalence was lower than men's in all six Asian American subgroups. South Asian and Korean American women reported lower quit rates than women from other ethnic subgroups. Asian American men who reported using only English at home had lower current smoking prevalence and higher quit rates, except for Filipino and South Asian American men. Asian American women who reported using only English at home had higher current smoking prevalence except for Japanese women. Being a second or later generation immigrant was associated with lower smoking prevalence among all Asian American subgroups of men. Less educated men and women had higher smoking prevalence and lower quit rates. In conclusion, both current smoking prevalence and quit rates vary distinctively across gender and ethnic subgroups among Asian Americans in California. Acculturation appears to increase the risk of cigarette smoking for Asian American women. Future tobacco-control programs should target at high-risk Asian American subgroups, defined by ethnicity, acculturation status, and gender.

The main findings from this study indicate: (1) patterns of cultural adjustment differ for children and adolescents according to cultural background, gender, age, and length of stay in the host culture; (2)former-Yugoslavian migrants generally report greater identification and involvement with Australian cultural norms than Chinese migrant youth; and (3) the divergent variables social support and bicultural adjustment are not universally paired with acculturative stress, as previously indicated in other adult migrant and acculturation studies.

  Abstract = {This article proposes to characterize the situation of Afro-Colombian immigrant families, with emphasis on women living in the Region of Antofagasta, Chile. A mixed methodology was used, with interviews, conversation groups, and surveys of groups of men and women born in Colombia who have settled in Chile. It was sought to describe their experiences in two contexts: the first, from outside in, as a context of emigration from Colombia, and the second, the current context of immigration in Chile. The principal findings include a description of what the displacement means for the women based on their motivations to migrate and the relevant experiences they had in accessing Chilean territory and in the normalization of their migratory status. Transversally, the authors observed whether or not their basic, social, and economic rights were prevalent and the constant impact that the contextual and ethnic systems that affect them had on the immigrant women.

  Abstract = {The concept of acculturation has been used to understand differences in health behaviors between and within a variety of racial and ethnic immigrant groups. Few studies, however, have examined the potential impact of acculturation on health behaviors among African Americans. The present study has two goals: 1) to reconfirm relations between acculturation and cigarette smoking; 2) to investigate the impact of acculturation on another type of health behavior, cancer screening and specifically breast self-examination (BSE). African American women (N = 66) attending an inner-city cancer-screening clinic completed study questionnaires. Results reconfirmed psychometric properties of the African American Acculturation Scale (AAAS); replicated the negative association between acculturation and lifetime smoking status; and found relations between acculturation and women's adherence to BSE frequency guidelines. Findings from this study raise the possibility that specific aspects of acculturation may better explain specific health behaviors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

  Abstract = {Background: Acculturation is associated with an elevated risk of obesity among older Latinos, but the relationship between acculturation and body mass among childbearing Latina women has not been adequately studied. Methods: We analyzed data from 313 pregnant Latina women at San Francisco General Hospital. The dependent variable was prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), categorized as underweight ({\textless}18.5), normal (18.5-24.9, reference), overweight (25-29.9), or obese (≥30). The independent variables were acculturation metrics, measured by acculturation index score, degree of Americanization, national origin subgroup, and the number of years residing in the United States. Results: One third of women were overweight, and one fifth were obese. Education (OR 0.88, 95\% CI 0.81-0.96) was inversely associated with overweight, after adjusting for confounding variables. Longer residence in the United States (OR 1.08 for each additional year residing in the United States, 95\% CI 1.02-1.15), older age (OR 1.08, 95\% CI 1.01-1.16), and higher gravidity, the total number of pregnancies (OR 1.41, 95\% CI 1.09-1.84), were significantly associated with obesity. Conclusions: One measure of acculturation, length of time residing in the United States, was associated with obesity among childbearing Latina women. Efforts to reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity in Latina women should not target recent immigrants but instead focus on long-term immigrants as well as women who are older and have low educational attainment and high gravidity.

  Abstract = {The current paper explores the salience and impact of ethnic and national identities for immigrants that are negotiating more than two cultures. Specifically, we were interested in the ways in which Jewish immigrant adolescents from the former Soviet Union integrate their Russian, Jewish, and American identities, and to what extent identification with these three cultures predicts adaptation to varied life domains. In order to examine whether being Jewish has an impact on salience and predictive value of Russian and American identities, a sample of Jewish adolescents (n = 100) was compared with a sample of non-Jewish (n = 113) adolescent immigrants from the former Soviet Union. The study suggests that Jewish and non-Jewish adolescent immigrants differ in levels of Russian and American identity. Further, using structural equation modeling a bicultural model for Jewish and non-Jewish adolescents was tested. The results suggest that these two groups do not differ with respect to how Russian and American identities impact on adjustment. However, adding Jewish identity to the model for the Jewish sample significantly improved model fit, and rendered some of the impact of Russian identity non-significant. Thus a multicultural model that included all three identities had better explanatory power for this sample than a bicultural one. Implications for the study of ethnic identity of immigrants, particularly those whose lives involve multiple cultural affiliations, are drawn.

Longitudinal multilevel analyses based on 386 early adolescent immigrant students (Mage = 10.49 years) in 44 ethnically heterogeneous classrooms in Germany revealed that the manifestations of both types of policies promote psychological school adjustment (i.e., better well‐being and fewer psychological and behavioral problems) at the individual level. However, they differ in their effects on acculturation orientations. At the classroom level, equality and inclusion promote assimilation.

Filipino males who were Americans by birth/naturalization had higher odds of blindness/deafness (OR 2.94; 95 \% CI = 1.69, 5.12) than non-citizens. Males who spoke English at home had higher odds of blindness/deafness (OR 1.82; 95 \% CI = 1.05, 3.17) and memory/learning problems (OR 2.28; 95 \% CI = 1.25, 4.15), while females had higher odds of memory/learning problems (OR 1.75; 95 \% CI = 1.13, 2.73). Acculturation is associated with greater odds of disabilities for Filipino men. Males may be more sensitive to acculturation-effects than females due to culturally prescribed roles and gender-specific experiences at the time of immigration.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Texas City Stress and Health Study conducted in Texas City, Texas during 2004–2006. Participants: A total of 1435 Mexican-Americans aged 25 years and older. Measures: Binge drinking (≥6 drinks per occasion by men and ≥4 drinks per occasion by women) and scoring positive on the CAGE (a four-item clinical measure of problem drinking) as dependent variables. Key independent variables included a measure of language acculturation, proportion of Hispanics in the participant's neighborhood according to 2000 U.S. Census data, and being foreign-born compared with being U.S.-born. Analysis: Logistic regression analysis was used to predict being a binge drinker and being positive on the CAGE. Results: Foreign-born women were less likely to be binge drinkers than U.S.-born women. Nativity was not significant among men. Moreover women were less likely to be binge drinkers if they lived in heavily Hispanic neighborhoods. No such effect was found among men. Similar results were obtained with the CAGE. Conclusions: We found a powerful influence of nativity (being U.S.-born compared with foreign born) and neighborhood Hispanic concentration on problem drinking among women but not among men. It is likely that cultural norms in heavily Hispanic environments discourage problem drinking among women but not among men. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

  Abstract = {Tobacco use is prevalent in the Middle East, and relatively, high rates of smoking behaviors are reported in the immigrant populations from this region. This study examined tobacco use in association with health beliefs and acculturation status among a convenience sample (N=132) of Arab-Americans over age 18 residing in California. A cross-sectional descriptive correlational design was employed and data collection included the following instruments: the Health Belief Questionnaire; Acculturating Rating Scale for Arab-American-II; Tobacco Use Questionnaire; plus a brief demographic survey. An integrative model of the Health Belief Model and Berry's Acculturation Model guided this study. Results showed that despite the increase in subjects' general health concern, tobacco use was still high. Subjects reported that barriers surrounding tobacco cessation were greater than the benefits of quitting, and those with lower levels of acculturation had higher levels of tobacco use regardless of duration of residency. The data supported the hypothesis that culture plays an important role in smoking behavior and health motivation. The Arab culture emphasizes both fatalism and reliance on God's will, but disease prevention programs in the US emphasize the individual's role in health promotion. Thus, culturally-sensitive tobacco cessation programs should be tailored to meet the needs of this high risk population. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

Methods: Data come from EAT 2010, a population-based study of weight and related behaviors (N = 1577, mean age = 14.5 years). Adjusted models tested associations between weight-based teasing and well-being, controlling for BMI and ethnic group; effect modification by ethnic group and acculturation were also explored. Results: Family weight-based teasing was common (12.1\%–42.9\% reporting this experience across gender and ethnic groups) and was associated with all four measures of well-being in the expected direction. Associations were statistically equivalent in all ethnic groups and were not modified by acculturation. Conclusion: Youth from immigrant communities experience family weight-based teasing and associated threats to well-being. Additional research is needed to further understand the cultural context of weight-based teasing and develop relevant prevention messages.

HEPESE is a longitudinal cohort study of 3,050 non-institutionalized Mexican Americans aged 65 years at baseline (1993–1994) from 5 Southwestern states. Diabetes incidence was ascertained in 4 follow-up surveys to 2004–05 by respondent self-reported physician-diagnosis of diabetes, high blood glucose, or sugar in the urine. Language of interview, immigrant generation, gender, age, education, family history of diabetes, smoking status, alcohol use, health insurance type and self-reported height and weight were assessed. High socioeconomic status (SES) was defined by high school graduation and non-Medicaid insurance. Cox’s proportional hazards models were fit to evaluate the effects of language acculturation, generation and SES on incident diabetes. 845 of 3,050 (27.7 \%) Mexican Americans had diabetes at baseline and were younger, more educated, and more likely to have health insurance than those without diabetes. Risk of developing diabetes increased for Spanish-speaking respondents with low SES from 1st to 3rd generation (HR = 1.76, 95 \% CI = 1.02–3.03) and from 2nd to 3rd generation (HR = 2.15, 95 \% CI = 1.20–3.84). Among English-speaking, high SES participants, generation had a protective effect on developing diabetes: HR = 0.45 (95 \% CI = 0.22–0.91) when comparing 3rd versus 1st generation. The effect of language acculturation and immigrant generation on incident diabetes is moderated by SES status in HEPESE participants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

The purpose of this study was to examine relationships between acculturation and features of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in Mexican and Mexican–American women (n = 60) living in the largest US-Mexico border community. Acculturation was measured by the short acculturation scale for Hispanics and birthplace. Body composition was measured by Bod Pod and daily physical activity was measured by questionnaire and accelerometer. Increased acculturation was related to individual features of MetS and increased risk of MetS. These relationships were mediated by fat mass rather than inactivity. Fat mass mediates the relationships between acculturation and individual features of MetS in young Mexican and Mexican–American women. These findings suggest that fat mass, rather than inactivity, is an important contributor to disease risk in young Mexican and Mexican–American women living in a large US/Mexico border community.

  Abstract = {This paper explores the working hours-happiness relationship of Latinos living in the United States and compares it with that of the host society. We find that immigrant Latinos have adopted American work-happiness relationships while having lower levels of subjective well-being. Acculturation plays an important role not only with respect to work attitudes, but also to social status, and it is the latter that affects the well-being of Latinos of color. Future quality-of-life research needs to analyze whether the dichotomy between work attitude and social status will persist or whether this vibrant and increasing group of immigrants who are so vital to the U.S. economy will both adapt to host society values and begin to introduce positive change in those values in a society where multiculturalism is on the rise.

Measures: The outcome measures included both self-reported PA and device-assessed PA. The acculturation measure was constructed based on nativity, language use at home, and length of residence in the United States. Analysis: Regressions with domain analysis were conducted to adjust for the influence of confounding factors and complex survey design. Results: For men, self-reported PA increased with acculturation, especially leisure-time PA. However, device-assessed PA decreased with acculturation. For women, the results were more mixed.

Youth differed in their exposure to stressors and how they responded to them. Cambodian and Laotian youth reported the highest levels of stressors, except for emotional abuse. Only physical abuse was an independent predictor of serious violence for all groups, except Chinese. Perceived social support buffered the effects of some stressors, whereas increased levels of acculturation, intergenerational/intercultural conflict, and individualism placed youth at increased risk for serious violence. The results suggest that the moderating effects of culture and social support need to be considered when examining the association between life stressors and serious violence for Chinese and Southeast Asian youth.

The sample included 165 FSU-Pontian immigrants, 272 immigrants from Albania, and their 525 Greek classmates (mean age = 13.7 years). School adjustment data were obtained using multiple methods and informants. Students also reported their subjective well-being and acculturation via multiple measures. Findings indicated that FSU-Pontian adolescents, although they are Greek citizens, had a stronger ethnic and a lower host-national orientation than did Albanian students. Both immigrant groups experienced similar difficulties in school adjustment. Involvement in Greek culture was a salient predictor of school adjustment, while involvement in one's ethnic culture was related to subjective well-being. Findings suggest that the acculturation expectations of host country members may be related to immigrants' acculturation orientations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)}

  Abstract = {This study examines the relationship between social capital and acculturative stress in a sample of the Canadian Iraqi-Christian community based on age, income, education, and gender. The dependent variable in this study was acculturative stress while the independent variables included measures of social capital described as constructs based on factor analysis and demographic variables. Five hypotheses were generated, and data was collected from 326 Iraqi Christians residing in Southern Ontario, Canada, who completed a set of questionnaires administrated by the researcher of this study. Three layers of analysis were implemented to test each hypothesis. The first layer tested the predictability of social-capital constructs and the demographic variables on the overall acculturative-stress score. Using logistic regression, an 'Acculturative Stress Main Model' was developed to test the predictability of the social-capital constructs and demographic variables on the overall acculturative-stress score. A binary score was created by splitting the sum of responses to all acculturative stress at the median score. The range of the acculturative-stress sum score was 1 to 100 with a median score of39. This means participants showed a moderate level of acculturative stress. The second layer of the analysis investigated the specific interrelationships between the independent variables and each individual construct of the acculturative stress instrument. This layer of the analysis provided a better understanding of the complex relationships between the dependent and independent variables. For this purpose, six logistic regression models were developed: (1) AS experiencing stereotypes, (2) AS change in values, (3) AS language competencies, (4) AS feeling unappreciated , (5) AS experiencing discrimination, (6) AS identification with country of origin. Each model tested an individual construct of acculturative stress as a dependent variable and against the independent variables of the study (age, education, gender, income, and the six social-capital constructs). A binary score was computed for each acculturative-stress construct, and the distribution was split at the median within each construct. The third layer evaluated each factor from the social-capital instrument and the demographic variables as predictors on the binary outcome for the individual construct of acculturative stress by splitting the sample according to gender to understand the source of stress for each gender. The results of this study in relation to the first, second, fourth, and, fifth hypotheses were consistent with existing social-capital literature on health, which considers social capital as resources that reduce psychological stressors and improve the health and well-being of individuals. In effect, because the participants of this study enjoy social capital, they do not experience high level of acculturative stress. The moderate level of acculturative stress they do experience is due to their interaction with people from the dominant culture. However, the results of this study in relation to the third hypothesis were inconsistent with previous literature. This is one of the few studies that introduces the concept of social capital to the field of social work, considering social capital as a source of social integration and as means of economic success. Social capital is also essential for policy development to support diversity inclusion and social cohesion in a multicultural society. This study connects the concept of social capital to the psychological health of immigrants by considering social capital as a predictive factor of acculturative stress. This investigation developed its acculturation model as involving three levels of interaction by the immigrant. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

These men were primarily Mexican, of low SES background, low in acculturation to the United States, and their income ranged from \$100 and \$400 a week, 40\% of which is sent back home. The psychosocial context of HIV risk included concerns expressed about lack of money and employment, followed by racism, social isolation, sadness and loneliness. High rates of alcohol use and binge drinking that co-occur with sexual activities were reported. While only 7\% of MDLs reported illegal injection drug use, needles were frequently shared without bleach cleaning. Men generally did not carry condoms and knowledge of proper condom use was poor. For the most common form of sex reported, vaginal sex, condom use was infrequent. However, men did report confidence in being able to insist on condom use in challenging sexual situations, and they also reported fairly frequent pro-condom attitudes and behaviors within their social circles. Slightly over half of the men reported sexual activity with female partners, during the past 2 months. These female partners were almost evenly divided into regular sex partners, including spouses, and riskier partners such as one time only sex partners, prostitutes, and multiple sex partners. Results also indicated encouraging efforts by MDLs to reduce risk with risky partners (e.g., more condom use). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

While immigrant adolescents are faced with the realities of 2 different cultures, they also have to master age-salient tasks, such as self-efficacy and identity development. To get a better insight into the interplay of developmental and acculturative tasks and their relationship with family functioning, we used 3-wave longitudinal data over a 2-year period from 13-year-old immigrant students (N = 609) in Athens, Greece. Cross-lagged models revealed that family functioning and acculturation were resources for the mastery of developmental tasks. Involvement in the host culture prospectively predicted self-efficacy beliefs, and involvement in the ethnic culture prospectively predicted ethnic identity. These effects increased over time. Family functioning prospectively predicted self-efficacy and ethnic identity. These effects decreased over time. The findings suggest that a well-functioning family, for early adolescents, and being involved in the host culture and in ethnic cultures, for middle adolescents, are particularly important resources to master the tasks of their developmental period. Our findings underscore the importance of developmentally sensitive approaches and the need to account for acculturative challenges in order to understand individual differences in immigrant youth adaptation.

  Abstract = {Purpose: Informal family care for elders is conventional in Mexican American communities despite increasing intergenerational gaps in filial values. In our study, we explored whether acculturation and dyadic mutuality, as perceived by Mexican American family caregivers, explain the caregivers’ expectations of family loyalty toward elderly relatives. Design: A nonexperimental, correlational design with convenience sampling was used in El Paso, Texas, from October 2007 to January 2008. Methods: Three bilingual promotoras collected data from 193 Mexican American adult caregivers of community‐dwelling elders using three scales designed for Mexican Americans: the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans II‐Short Form, the Mutuality Scale, and the Expectations of Family Loyalty of Children Toward Elderly Relatives Scale. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to analyze the data. Findings: Acculturation had a marginal effect (r = .21, p {\textless} .05), but mutuality presented a strong correlation (r = .45, p {\textless} .001) with the expectations of family loyalty toward elderly relatives. There was no significant correlation between acculturation and mutuality (r = .05). Conclusions: Although Mexican American caregivers with strong Mexican orientation may have high expectations of family loyalty toward elderly relatives, mutuality exhibits more significant effects on expectations. Among Mexican Americans, mutuality between the caregiving dyad, as perceived by caregivers, may be a better predictor of filial values than caregivers’ acculturation alone. Clinical Relevance: It may be useful to incorporate the dual paradigm of acculturation and mutuality into immigrant family care for elderly relatives.

The study compares self-reported positive mental health among 651 refugees, 309 economic immigrants, and 448 family class immigrants from 50 source countries. Immigration-related predictors of mental health were examined including sociodemographic characteristics, discrimination, acculturation variables, and experiences of reception. Separate analyses were carried out for women and men. Refugees had lower levels of positive mental health than other migrants. Affiliative feelings towards the source country jeopardized refugee, but not immigrant mental health. A sense of belonging to Canada was a significant predictor of mental health. Perceived discrimination explained refugee mental health disadvantage among men, but not women. Bridging social networks were a mental health asset, particularly for women. The implications of anti-refugee discrimination net of the effects of anti-immigrant and anti-visible minority antipathies are discussed, as well as possible reasons for gender differences in the salience of mental health predictors.

  Abstract = {Background: Turkish migrants in the Netherlands have a high prevalence of depressive and/or anxiety disorders. Acculturation has been shown to be related to higher levels of psychological distress, although it is not clear whether this also holds for depressive and anxiety disorders in Turkish migrants. This study aims to clarify the relationship between acculturation strategies (integration, assimilation, separation and marginalization) and the prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders as well as utilisation of GP care among Turkish migrants. Methods: Existing data from an epidemiological study conducted among Dutch, Turkish and Moroccan inhabitants of Amsterdam were re-examined. Four scales of acculturation strategies were created in combination with the bi-dimensional approach of acculturation by factor analysis. The Lowlands Acculturation Scale and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview were used to assess acculturation and mood and anxiety disorders. Socio-demographic variables, depressive, anxiety and co-morbidity of both disorders and the use of health care services were associated with the four acculturation strategies by means of Chi-Squared and Likelihood tests. Three two-step logistic regression analyses were performed to control for possible, confounding variables. Results: The sample consisted of 210 Turkish migrants. Significant associations were found between the acculturation strategies and age (p {\textless} .01), education (p {\textless} .01), daily occupation (p {\textless} .01) and having a long-term relationship (p = .03). A significant association was found between acculturation strategies and depressive disorders (p = .049): integration was associated with a lower risk of depression, separation with a higher risk. Using the axis separately, participation in Dutch society showed a significant relationship with a decreased risk of depressive, anxiety and co-morbidity of both disorders (OR = .15; 95\% CI: .024 - .98). Non-participation showed no significant association. No association was found between the acculturation strategies and uptake of GP care. Conclusions: Turkish migrants who integrate may have a lower risk of developing a depressive disorder. Participation in Dutch culture is associated with a decreased risk of depressive, anxiety and co-morbidity of both disorders. Further research should focus on the assessment of acculturation in the detection of depression. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)}

  Abstract = {The number of immigrant children in the US continues to grow rapidly, but pediatric immigrant health remains a poorly understood domain. Previous research suggests immigrant children have reduced risk for injury, but the reason for that finding remains unknown. One leading hypothesis is cultural—less acculturated children in the United States appear to be protected from injury—but the combined influence of immigrant status and acculturation is unclear. This study examines the roles of immigration and language acculturation on pediatric injury risk. Samples of 8,526 children and 4,010 adolescents included in the 2003 California Health Interview Survey were studied. The primary analytic technique was Poisson regressions predicting incidents of injury requiring professional medical attention. Predictor variables included demographic characteristics, health insurance availability, birthplace (US vs. other), and language acculturation. Both birthplace and language acculturation were related to children’s and to adolescent’s risk for unintentional injury, but language acculturation emerged as the stronger univariate predictor and only multivariate predictor of injury in both models. Possible interpretations of the results are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

  Abstract = {The 'Latina epidemiologic paradox' refers to the observation that despite socioeconomic disadvantages, Latina mothers in the United States (US) have a similar or lower risk for delivering an infant with low birth weight (LBW) compared to non-Latina White mothers. An analogous paradox may exist between foreign-born (FB) and US-born (USB) Latinas. Our goal was to assess differences in LBW in USB Latinas, FB Latinas, and non-Latina Whites in Los Angeles County in 2003 using birth records and survey data. Using logistic regression, we estimated associations between LBW and birthplace/ethnicity in a birth cohort and nested survey responder group and between LBW and acculturation in responders to a follow-up survey. USB Latinas and FB Latinas had a higher prevalence of LBW infants compared to Whites (odds ratio [OR] = 1.34, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = (1.17, 1.53) and OR = 1.32, 95\% CI = (1.18, 1.49), respectively); when we adjusted for additional maternal risk factors these point estimates were attenuated, and interval estimates were consistent with a modest positive or inverse association. Among Latinas only, LBW was more common for high-acculturated FB and USB Latinas compared to low-acculturated FB Latinas, and there was limited evidence that environmental or behavior risk factors had less impact in low-acculturated Latinas. In summary, adjusting only for demographics, Latinas in our study were more likely to have LBW infants compared to Whites, in contrast to the Latina paradox hypothesis. Furthermore, adjusting for environmental or behavioral factors attenuated the positive association, but there was little evidence that Latinas had a lower prevalence of LBW regardless of the variables included in the models. Finally, among Latinas, there was limited evidence that associations between known risk factors and LBW were modified by acculturation. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)}

Using the five ethno-generational categories as a grouping variable, we conducted analyses of 313 survey responses to the acculturation items at two time periods, 9 weeks apart. Results showed that differences among the three host racial/ethnic groups can best be explained by a group dominance perspective, whereby the two racial/ethnic minority groups are more similar to each other than they are to the European- American group. Furthermore, the relationship between American identity and ethnic identity components is stronger among the three host groups, as compared to the immigrant groups. Implications for future research with adolescent members of the host group whose heritage culture is non-European are drawn. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

Bowlby's grieving process was used as a theoretical framework to explore grief reactions to leaving the homeland (homesickness) resulting from exposure to a new culture. Crucial to successful settlement was the nature of strategies the women used to negotiate the grieving process. Participants who successfully settled and re-invented themselves engaged in more social, cultural and country activities - those participants who were less successful in this endeavour tended toward more solitary strategies. The study has social implications for future migrants to utilize appropriate strategies that could reduce the psychological impact of relocation.

To better understand FI among Latinos, potential risk factors beyond poverty, including acculturation indicators and smoking status, were explored. Cross-sectional data from 6,681 Latino adults from the 1999–2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys were used. Partial proportional odds (PPO) models were used to estimate associations of FI, including cigarette smoking and acculturation. The PPO models indicated that compared with never smokers, current smokers had significantly higher odds of FI (odds ratios ranged from 1.32 to 1.51 across models). Lower levels of acculturation and poverty and being a younger or middle-aged adult were also significantly associated with FI. Among Latinos, current smoking and low acculturation are important risk factors for FI. Current smoking and low acculturation may exacerbate nutritional deprivation in a population that is already disproportionally affected by poverty and poor health outcomes.

School adaptation was assessed in terms of academic (GPA), behavioral (disciplinary infractions), and attitudinal (sense of school belonging) components. Results suggested that differing patterns of overall American and Russian acculturation were associated with differing school outcomes, as were language competence, behavior, and identity with respect to the different cultures. In general, higher levels of American acculturation predicted school adaptation while aspects of Russian acculturation were differentially related to school adaptation for different subgroups. Results indicated the importance of conceptualizing acculturation as a multidimensional concept with respect to both culture or origin and culture of resettlement.

  Abstract = {The focus of this study was to examine the relationship between the acculturation processes of Armenian immigrants living in Southern California and their preferences for reward allocations, particularly in work settings representing different workgroup ethnic compositions. This project was an effort to expand our understanding of the impact of acculturation in the workplace and on workplace practices, particularly on the rapidly growing number of diversity programs. A sample of 150 Armenian immigrants (8 Assimilated, 32 Separated, and 109 Bicultural Armenians) living in the United States of America participated in this study. The participants completed a series of questionnaires including: (1) a reward allocation questionnaire which measured reward distribution preferences, (2) the Pan-Acculturation Scale (Soriano, 1999) which identified participants' acculturation type, (3) the Values Scale (Singelis et al., 1995) which assessed the participants' cultural patterns in terms of vertical and horizontal individualism and collectivism, (4) the Group Characteristics Questionnaire (Ferdman \& Horenczyk, 2000) which determined the strength of ethnic identity with respect to the Armenian and American cultures, and (5) a demographic questionnaire. The hypotheses concerning participants' choice of equity-based or equality-based allocation style varying based on acculturation type was not supported. Essentially, Assimilated, Separated, and Bicultural Armenian immigrants did not demonstrate a significant difference in preferences for reward allocations. The hypotheses concerning the interaction between type of acculturation and workgroup ethnic composition in preferences for reward allocations was also not supported in that Bicultural Armenian immigrants did not differ in their reward allocation preferences based on the workgroup ethnic composition. An unexpected finding in the data set was that Separated and Bicultural respondents preferred the Horizontal Individualism (HI) cultural pattern whereas the Assimilated respondents preferred the Horizontal Collectivism (HC) cultural pattern. The results of this empirical research show preliminary evidence of within-group differences among Armenian immigrants. The results demonstrated that the Vertical Individualism cultural value is significantly related to preferences for equity over equality (r = .31, p {\textless} .000). This is an important contribution to cross-cultural psychological literature in that it establishes a connection between cultural values and preferences in reward allocations. In addition, this finding is an important one for employers to take note of. In order to maximize motivating factors, employers must ensure that the rewards will lead to the desired results. To this end, employers must be open to researching and identifying what motivates their employees by diversifying the types of rewards and the manners in which they are distributed.

The Sexual Assault Among Latinas (SALAS) Study surveyed 2,000 adult Latino women who lived in high-density Latino neighborhoods in 2008. The present study reports findings for a subsample of women who were victimized in the United States (n = 568). Immigrant women reported significantly less victimization than U.S.-born Latino women in bivariate analyses. Multivariate models showed that Anglo orientation was associated with greater odds of all forms of victimization, whereas both Latino orientation and being an immigrant were associated with lower odds of all forms of victimization. Latino orientation was more protective for immigrant women than for U.S.-born Latino women with regard to sexual victimization. Among the victimized subsample, being an immigrant, Anglo acculturation, and masculine gender role were associated with a higher victimization count, whereas Latino orientation and religious intensity were associated with a lower victimization count. The findings point to the risk associated with being a U.S. minority, the protective value of Latino cultural maintenance, and the need for services to reach out to Anglo acculturated Latino women.

Data (n = 703) were collected among three population-based samples of working-age Vietnamese immigrants, repatriated emigrants and never-migrated Vietnamese nationals. This allows for a decomposition exercise to separate the effects of migration effects from selection effects on body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio (WHR). Immigrants are more likely to be overweight and to have high WHR, relative to both never-leavers and returnees, a pattern reflecting the importance of migration over selection. Among immigrants, coming to the US at a younger age is associated with higher BMI and WHR levels. And longer length of residence in the US is related to higher BMI. While higher Vietnamese language proficiency is related to a lower BMI level, being bilingual (proficient in both English and Vietnamese) is associated with lower risks for being overweight. The distinct pattern of results suggests that more problematic weight status and fat distribution among Vietnamese immigrants relative to Vietnamese nationals are not artifacts of the types of persons choosing to emigrate, but rather are due to acculturation to American diet and lifestyles. While efforts to promote and maintain traditional patterns of diet and lifestyle are likely to help Vietnamese and other immigrants avoid the perils of American patterns, facilitating a bi-cultural orientation is perhaps the most realistic approach for preserving protective features of the culture of origin with regard to body weight and fat distribution.

Linguistic and temporal proxy measures for acculturation were independent variables along with ethnicity, plus controls for gender, age, education, and income in multivariate analyses. About one-fifth of contrasts between non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, English-interviewed Hispanics, and Spanish-interviewed Hispanics were statistically significant (Bonferroni-corrected) and of medium or higher affect size, with most featuring the Spanish-interviewed Hispanics. Knowledge variables featured the most significant differences. Specifically, Spanish-interviewed Hispanics reported less concern, familiarity with pollution, recognition of high pollution, and vigorous outdoor activity, and greater belief that government overregulates pollution than English-interviewed Hispanics (and than the other two groups on most of these variables too). English-interviewed Hispanics did not differ from non-Hispanic whites, but did on several variables from non-Hispanic blacks. Temporal proxies of acculturation among the foreign-born were far less significant, but concern and familiarity with air pollution increased with time spent in the United States, while belief in overregulation and a positive trend in New Jersey pollution increased with time in the nation of origin.

Participants: 1,789 Mexican Americans (60 years and older) from northern California. Main Outcome: Biomarkers (waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides, and high-density lipids) were used to construct the metabolic syndrome indicator using American Heart Association criteria. Main Predictor: Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans-II scores. Results: Higher acculturation scores were associated with a significantly lower risk for the metabolic syndrome for foreign-born, but not U.S.-born, Mexican Americans. Conclusion: Immigrant health advantages over U.S.-born Mexican Americans are not evident in older adulthood. Higher acculturation was associated with lowered metabolic syndrome risk among older foreign-born Mexican Americans. This suggests that the prevailing acculturative stress hypothesis may not apply to the health of older adults and that any negative relationship between acculturation and health found in younger adults may yield to different developmental health influences in later adulthood.

Yet new assimilation theory and structural theories of health behavior imply variation in health assimilation as immigrants and their families interact with different US social institutions throughout the day. We test this idea by analyzing how two indicators of dietary assimilation—food acculturation and healthy eating—vary throughout the day as Mexican children in immigrant households consume food in different institutional settings. Using individual fixed-effects models and data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we find that Mexican children in immigrant households (N = 2,337) engage in 'dietary code-switching,' eating more acculturated but not necessarily less healthy food in schools and more acculturated but less healthy food in restaurants compared to homes. Findings advance theory and knowledge about how social institutions condition dietary assimilation in particular and health assimilation more broadly.

  Abstract = {Acculturation strategy, a significant predictor of immigrant adaptation, has been under-studied with Asian Americans, in particular, Asian American youth. Using person-oriented latent profile analysis, this study identified acculturation strategies among Korean American early adolescents living in the Midwest. Two-hundred ninety-one families were interviewed in 2007 that included 220 youth (mean age 13, 47.7 \% female), along with 272 mothers and 164 fathers (N = 656). They were re-interviewed in 2008 (N = 588). The study found three distinct acculturation strategies: separation (11.8 \%, n = 26), integrated bicultural (66.9 \%, n = 150), and modest bicultural (21.3 \%, n = 44). Integrated bicultural youth reported the strongest sense of ethnic identity and the most favorable characteristics, providing empirical support for the benefit of biculturalism. The findings further suggest that separation may not be as detrimental as previously thought, and modest bicultural—biculturalism that is not fully developed—may in fact be less desirable among Korean American youth.

Participants were 30 adolescents (15 immigrant and 15 autochthons) selected form a sample of 884 adolescents (from which 204 were immigrants). Data regarding quality of life was collected applying the Friendship Quality Scale and the Vancouver Index of Acculturation to all the participants (n = 884). According to the punctuation of the questionnaires a subsample was chosen, the Biographical Grid was applied to 30 participants; the immigrants group was also asked to write a text. Results indicate that both perceived quality of life and self-esteem of immigrant’s group are lower than the autochthons’ while narrative disruption is higher. A deeply explanation about some of the causes of these results is provided by the narratives’ analysis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)}

They reported past traumatic events, social network, acculturation indices, trust in services, and mental health as well as usage of mental and somatic health services. Structural equation modeling (SEM) with multigroup procedure was applied. First, past traumatic events were associated with seeking more mental health services, indirectly mediated through increased risk for mental health problems in all three ethnic groups. Second, acculturation played a significant role in the use of mental and somatic health services only in Kurds and social networks in Kurds and Russians. The unique culturally influenced dynamics in help-seeking behavior should be considered in the development of health services. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)}

  Abstract = {Purpose: To determine whether a high rate of postpartum depression (PPD), previously found in immigrant Hispanic women at a community clinic, would also be found in a community sample. Data sources: Sixty women from local community settings were given the PPDS-S instrument and the General Acculturation Index to screen for PPD symptoms. Data were then compared with previously published community clinic data. Conclusion: Sixty percent of the immigrant Hispanic women showed significant PPD. The only statistically significant positive predictive factor for increased PPD symptoms was having a previous history of depression. In addition, 54\% had an elevated symptom content profile score for suicidal thinking. Implications for practice: Health practitioners should be aware of a potentially high rate of PPD in this population, especially in light of previously studied increased rates of suicide attempts in Latinas. If a prior history of depression is predictive of PPD, it is possible that many of the mothers in our sample suffered from depression prior to the postpartum period, but were not appropriately diagnosed or treated. Recommendations for outreach and further research are discussed. In particular, further research regarding the prenatal prevalence of depression in immigrant Hispanic women is recommended in order to further understand the high incidence of PPD.

  Abstract = {Distinct bodies of research have examined the link between victimization and psychological distress and cultural variables and psychological health, but little is known about how cultural variables affect psychological distress among Latino victims. Substantial research has concluded that Latino women are more likely than non-Latino women to experience trauma-related symptoms following victimization. In addition, examination of different types of cultural adaptation has found results supporting the idea that maintaining ties with one’s culture of origin may be protective against negative mental health outcomes. The present study evaluates the effect of victimization, immigrant status, and both Anglo and Latino orientation on psychological distress in a national sample of Latino women. Results indicate that along with the total count of victimization experiences, Anglo and/or Latino orientation were strong predictors of all forms of psychological distress. Anglo orientation also functioned as a moderator between victimization and psychological distress measures for anger, dissociation, and anxiety. The results suggest a more nuanced and complex interaction between cultural factors, victimization, and psychological distress. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

One sample was from west central Florida (low Korean density area; n = 672), and the other from the New York City metropolitan area (high Korean density area; n = 420). The average level of acculturation was lower among older Korean Americans in New York, compared to those living in Florida. In the hierarchical regression models with the New York sample, acculturation was initially significant in predicting depressive symptoms; however, its impact was gradually attenuated and eventually became nonsignificant with the sequential entry of control variables. On the other hand, in the Florida sample, the impact of acculturation on depressive symptoms remained significant throughout the models. The results suggest that the level and importance of acculturation may differ by geographic locations and invite further contextual research in immigrant populations.

Further, their investigation of whether earlier or contemporaneous experiences of discrimination influenced developmental outcomes in middle adolescence indicated differential effects, with contemporaneous experiences of discrimination affecting socioemotional adjustment, whereas earlier discrimination was more influential for academic performance. Finally, they found a persistent negative effect of acculturation on the link between discrimination and adolescents’ developmental outcomes, such that those adolescents who were more acculturated (in this case, higher in American orientation) experienced more deleterious effects of discrimination on both socioemotional and academic outcomes.

First, individuals who have been in the United States longer report a greater degree of dietary change. Second, after controlling for behavioral characteristics and preexisting diet-related conditions (diagnoses of high blood pressure and diabetes prior to coming to the United States), more dramatic levels of change in diet are associated with higher measures of body mass index. Based on respondents' comparisons of their current health to their health just prior to their most recent trip to the United States, change in diet as a result of immigrating to the United States is positively correlated with both better health and worse health. Among individuals reporting greater levels of dietary change, those with worse health have been in the United States for longer and are more likely to report the use of English at work than those reporting better health, factors that indicate acculturation and exposure to broader U. S. society. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

Using longitudinal data on self-rated health and the incidence of chronic conditions from the New Immigrant Survey (2003, 2007), I examine the contemporaneous and longitudinal associations between interethnic social capital and health. The results show evidence for a positive long-term effect of linguistic integration on health status, but no cross-sectional associations were observed. Overall, these results highlight the possible role of network processes in linking English-language use with immigrant health and the time-dependent nature of the relationship between linguistic integration and health status.

While the theory has been interpreted in many different ways, we emphasize its implications for the important role of social context: both processes and consequences of assimilation should depend on the local social context in which immigrants are embedded. We derive empirically falsifiable hypotheses about the interaction effects between social context and assimilation on immigrant children’s well-being. We then test the hypotheses using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Our empirical analyses yield two main findings. First, for immigrant adolescents living in non-poverty neighborhoods, we find assimilation to be positively associated with educational achievement and psychological well-being but also positively associated with at-risk behavior. Second, there is little empirical evidence supporting our hypotheses derived from segmented assimilation theory. We interpret these results to mean that future research would be more fruitful focusing on differential processes of assimilation rather than differential consequences of assimilation.

While South Asians and East Asians defy the classical assimilation theory with their strong resistance to intermarriage within the mainstream despite their high degree of structural assimilation, Southeast Asians display high rates of such marital assimilation. Europeans, as predicted by classical theory, evince high rate of marital assimilation. Latin Americans and Southeast Asians lie in between the two extremes of Europeans and other Asian subgroups. While they seem to follow a path of segmented assimilation by demonstrating within-region endogamy, compared to Europeans they have only a slightly higher propensity to marry within their nationality, suggesting ongoing assimilation along classical lines.

Objective: The relationships between depressive symptoms, acculturation, and acculturative stress among immigrants from the former Soviet Union were examined in this descriptive study. Design: Eighty immigrants from the former Soviet Union who had immigrated within the past 20 years were recruited in various community locations. Results: Participants (N = 80), including recent and longer residing immigrants, reported elevated depressive symptoms and acculturative stress. Acculturative stress predicted depressive symptoms, controlling for dominant culture (American) immersion. However, length of time in the United States was not associated with depressive symptoms, ethnic culture immersion, or acculturative stress. Conclusions: Our results suggest that elevated depressive symptoms are related to acculturative stress but are not confined to the initial adjustment period. Steps to decrease acculturative stress might help decrease depressive symptoms in immigrants regardless of the number of years lived in the United States.

  Abstract = {The process of acculturation observed in immigrants is part of an adjustment to the values and norms of a new society, and possibly the loss of norms of the society of origin. Acculturation has been linked to stress-related psychological disorders such as depression. The present study investigates the relationship between three acculturation domains (everyday life behaviors, wishful orientation/nostos, and ethnic identity) and symptoms of depression in a sample of foreign immigrants living in Athens, Greece. The sample consisted of 317 immigrants who visited two non-governmental organization polyclinics. All participants were interviewed using the Immigrant Acculturation Scale (IAS) and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The results showed that 133 (42\%) out of the 317 interviewees were in a depressive state (CES-D{\textgreater}15). The main finding was that high CES-D scores were related to low scores in the IAS Everyday Life and Wishful Orientation factors, while no relationship was found between depressive symptomatology and the IAS Identity factor. Short duration of stay in Greece, lack of steady job, and lack of residence permit were also related to high CES-D scores. In conclusion, adaptation to mainstream culture daily behaviors as well as the wish to integrate with individuals from the mainstream culture and settle permanently in the new country could be seen as part of an adaptive mechanism that protects the individual from experiencing depressive symptomatology.

  Abstract = {This study aimed to compare the adaptation of two groups of migrant Chinese adolescents with their nonmigrant peers. The migrant adolescents included 55 Chinese migrant adolescents who migrated to Australia (Chinese-Australian) and 111 China-born adolescents who migrated to Hong Kong (Chinese-Hong Kong). The nonmigrant adolescents included 157 Anglo-Australian adolescents residing in Australia and 456 Hong Kong-born Chinese adolescents residing in Hong Kong. There were three research questions in this study. First, would there be any differences in the adaptation of Chinese migrant adolescents in different societies of settlement? Second, would migrant adolescents experience more adaptation problems than nonmigrant adolescents? Third, would there be any differences in the adaptation of adolescents in the two societies, Australia and Hong Kong? It was hypothesized that: (1) mainland Chinese migrant adolescents in Hong Kong would experience more adaptation problems than Chinese migrant adolescents in Australia; (2) migrant adolescents would report better adaptation than nonmigrant adolescents; (3) adolescents in Hong Kong would report poorer adaptation than adolescents in Australia. The participants were requested to complete a questionnaire on various adaptation outcome measures including life satisfaction, self-esteem, psychological symptoms, academic satisfaction, and behavior problems. The results indicated that Chinese-Australian adolescents reported better psychological adaptation but Chinese-Hong Kong adolescents reported better sociocultural adaptation. Adolescents resident in Australia reported higher psychological adaptation but lower sociocultural adaptation than those in Hong Kong. Migrant adolescents reported better psychological and sociocultural adaptation than their nonmigrant counterparts. The results were discussed in relation to the social and educational systems of the two societies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

  Abstract = {Aims: To explore how and to what extent acculturation and immigration affect Chinese-American immigrant women’s breast cancer experience. Background: Acculturation is an important indicator for immigrant health. Less empirical research has been conducted on the association between acculturation and breast cancer experience among Chinese immigrant women in the USA. Design: A mixed methods study. Methods: A total of 107 Chinese-American women with breast cancer completed the structured questionnaire survey, and 16 women completed face-to-face in-depth interviews. Results: In the quantitative findings, acculturation was related to health beliefs, social support and life stress. Cultural interpretations of the qualitative information are offered to show that breast cancer experience was intertwined with cultural adaptation in a given immigrant environment. Chinese cultural beliefs persistently, even after years of immigration, guide Chinese-American immigrant women to respond to breast cancer across the meaning of health and illness, family ties and involvement and social interaction. Conclusion: Our findings show that acculturation is related to health beliefs, social support and life stress in the trajectory of breast cancer adaptation among Chinese-American immigrant women. Life stresses derived from immigration bring additional difficulties for immigrant women living with cancer. Relevance to clinical practice: This study pinpoints that traditional cultural beliefs and immigration stress may influence Chinese-American women to cope with breast cancer. To promote culturally sensitive cancer care for immigrants, healthcare professionals should be aware of and learn intercultural competence. Ethnic social support or outreach healthcare programme may benefit new immigrant families or the immigrant families, who lack social connection, to cope with cancer.

  Abstract = {Introduction: This study examines the relations among native and host country acculturation, identity distress, and internalizing symptoms among multicultural adolescent refugees (N = 33) resettled to the United States from a range of countries including Cuba, Iraq, Jordan, Haiti, Colombia, and Venezuela. Despite previous research supporting the advantages of developing a bicultural style to acculturation, mixed results have been found regarding native and host country acculturation patterns among resettled refugees and how these patterns may be associated with refugee mental health outcomes. Methods: The objective of this study was not only to consider the roles that US and native acculturation may play on the self-report of identity distress and internalizing symptoms among refugee adolescents more broadly, but also to consider the role various dimensions of acculturation (e.g., cultural identity, language competence, and cultural competence) may play for refugee adolescents post-resettlement. Results and Conclusions: The study findings indicate that native acculturation, and more specifically native cultural identity, may serve as significant protective factors against identity distress among adolescent refugees post-resettlement, with native cultural identity additionally serving as a protective factor against internalizing symptoms. US acculturation was not found to be significantly associated with identity distress or internalizing symptoms, nor were the acculturative dimensions of language learning (i.e., English and native language competencies), cultural knowledge (i.e., US and native cultural knowledge competencies), or US cultural identity. Recommendations and implications for practice and future research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)}

  Abstract = {The mixed method study largely followed on the work of Mona Amer (2005). It is a cross-sectional view of 100 non-U.S. born Arab Muslims living in the U.S. Using a non-random convenience sample of individuals from multiple U.S. cities, the study examined the hypotheses that H1: level of perceived discrimination will correlate with level of acculturation in the sample H2: degree of religiosity, degree of ethnic identity, and level of family functioning will mediate the relationship between perceived discrimination and level of acculturation in the sample, H3: controlling for extraneous variables (time spent in Arab world and gender) will account for the relationship between perceived discrimination and level of acculturation. This information was obtained by a socio-demographic questionnaire, the Schedule of Racist Events Modified for Use with Arab American Persons (SRE-AA), the Perceived Religious Discrimination Scale (PRDS), the Vancouver Index of Acculturation- Modified Arab Version (VIA-A), the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure - Revised (MEIM-R), the Family Assessment Device General Functioning subscale (FAD-GF), and the Index of Religiosity (IR). Participants responded to three narrative items. Two VIA-A subscales measured level of acculturation and six variables were both taken together and used separately to measure perceived discrimination (PRDS subscales-Religious; SRE-AA subscales-Racial). Quantitative analysis found a positive association was demonstrated between VIA-A North American subscale scores and the combined subscales measuring perceived discrimination (SRE-AA, PRDS). Also perceived discrimination as measured by the SRE-AA In the Past Year subscale correlated with acculturation as measured by the VIA-A-North American subscale. A negative correlation was also found between VIA-A Cultural Heritage subscale and SRE-AA In U.S. However, none of the variables in H2 mediated these relationships. Gender and number of years spent in the Arab world ultimately did not significantly contribute to the model. Qualitative analysis found several themes associated with discrimination and acculturation in the U.S. For example family integrity is an important factor in the lives of the participants, as is safety, freedom, and seeking out greater opportunities. Participants maintain lives in the U.S. and continue to adapt in their host culture despite perceived discrimination. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

  Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of acculturation on immigrant consumers’ loyalty. The authors posit that the acculturation orientation of immigrants determines their consumer loyalty to both ethnic and mainstream brands and stores. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of Hispanic consumers in the USA and consumers from the former Soviet Union in Israel, this study tests a model in which two acculturation continua, original culture maintenance and host culture adaptation, serve as antecedents for immigrants’ consumer loyalty. Findings: Acculturation determines the extent of immigrants’ consumer loyalty. Both acculturation continua are associated with distinct loyalty patterns that are similar across the two immigrant groups. Research limitations/implications: Despite sampling limitations, the paper demonstrates that immigrants’ acculturation orientation influences their loyalty to ethnic and mainstream brands and stores. Shared by ethnic consumers in two culturally diverse markets, this relationship transcends geographic boundaries. Practical implications: The results provide insights for marketers with respect to the development of segmentation and positioning strategies and tactical implementations that address the preferences of ethnic consumers. Social implications: This paper highlights the importance of understanding the unique needs of ethnic consumers and addressing them. Successful integration of immigrant consumers into the marketplace can also help in their integration into the host society at large. Originality/value: Findings shed light on the commonalities and differences among immigrant groups in different national settings. The paper highlights the role of cultural transition as a key experience that affects immigrants regardless of specific environmental or situational circumstances.

  Abstract = {Background: To consider the changes in overall diet quality following migration we examined the associations of acculturation variables and education level with diet in Surinamese South Asian and Surinamese Afro-Caribbean origin on the one hand, and ethnic Dutch residents of the Netherlands on the other. Surinam is a former Dutch colony in South America. Methods: We randomly selected men and women aged 35-60 years: ethnic Dutch, n = 552; South Asian, n = 306; Afro-Caribbean, n = 660. Intakes of fruit, vegetables, red meat, fish, vegetable oils, breakfast and salt were measured using a short questionnaire that formed the basis for a 'diet quality indicator' score. Highest education was measured and acculturation of the Surinamese groups was assessed by age at migration, number of resident years and a scale measure of social contacts with ethnic Dutch. Results: Compared with ethnic Dutch, both Surinamese groups scored higher on overall diet quality (P ≤ 0.001) but some aspects of diet (breakfast and salt use) were less prudent. Education was positively associated with diet quality in ethnic Dutch (P ≤ 0.01), but not consistently so in Surinamese. Associations with social contact with ethnic Dutch varied for different quality aspects of the diet. Residence duration (mean = 22 years) and age at migration (mean = 21 years) were not associated with diet. Conclusions: A greater degree of acculturation does not necessarily lead to a less healthful diet in migrants. In addition, the association of education level with diet may differ for migrant groups. The diet of migrants differ from host populations, suggesting that migrant groups should be considered in the development of nutrition health promotion activities.

Using data from the Longitudinal Surveys of Immigrants to Australia, the paper examines the influence of three measures of health—self-reported health status, the presence of a long-term health condition and mental health status—on the economic participation of humanitarian migrants. Multivariate logistic regression is used to control for other factors known to affect immigrants’ economic participation, such as age, skills and English language proficiency, to see if health has an independent effect. The results show that migrants with poor physical health are less likely than migrants with good health to be in the work force. Mental health status affects the economic participation of male but not female migrants. The findings provide important empirical evidence of the significant role of health in the economic integration of migrants of refugee background.

  Abstract = {The relationship between assimilation and the well-being of immigrant children has been the focus of debate in the recent sociological literature. Much of this work has questioned whether classical theories of immigrant adaptation, which assumed assimilation to be an integral part of the process of upward mobility for immigrants, are still applicable to today's immigrant children. This study reevaluates the applicability of classical assimilation theory with a comprehensive empirical assessment of the relationship between assimilation and the well-being of Hispanic and Asian immigrant adolescents. Using Add Health data, we examine the effect of different aspects of assimilation on educational achievement, psychological well-being, and at-risk behaviors. We find that the effect of assimilation varies greatly depending on the ethnic group and outcome under consideration, but that it is generally related to both greater academic achievement and more at-risk behavior. We conclude that assimilation theory is still relevant, but suggest an interpretation that emphasizes a process of decreasing differences between groups rather than either detrimental or beneficial effects of assimilation.

  Abstract = {Objective: Acculturation studies conducted with refugees have predominantly concentrated on investigating the impact of acculturative stress on mental health, and have neglected to investigate the impact of cultural orientations towards the host and ethnic cultures. Furthermore, exposure to traumas is highly prevalent in refugees and strongly associated with mental health outcomes, however, rarely included in investigations of acculturative process of refugees. Method: Using structural equation modelling, this study tested an integrated model of the relationship between traumatic exposure, acculturative stress, host and ethnic cultural orientations and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety symptoms among 138 Bosnian refugees resettled in Australia and Austria. Results: The model showed an overall good fit and noteworthy amount of variance indicating that traumatic exposure is the strongest direct and indirect predictor of PTSD, depression and anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, acculturative stress was identified as a significant risk factor influencing host cultural orientation, mediating the effect of traumatic exposure on all mental health outcomes. Conclusion: Acculturative stress and cultural and social stressors that are related to acculturation need to be addressed alongside provision of effective psychotherapy, especially since they are significant impediments to host cultural orientation and constructive engagement with mental health services in refugees.

  Abstract = {When immigrant minority individuals engage in frequent and positive social contact with majority culture members, their emotions become a better fit with the majority norm; the increased fit is called emotional acculturation. In the current research, we test the prediction that high-quality interactions with majority others, in which minorities feel accepted, increase the likelihood of emotional fit. We also explore whether this prediction holds true for both positive and negative interactions with majority. To test this prediction, we conducted a 7-day daily diary study with minority students in Belgian middle schools (N = 117). Each day, participants reported one positive and one negative interaction at school. They subsequently evaluated each interaction (e.g., felt accepted), assessed their relationship with the interaction partner (e.g., our relationship is important to me), and rated their emotions. Analyses focused on the interactions with Belgian majority interaction partners. Emotional acculturation was computed for positive and negative interactions separately, by calculating the fit between the emotional pattern of the minority student and the average emotional pattern of a sample of majority participants (N = 106) who also took part in the daily diary. As predicted, we found higher emotional fit in positive interactions when immigrant minorities felt accepted by the interaction partner. In contrast to this finding for positive interactions, emotional fit for negative interactions was higher when minorities felt excluded by the interaction partner. Further analyses on the negative interactions suggested that minority adolescents felt more negative autonomy-promoting emotions (e.g., anger and frustration) when they perceived being excluded. Given that Belgian majority youth feel more autonomy-promoting emotions generally, minorities’ fit with majority patterns was higher. The results confirm our hypothesis that minorities’ fit with majority emotions is contingent on the quality of their interactions with majority, even if in negative interactions, high-quality interactions produced less rather than more emotional fit. Our findings suggest that emotional acculturation is not just a ‘skill’ that minority individuals acquire, but also a response to the ways in which interactions with majority others develop. Inclusive interactions, especially when they are positive, appear to align immigrant minority individuals with the majority norm. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)}

  Abstract = {Conceptualisations of attachment to one’s nation of origin reflecting a symbolic caregiver can be found cross-culturally in literature, art, and language. Despite its prevalence, the relationship with one’s nation has not been investigated empirically in terms of an attachment theory framework. Two studies employed an attachment theory approach to investigate the construct validity of symbolic attachment to one’s nation of origin, and its association with acculturation (operationalized as heritage and mainstream culture identification). Results for Study 1 indicated a three-factor structure of nation attachment; the factors were labelled secure-preoccupied, fearful, and dismissive nation attachment. Hierarchical linear modelling was employed to control for differing cultures across participants. Secure-preoccupied nation attachment was a significant predictor of increased heritage culture identification for participants residing in their country of birth, whilst dismissive nation attachment was a significant predictor of decreased heritage culture identification for international migrants. Secure-preoccupied nation attachment was also associated with higher levels of subjective-wellbeing. Study 2 further confirmed the validity of the nation attachment construct through confirmatory factor analysis; the three-factor model adequately fit the data. Similar to the results of Study 1, secure-preoccupied nation attachment was associated with increased levels of heritage culture identification and psychological well-being. Implications of the tripartite model of nation attachment for identity and well-being will be discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

  Abstract = {Subjective social status (SSS) reflects an individual's perception of her/his relative position in the social hierarchy. However, little is known about culturally-relevant, multilevel predictors of low SSS among low socioeconomic status (SES), minority populations. The goal of this study was to identify individual- and neighborhood-level variables predicting SSS among 297 Spanish-speaking Latino immigrant smokers living in several locations in Texas, with an emphasis on the association of SSS with acculturative and socioeconomic variables. Participants were recruited and enrolled through the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service from August 2002 to March 2004. Determinants of SSS were explored using a series of linear regressions. In analyses adjusting for demographics (including objective indicators of SES), speaking Spanish at home and work and living in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, respectively, were associated with low SSS. However, in analyses including demographics, acculturation, and neighborhood characteristics, only income, education, and acculturation remained associated with SSS. Consistent with results from a previous study in the area (Franzini \& Fernandez-Esquer, 2006), less acculturation predicted low SSS among immigrant Latino smokers. However, unlike previous research, these associations were maintained after controlling for SES. Results suggest that the density of less acculturated Latinos within economically deprived neighborhoods might account for the disappearance of neighborhood effects in the final model.

  Abstract = {Recent research suggests that cultural groups comprise subgroups differing in the combination of their self-identifications with their heritage and host cultures and following distinct trajectories of acculturation. This study aimed at identifying such subgroups, predicting group membership by pre-migration factors, and testing for acculturation-related experiences with the host culture over time. The sample comprised 366 adolescent diaspora migrants (59\% female, 16 years old) from the former Soviet Union to Germany. A person-oriented and longitudinal approach using growth mixture modeling revealed three subtypes of cultural identification change. The first subgroup (Idealists) comprised adolescents with high and stable identification with their host culture and low but increasing identification with their heritage culture. The second group (Skeptics) showed low and stable identification with their host culture and high but decreasing identification with their heritage culture. The third group (Realists) reported medium-level and stable identification with both host and heritage cultures. Group comparisons showed pre-migration differences: Idealists and Realists most likely spoke the host-culture language (i.e., German) as a native language and Idealists reported the highest level of maternal education. Membership in subgroups also related to adolescents’ perception of their current situation in the host culture: Idealists reported less acculturation-related hassles with respect to language and socio-cultural adaptation. Skeptics perceived lower expectations by natives to get in contact with natives and higher expectations to spend time with members of their immigrant group than the average immigrant. Results highlight the heterogeneity in immigrant populations and their specific needs before and after the actual migration. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)}

  Abstract = {Background: The purpose of this study was to compare rates of screening mammography among immigrant women in five Asian-American ethnic groups in California, and ascertain the extent to which differences in mammography rates among these groups are attributable to differences in known correlates of cancer screening. Methods: Using 2009 data from the California Health Interview Survey, we compared the rates of mammography among Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese immigrants 40 years and older. To assess the impact of Asian ethnicity on participation in screening, we performed multiple logistic regression analysis with models that progressively adjusted for acculturation, sociodemographic characteristics, access to health care, and breast cancer risk factors, and examined the predicted probabilities of screening after adjusting for these factors. Findings: Participation in screening mammography differed according to ethnicity, with Filipina and Vietnamese Americans having the highest rates and Korean Americans having the lowest rates of lifetime and recent (past 2 years) screening. These differences decreased substantially after adjusting for acculturation, sociodemographic factors, and risk factors of breast cancer, but differences remained, most notably for Korean Americans, who continued to have the lowest predicted probability of screening even after adjustment for these factors. Conclusions: This analysis draws attention to low mammography screening rates among Asian-American immigrants, especially recent immigrants who lack health insurance. Given that their breast cancer incidence is rising with length of stay in the United States, it is important to increase regular mammography screening in these groups.

Our study focuses on psychological adaptation of two main immigrant groups in Spain that differ in cultural distance to the host society and level of societal acceptance: adolescents of Moroccan and Ecuadorean origin. Our findings show, first, that mainstream cultural orientation is positively related to psychological adaptation, whereas perceived ethnic discrimination is negatively associated with adaptation. Second, the relationship between ethnic cultural orientation and psychological adaptation and between length of residence in Spain and adaptation is stronger for the Moroccan youth than for their Ecuadorean peers. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

In our model, we include two types of cultural identity (i.e., identity with the local society and with the home country), which are expected to have differential impacts on the outcome variables. We further propose that assimilation attitude and perception of discrimination serve as potential mediators in the above relationships. Several hypotheses are formulated and tested with a data set collected from a survey of 501 new immigrants from Mainland China to Hong Kong. The results of structural equation modeling indicate that local identity is positively related to assimilation attitude, which is then associated with sociocultural adaptation and life satisfaction of the respondents. Additionally, Mainland identity is found to be positively associated with immigrants’ perceived discrimination, which is then negatively associated with their sociocultural adaptation and life satisfaction.

Hierarchical multiple regression was used to investigate the influence of: 1) attachment styles (pre-occupied, dismissive, secure, and fearful); 2) family relations (intergenerational conflict and family cohesion); 3) ethnic (belonging, centrality, and exploration) and national identities; and 4) interactions between the components of ethnic and national identity. Controlling for demographic factors, results indicated that a preoccupied attachment style and experiences of acculturative intergenerational conflict exacerbated EIC, whereas family cohesion, ethnic identity centrality, and ethnic group belonging protected against EIC. It was also found that national identity moderated the effects of ethnic identity on EIC. Overall, these findings suggest positive self-regard, family cohesion, and integrated achieved identities should be promoted for immigrant youth.

Results: Foreign-born Mexican-Americans were more likely to be low risk than non-Hispanic Whites after adjustment for all covariates (Odds Ratio [OR]: 1.53; 95\% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.00, 2.34). In contrast, U.S.-born Mexican-Americans were less likely to be low risk compared to Whites (OR: 0.60; 95\% CI: 0.43, 0.84). Differences between foreign-born and U.S.-born Mexican-Americans were largely attenuated after adjustment for acculturation indicators. Conclusions: Our findings support the healthy migrant hypothesis and suggest that acculturation-related factors may be important drivers of ethnic and nativity-related differences in low cardiovascular risk.

  Abstract = {Aims: Recent studies indicate that alcohol use is increasing among Asian American populations and that acculturation impacts alcohol use among immigrants in the USA. We investigated the longitudinal relationship between three domains of acculturation (traditionalism, biculturalism, assimilation) and alcohol use among 302 Vietnamese and Cambodian women in Washington State. Methods: Data were obtained from the Cross Cultural Families Project (CCF), a 5-year longitudinal investigation of a random sample of Vietnamese and Cambodian immigrant families living in Washington State. Alcohol use was measured with a three item scale assessing frequency and quantity of use, and binge drinking. Acculturation was measured with the Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identity Acculturation Scale. Linear mixed effects regression models were estimated to assess the impact of acculturation on alcohol use among the overall sample and among a sub-sample of only women who consumed any alcohol. Results: A majority of the sample, 73.2\%, reported no alcohol use. In the overall sample, none of the three acculturation domains were significantly associated with drinking. Among a sub-sample of only those who reported any alcohol use, however, a greater degree of traditional cultural identification (β = −0.94, SE = 0.44, P = 0.03) and a greater degree of biculturalism (β = −1.33, SE = 0.53, P = 0.01) were associated with lower levels of use. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that acculturation did not impact alcohol use prevalence but that it did affect the drinking pattern among alcohol consumers. Clinicians should be cognizant that certain aspects of cultural identification are important contributors to drinking behavior among alcohol consumers in these populations.

The findings suggest that adherence to Korean identity appears to be associated with health service utilization. This is evident in the immigrants’ evaluation of the U.S. health services as compared to those of Korea, and the consideration given by these immigrants to seeking health services in Korea instead of the United States. Such concerns on the part of these immigrants have important implications for health researchers, as they highlight the significance of immigrants’ transnational experiences and their sense of personal agency in the use of health care.

The present study extends research on Black Caribbean immigrants’ acculturative process by assessing how this group’s experience of the racial context (racial public regard, ethnic public regard, and cultural race-related stress) influences its engagement in African American culture (i.e., adoption of values and behavioral involvement). Data were collected from 93 Black participants of Caribbean descent, ranging in age from 13 to 45 and analyzed using a stepwise hierarchical regression. The findings highlighted that when Black Caribbean-descended participants perceived that the public held a favorable view of their racial group they were more likely to engage in African American culture. In contrast, when participants perceived that the public held a favorable view of their ethnic group (e.g., Haitian) they were less likely to engage in African American culture. Furthermore, among participants experiencing low levels of cultural race-related stress, the associations between racial public regard and engagement with African American culture were amplified. However, for participants experiencing high cultural race-related stress, their engagement in African American culture did not change as a function of racial public regard. These findings may suggest that, for Black Caribbean immigrants, the experience of the racial context influences strategies that serve to preserve or bolster their overall social status and psychological well-being in the United States.

Data analysis utilized SPSS. Independent-samples-t- tests and Pearson product-moment correlations were conducted. Results indicated no statistically significant difference in socio-cultural adaptation by: acculturation, coping, and migration with family. Additionally, there was no statistically significant difference in psychological adjustment by acculturation and participation in a faith community. Results revealed a positive correlation between psychological adjustment and socio-cultural adaptation and a statistically significant difference in socio-cultural adaptation by participation in faith community. Further research into adaptation and coping among East African immigrants is recommended. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

Two measures of vulnerability (social integration and legal/economic status) as well as HIV knowledge, risk behaviour, and demographic factors were tested for association with HIV testing. Data were drawn from a survey of 2600 sexually active migrants age 15–59 in multiple provinces of Thailand. The measures of social integration (AOR = 1.14(95 \% CI 1.09, 1.20) female; AOR = 1.12 (95 \%CI 1.05, 1.19) male) and legal-income status (AOR = 1.12 (95 \% CI 1.07, 1.18) female; AOR = 1.31 (95 \%CI 1.20, 1.42) male) were positively related to the odds of reporting an HIV test for both male and female migrants. Exposure to AIDS programming including attending an AIDS meeting and possessing AIDS knowledge was also related to an increase in HIV testing. In addition, reproductive health factors including sexual risk behavior and childbirth increased the rate of HIV testing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

  Abstract = {Immigrant adolescents must negotiate two cultures: the host culture and their native culture. This study explored how self-esteem is moderated by the effect of linguistic acculturation and context. An ordinary least-squares regression model, controlling for fixed effects, produced results supporting the hypothesis that linguistic acculturation moderates the effect of context on self-esteem. The self-esteem of Hispanic adolescents who were less linguistically acculturated was found to be more favorable when with family than with friends and the reverse was found for the more linguistically acculturated participants. Adolescents in the middle of the linguistic acculturation process had the widest variance in self-esteem between times they were with their families and times in other contexts; they experienced more positive self-esteem with anyone but family. Findings underscore the need to better understand the complex process of linguistic acculturation and its effects on self-esteem. This research also demonstrates the practical utility of a fixed-effects model for reducing bias in cross-cultural research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

  Abstract = {Using multigenerational data, intermarriage rates were examined among non-White, non-European immigrants to test two competing assimilation theories: classic assimilation theory and segmented assimilation theory. Later generations of Asian and Hispanic immigrants were more likely to outmarry than their first-generation relatives, an outcome predicted by both theories. High achieving Asians were not more likely to engage in outmarriage, whereas educational achievement was positively correlated with outmarriage rates among Hispanics. Classic assimilation theory predicts outmarriage only after structural assimilation is achieved; therefore, this study provided more evidence to support segmented assimilation theory. However, low socioeconomic status Hispanics and Asians were not more likely to outmarry non-Whites, as segmented assimilation theory would suggest.

  Abstract = {This dissertation investigated the extent of L2 (English) acquisition and L1 (Russian) maintenance of two age groups of Russian immigrants in the US and examined the relationship between participantsâ€™ current language dominance and culture dominance. The study also aimed at enhancing theoretical knowledge about the methodology of assessing language and culture dominance and at establishing which of the measures used here (self-reports of language proficiency, three lexical fluency tests, writing tasks, and a culture questionnaire) are the most accurate and practical for determining the more dominant language and culture. In addition to quantitative data, interviews provided insights into the participants' views and opinions on their language and culture and were used to supplement the statistical results with personal comments. The results indicate a surprisingly high level of first language and culture maintenance in the younger group together with highly successful L2 acquisition and acculturation, marking this group as rather balanced bilingually and bi-culturally. The older participants, on the other hand, clearly maintain dominance in both Russian language and Russian culture. Significant correlations established between different language proficiency measures carry methodological importance for future studies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

  Abstract = {The study involved the development of an acculturative hassles measure for Russian-speaking elderly refugees and immigrants. The measure is based on an ecological perspective, which focuses on hassles involving person-environment transactions and occurring in varied life domains. Conceptual and methodological issues in existing instruments are reviewed and efforts to address current limitations are incorporated into the instrument development. Initial instrument development was guided by a series of semi-structured open-ended interviews with elders from the former Soviet Union. Items were identified to assess acculturative hassles in different life domains, such as extended family, social network, health, discrimination, and language. Next, a validity study was conducted with 312 elders from the former Soviet Union. Using both the overall hassles scale scores and its specific domains' scores, several predictions are made relating overall acculturative hassles to life satisfaction, psychological distress, and level of acculturation to both Russian and American cultures and relating domain-specific hassles to domain-specific outcomes. Overall, the scale was found to be reliable and valid with respect to its overall and domain scores. Furthermore, the scale was able to predict outcomes over and above effects of demographic variables and acculturation. Conceptual and methodological implications for the hassles scales development and validation procedures are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

  Abstract = {The principle question of this study pertained to the nature of the relationships between foreign language anxiety, acculturation, and acculturative stress as it is experienced by adult Spanish speaking immigrants living in the United States. In addition to the nature of the relationships between the constructs, the ways in which they are experienced by adult English learners were also investigated. Three inventories were adapted for delivery via a multimedia website. The English Language Anxiety Scale (Pappamihiel, 1999) adapted from the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (Horwitz, Horwitz \& Cope, 1986) was adapted for measuring anxiety. The Stephenson Multigroup Acculturation Scale (1999) was selected for measuring the degree of acculturation, and the Multidimensional Acculturative Stress Inventory (Rodriguez, Myers, Bingham Mira, Flores, \& Garcia-Hernandez, 2002) was selected for measuring acculturative stress. From the ninety-five original surveys that were begun on the website, fifty-five cases were selected for analysis. Results showed no significant correlations between the major constructs; however, interesting correlations among various individual items in the scales existed. Additionally, combined with the analysis of six semi-structured interviews, results indicate that the concept of foreign language classroom anxiety should be moved beyond the perimeter of the classroom for the case of adult immigrants learning English in an English-speaking country. Results further indicate that language acquisition in the adopted country when accompanied by the regular processes of acculturation may produce higher levels of language anxiety, not only in the degree of anxiety but also in the proportion of students dealing with anxiety when speaking English. The construct of language acculturation anxiety is proposed to identify the combined effect of language anxiety, acculturation, and acculturative stress. Implications for the instruction of adult English students are made, as well as recommendations for future studies, including considerations when using a computer mediated delivery with this population.

  Abstract = {Studies have identified perceived racism as one type of social stress that is believed to contribute to hypertension, though no studies to date have examined the relationship between perceived racism and blood pressure among foreign-born Mexicans living in the United States (U.S.). In addition, studies have shown that acculturation may increase levels of perceived discrimination among foreign-born Mexicans living in the U.S. The primary purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between perceived racism and ambulatory blood pressure among a convenience sample of 332 foreign-born Mexicans living in Utah County, Utah controlling for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and acculturation. This was done through the use of several multiple regression analyses using archival data collected at Brigham Young University. The Perceived Ethnic Discrimination Questionnaire--Community Version (Brief PEDQ--CV) was used to measure perceived racism. The Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans (ARSMA-II) was used to measure both language and general acculturation. Four blood pressure variables, including waking systolic blood pressure (WSBP), waking diastolic blood pressure (WDBP), sleeping systolic blood pressure (SSBP), and sleeping diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) were used as outcome variables in the regression analyses. A relationship between perceived racism and any of the ambulatory blood pressure variables used in this study was not found. In addition, English-language acculturation was not found to moderate the relationship between perceived racism and blood pressure in the sample of first generation Mexicans participating in this study. A moderating effect of general acculturation on the relationship between perceived racism and blood pressure was found when controlling for age, BMI, and gender, though this moderating effect disappeared when WDBP was included in the regression model. Implications of findings, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed.

  Abstract = {The present research represents an expansion of the acculturation gap-distress model by investigating the role of acculturation discrepancies in the adjustment of Vietnamese and Chinese young adults. A concurrent mixed-method nested, quantitative dominant design was employed. A comparison between actual and perceived sibling acculturation discrepancy was also examined as well as differences between Vietnamese and Chinese young adults on the key study variables. Thematic analysis of the qualitative data was conducted to further shed light on the quantitative findings. Two samples were collected: the main data set comprised of 150 Vietnamese and Chinese young adults and the sibling pairs data set comprised of 18 pairs of siblings. Questionnaires on self-reported and perceived bilinear acculturation, sibling relationship quality, psychological adjustment, intercultural adjustment difficulties and demographic data were administered online. Qualitative data was collected using eight open-ended questions regarding sibling acculturation discrepancy and sibling relations. Quantitative results showed that sibling acculturation discrepancy uncorrelated with psychological adjustment or intercultural adjustment difficulties. Further, sibling conflict moderated the relationship between perceived sibling heritage acculturation discrepancy and intercultural competence difficulties and predicted psychological adjustment. Analyses also revealed that siblings accurately perceived acculturation discrepancies. Further, actual and perceived acculturation discrepancy were both associated with psychological adjustment and intercultural competence difficulties. Finally, Chinese young adults were more likely to report higher heritage acculturation and sibling warmth than Vietnamese young adults. Qualitative results revealed seven themes of which three were related to the quantitative results. First, siblings defined acculturation in both multi-factorial and bilinear terms. A multi-factorial and bilinear approach to acculturation measurement may have enhanced the present study. In addition, siblings were aware of differences in acculturation between themselves, but they employed many strategies to cope with perceived acculturation differences to help mitigate sibling conflict and distress. The association between sibling conflict and psychological adjustment found in this study may be related to the way siblings cope with acculturation differences. This study expands upon the acculturation gap-distress model to include siblings as an important context within which to study immigrant adjustment and adaptation. The implications of its findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

  Abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the relationship between attachment styles and acculturation strategies of the 3rd wave (1978-1984) of Iranian immigrants aging in the U.S. to determine which factors may be most associated with psychological distress and quality of life. Attachment theory can help us understand how immigrants develop adaptive ways of relating, as well as coping with change and loss inherent in the migration process. This study utilized a non-experimental, quantitative, correlational method and the sample consisted of 64 participants. They were administered a Demographics Questionnaire, Iranian Acculturation Scale, Relationship Scale Questionnaire, Brief Symptom Inventory-18, and Satisfaction With Life Scale. The data collected was analyzed using a Pearson-moment correlation, multiple regressions, as well as a mediation analysis to determine if level of acculturation is a mediator between attachment and psychological distress. Findings indicated that an individual's attachment style was more predictive of psychological distress than their degree of acculturation but both attachment and acculturation significantly predicted psychological distress and satisfaction with life. Specifically, fearful and preoccupied attachment scores significantly predicted higher report of symptoms and thus lower psychological distress. There was no significant relationship between attachment and acculturation nor between secure attachment and psychological distress. Furthermore, the independent variables (i.e., attachment styles) did not significantly predict the mediator (i.e., acculturation). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)}

  Abstract = {Nearly 35\% of the more than 55 million Hispanics who live in the United States are foreign-born (U.S. Census Bureau, 2016). The Pew Research Center (2017b) reported that in 2015, approximately 11 million of these were undocumented immigrants. Research has suggested that the mental health of Hispanics is indisputably connected to the immigration experience. Counselors predict that the impact of current political and societal disputes surrounding this population is having a detrimental effect on their mental health and, more specifically, their stress level. Clinicians and, therefore, counselor educators are called upon to the psychological needs of ethnic populations such as Hispanics from a framework that addresses cultural values, communication styles, and socioeconomic factors. Therefore, it is imperative that researchers work to provide counselor educators and clinicians with the tools necessary to assess, diagnose, treat, and support Hispanic clients. This study sought to examine how relevant stressors such as documentation status, spiritual coping, and acculturation precede stress and contribute to that literature. The sample in this study included 139 foreign-born adult Hispanics. The sample was recruited from the researchers established network with two local churches and a local health clinic, all with a predominantly Hispanic representation. Participants responded to the survey in person, anonymously. The complete survey included the Abbreviated Version of the Hispanic Stress Inventory for Immigrants, Spiritual Coping Strategies Scale, and the Psychological Acculturation Scale, and a demographic questionnaire, totaling 58 questions. A standard regression analysis was used to analyze the data, which indicated that documentation status, spiritual coping, and acculturation did not contribute to stress levels in the sample. Findings indicated a small correlation between documentation status and stress and no correlation with the other two variables. Implications for counselors and counselor educators and recommendations for future research are discussed in light of the observations made by the researcher.

  Keywords = {\#duplicate-citation-key, P-417},
  Abstract = {Research is needed to better understand the impact of migration on West African immigrants‘ mental health and their ability and willingness to seek traditional Western care. Therefore, the present quantitative study investigated the variance in attitudes toward seeking psychological help as predicted by degree of acculturation, severity of self-reported problems, and beliefs about the cause of mental health problems among West African immigrants in the U.S. The following research questions and hypothesis were addressed: What are the specific mental and physical health concerns of West African immigrants in the U.S.? Where do West African immigrants with mental health problems seek help? The hypothesis was that higher acculturation into the U.S. society, severity of self-reported problems, and interactional attribution beliefs about mental health problems would be significant predictors of attitudes toward seeking psychological help. Approximately 600 questionnaires were mailed to first generation West African immigrants. A total of 126 surveys were received representing a return rate of 21\%. Of this number 15 were not usable. Analyses were based on the remaining 111 surveys. Each survey packet included a demographic questionnaire, a referral list for national mental health, counseling and crisis services, a business reply envelope, and a battery of 4 instruments including the Attitude Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help Scale (ATSPPH), Behavioral Acculturation Scale (BAS), Brief Symptoms Inventory (BSI), and the Mental Health Locus of Origin Scale (MHLO). Descriptive statistics were computed (percentages \& frequencies) to answer the first and second research questions. In addition, one multiple regression, using forced entry method was performed to predict West African immigrants‘ attitudes toward seeking psychological help as measured by the total scores on the ATSPPH, using the BAS, BSI, and MHLO scores as predictors. Finally, Pearson product moment correlation analyses were performed among the variables in examining the regression results. The results identified interactional attribution beliefs about mental health problems as the only significant predictor. West African immigrants reported various concerns with their mental and physical health. In general, they reported preference for the use of informal systems of support to resolve their emotional concerns and the use of medical doctors for physical concerns.}

  Abstract = {The goals of the present research were to develop and assess the psychometric properties of a theoretically-derived acculturation measure specific to Korean-American immigrants, to replicate the results of an earlier study (Sung \& Wozniak, 1999) suggesting that Korean immigrants may be characterized by two different patterns of relational family values, one traditional and one acculturated, and to relate results of the acculturation measure to family values patterns. A total of 120 participants representing three different generational groups (1st, 1.5, 2nd) varying in age, socioeconomic status, and educational level were recruited from the local Korean immigrant population. Participants were seen individually in their homes and instructions and measures were given in the language of the subject's choice (Korean or English). Measures included the Korean Acculturation Scale (KAS), composed of 32-item Acculturation and 8-item Biculturality subscales, a 52-item Relational Family Values Q-Sort (RFVQ), and a 14-item demographic questionnaire. Results indicated that the Korean Acculturation Scale (KAS) had excellent internal consistency and test-retest reliability over a two-week interval. KAS Acculturation and Biculturality Subscale scores were generally found to relate in the expected direction to demographic variables. The RFVQ Q-factor analysis replicated the two-factor solution found by Sung and Wozniak (1999); and on the basis of patterns of factor loadings, three participant groups were identified. (a) Group 1 included those loading positively and significantly only on the Acculturated Korean Family Values factor; (b) Group 2 consisted of those loading positively and significantly on the Traditional Korean Family Values factor and variously on the Acculturated Korean Family Values factor; and (c) Group 3 was composed of those loading positively and significantly on the Acculturated Korean Family Values factor and negatively and significantly on the Traditional Korean Family Values factor. KAS Acculturation Subscale scores were highest for Group 3, followed in order by Groups 1 and 2. Although no statistically significant differences were found for Biculturality Subscale scores, there was a trend for Group 3 to be lowest in Biculturality.

  Abstract = {This dissertation is a study of contemporary Black African migration to the United States. It is motivated by the conundrum between these migrants' high pre-migration human capital and their lower-than-expected post-migration socioeconomic status in the U.S. Angled at the intersection of race and migration, this research is informed by four major bodies of theory—international migration theory, theories on racial hierarchy and race relations, contemporary assimilation theory, and social network theory. This research has a two-fold agenda: (1) to uncover how race/ethnicity and social class accommodate or obstruct the migration and assimilation of African immigrants and (2) to clarify how social networks in various contexts facilitate or constrain the assimilation of African-horn migrants in the U.S. This research employs an extended case method approach which is suitable for research that aims to reconstruct existing theory. The instruments include a survey on background information, in-depth interviews on migration history and adaptation process, survey instruments for network analysis, and 'shadowing' observations with Ghanaian and Nigerian immigrants residing in Maryland. A snowball sampling technique was used to recruit participants that vary by individual and contextual characteristics through school, work, and neighborhood-based associations, voluntary organizations, and field contacts. I find that Ghanaians and Nigerians migrate to the United States in pursuit of educational and occupational opportunity in a politically stable society. They use their human-cultural, social, and financial capital to acquire a vast array of visas in pursuit of the American Dream. However, their ability to successfully integrate into American society is circumscribed by their immigration status, race, gender, and class backgrounds as illustrated by their migration processes, educational experiences, workforce trajectories, and social integration patterns in the United States. While I st generation immigrants exhibit varying degrees of success, their determination and selective acculturation strategies—mainstream economic integration coupled with selective cultural assimilation—pave the way for subsequent cohorts and generations of Ghanaian and Nigerian immigrants to enjoy upward mobility in American society. These findings establish assimilation as a multigenerational process circumscribed by societal structure but also negotiated through immigrant agency.

  Abstract = {The number of refugees being uprooted fro their homes to seek refuge and resettlement in countries like the United State continues to grow, with large numbers being children. While each refugee grou has its own set of challenges when adjusting to a new country, a better underst nding of their needs may help facilitate their transition more quickly with lesser c allenges. This study investigated the adjustment of one such group - omali Bantus in a Midwestern U.S. city. Specifically, acculturation and school ad ptation of Somali Bantu refugee children was explored using the Differenti ted Multidimensional Model of Acculturation. Somali Bantu refugee children in 5 element ry schools were asked to complete a questionnaire that assessed their level of acculturation to American culture and level of retention of Somali Bantu cult re, at three levels i.e. language, identity, and behavior. The 5 ESL teach rs were asked to complete a questionnaire that assessed total difficulties in be aviors for each of their Somali Bantu student. Correlations, MANOVAs, and hier rchical regression analyses were used to analyze the data. v The findings of this study documented the ignificant role of school context in the acculturation and school adaptation of thes Somali Bantu refugee children. The findings demonstrated that age was tatistically, significantly, and negatively related to overall American Acculturati n (AAI) and statistically, significantly, and positively related to Proficiency evel Composite scores. These students' AAI scores were statistically, significantl ,and positively related to their Somali Acculturation Index (SAl) scores. Further are, SAl scores were statistically, significantly, and positively related to rades on Social Behavior and grades on Social Behavior and Work Study Habit were statistically, significantly, and positively related. Also, age and length of tim in the country were statistically, significantly, and positively related. The hierarchical regression analyses for I and ABA suggested that the demographic variables age, length of time in the S and gender did not contribute to any significant variance and school c ntributed a moderate variance to the overall AAI and ABA scores. School contri uted substantially more incremental variance to ALA and AlA than did the ther variables (age, length of time in the US and gender). Overall. the theoretic I model including age, length of time in the US, gender and school explained 18 25, 17 and 13 percent of the variance in the AAI, ALA, AlA and ABA respective y. The hierarchical regression analyses for S I, SLA, SIA and SBA suggested that the demographic variables age, Ie gth of time in the US and gender contributed marginally significant variance. School contributed substantially more incremental variance to SAl, S A and SBA and a small Vi incremental variance to SIA than did the other de agraphic variables. Overall, the theoretical model including age, length of time in the US, gender and school explained 36, 20, 15, and 41 percent of the varian e in the SAl, SLA, SIA, and SBA respectively. The hierarchical regression analyses for th school outcomes suggested that the demographic variables age, length of time in the US and gender contributed marginally significant variance in Total Difficulties and Proficiency Level Composite scores but none for Grades on S cial behavior and Work Study Habits. School contributed slightly more incremen al variance to Total Difficulties and Proficiency Level Composite scores a. Accult ration did not contribute to any significant variance in any of the school outcomes Overall, the theoretical model including age, length of time in the US, gender, sc 001, and American acculturation explained 26, 18, 16, and 38 percent of the variance and age, length of time in the US, gender, school, and Sam Ii acculturation explained 26, 22, 16, and 41 percent of the variance in the Total Difficulties, Grades on Social Behavior, Grades on Work Study Habits, and Prof ciency Level Composite scores, respectively.

  Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between acculturation level and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) prevalence in Central American immigrants in the United States. Central American immigrants represent a population that is a part of the Latino/Hispanic Diaspora in the United States. By the year 2050 the United States population will experience a great change in the ethnic/racial demographics and most will be former minorities comprising over 45\% racial minorities (U.S. Census, 2005). Thus, it becomes more important for counselor educators and other helping professionals to understand how to adequately assess the 'Latino' and be culturally sensitive --- especially since Central American immigrants come from diverse backgrounds, and although they may be labeled 'Hispanic', there is diversity within groups of ethnic minorities. This dissertation examined the research hypotheses: There is a relationship between acculturation level and PTSD among Central American immigrants in the United States. In addition, there are predictive relationships among the demographic variables. The null hypotheses presented are: There is no relationship between acculturation level and PTSD among Central American immigrants in the United States and additionally, there are no predictive relationships among the demographic variables. A Pearson correlation design was done to assess statistical significance (both positive and negative), and to examine if there was a relationship between acculturation level and PTSD. The alpha level was set at a significance level of .05. A standard Multiple Regression design was utilized to assess predictive relationships among the demographic variables with PTSD severity: migration reason, age, gender, migration year, and marital status. The sample of participants was n = 63 out of 100 participants who volunteered to participate in the study. The results show that there was a relationship between acculturation level and PTSD among Central American immigrants. Several instruments were utilized for this dissertation research to assess both acculturation level and prevalence or lack of PTSD severity. The AMAS-ZABB (Abbreviated Multidimensional Acculturation Scale) and the PCL-C (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Civilians) were utilized in this study. The results showed a positive correlation between acculturation level (U.S. identity, r = .289), Latino identity (r = .281), and PTSD. At an alpha level of alpha .01, age was positively correlated (r = .684) and acculturation level (English language) was negatively correlated with PTSD (r = -.465). Multiple R for regression was statistically significant when examining the demographic variables of age, acculturation level (English Language) and migration reason. The results were also statistically significant in predicting PTSD severity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)}

  Abstract = {This dissertation includes a qualitative analysis of individual interviews with 19 South Sudanese unaccompanied refugee minors (URMs) and a subsequent quantitative analysis based on 30 survey responses in an effort to understand how South Sudanese URMs have adjusted to their new country, the United States. Each of these studies concerns their sense of purpose, acculturation experiences, and identity development in relation to their educational and occupational achievements, as well as their psychological wellbeing over time. For the qualitative analysis, the participants were interviewed during two different phases of the study. The first set of in-depth individual interviews was conducted in 2007 (Phase 1) with 19 South Sudanese URMs who had resettled in the United States in 2001. From 2014--2015 (Phase 2), 11 of the 19 participants from Phase 1 were interviewed again. Using a modified grounded theory approach, these two sets of qualitative data were analyzed in terms of the participants' purpose development, multidimensional acculturation, identity reformation and integration, educational and occupational achievements, and overall life satisfaction. There are three theoretical frameworks that guide the current research project: a) Damon's purpose-development theory, b) Ferguson's tridimensional acculturation theory, and c) Portes and Zhou's segmented assimilation theory. Based on these three existing theories and their measurements, this study attempts to describe South Sudanese URMs' identified goals, life purposes, major achievements (especially in terms of education and occupation), changes and modifications to their goals, resettlement challenges, social barriers, and how these factors have influenced their long-term adjustment in the U.S. This study's findings reveal the prevalence of an other-oriented/beyond-the-self (BTS) purpose among the South Sudanese URMs that helped them to overcome resettlement challenges and promote positive adjustment and psychological wellbeing. The findings also describe how their process of purpose development was closely related to and influenced by their four-dimensional acculturation experiences, with identity reformation and integration providing insights into their educational and occupational achievements and general life satisfaction as the determinants of long-term adjustment. In the following complementary quantitative study, a questionnaire was developed using existing scales and measurements to evaluate the levels of general purpose and BTS purpose, variables of resettlement challenges such as emotional strain and perceived discrimination, and key adjustment outcomes such as educational and occupational attainment. As a result of multiple regression analyses, the moderation effect of prosocial purpose was found to be statistically significant in promoting better adjustment outcomes by buffering the negative impact of resettlement challenges.

  Keywords = {\#duplicate-citation-key, P-280},
  Abstract = {This investigation sought to examine the role of acculturation and generational theory and influenced social and cultural practices among Saudi Arabian students who were currently residing in the United States. Theoretically, it sought to answers questions that help determine how Americanization---the adaptation and acculturation of a visiting culture to absorb and incorporate the host culture into their lives, customs, and social practices, and in this case savings behavior. A comprehensive model was developed to test the idea that living in America can and does have an influence on social and cultural practices. What was of interest in this study was whether or not these same influences could have an impact on particular cultural practices, in this case how people felt about, reacted to, and addressed the concept of savings--the stockpiling of funds for future needs. Information was gathered from a sample of over 500 Saudi Arabian students living in the United States. The model as structured was tested using SEM analytic techniques in an effort to fully explore and expose the nuanced and subtle differences among the respondents. The concept of savings behavior being influenced by Americanization as originally discussed was not substantiated by the model even though some of the indicators were within expected parameters (chi2 = 217.241, p {\textless} .001; CFI = 0.839, TLI = 0.732, RMSEA = 0.034). Despite the general problems the overall model revealed that at least 17\% of what was termed as savings behavior could be explained by the model. The study still retained its value because it has made inroads into an area that has not yet been explored. Future investigations should take care to find better ways to incorporate some of the cultural elements of savings behavior directly into the instrument based on the perspective of their test populations rather than assume value in and use instruments tested and normed with US samples.

The study employed a cross-sectional design and a convenience sampling method. Data were collected from 75 Mexican immigrant adult education students in the city of Chicago. Instruments used to collect data were a demographic form, Spiritual Well-Being Scale, Migratory Grief and Loss Questionnaire, and the Stephenson Multigroup Acculturation Scale. All instruments were translated into Spanish, the native language of the participants. Multiple regression analysis was used to test the moderator effects of existential well-being and religious well-being, the two subscales of the Spiritual Well-Being Scale. Existential well-being and religious well-being failed to show a moderator effect. A moderate positive correlation was found between migratory grief and acculturation-degree of immersion in the ethnic society. This study also found a moderate negative correlation between self-perceived adaptation and acculturation-degree of immersion in the dominant society. This study extends current knowledge on the spiritual well-being of Mexican immigrants.}

  Abstract = {This causal-comparative study examined if Iranian or Iranian Americans of either Islamic or Jewish religious self-identifications significantly differ in their reported level of cultural adaptation as evidenced by level of acculturation and the degree of acculturative stress, after controlling for the influence of years of residence in the United States. To conduct this investigation, 107 participants were administered the Cultural Lifestyle Inventory (Mendoza, 1989), which was adapted for use with members of the Iranian culture (Ghaffarian, 1998), and the Kerendi-Kadkhoda Acculturative Stress Scale (Kerendi, 1998). The results of the MANCOVA indicate that religious identification does significantly influence cultural adaptation. Participants who self-identified as Islamic reported significantly higher Iranian orientation of acculturation while participants who self-identified as Jewish reported significantly higher U.S. orientation of acculturation. Furthermore, participants who self-identified as Islamic reported significantly higher resistance based acculturative stress when compared to their Jewish counterparts, although no significant difference was found for immersion based acculturative stress. This study revealed the relevance of considering intra-cultural differences such as religious identification among Iranian immigrants and Iranian Americans.}

  Abstract = {Acculturation of the Iranian American immigrants and its influence on dietary patterns of Iranian was investigated. Effect of exposure to the U.S. culture and Western diets and prevalence of chronic diseases were examined. Acculturation was measured using the Iranian Acculturation Scale, and total acculturation score is calculated. Dietary patterns were measured using the Block Brief Food Questionnaire (BFQ), total foods and beverages consumed over the past year, as specified in BBFQ, were studied. Two hundred seven (N = 207) Iranian American immigrants completed the acculturation, food frequency and socio-demographic questionnaires. All participants were born in Iran, were 18 years of age or older and had lived more than one year in the U.S. About 37.5\% of participants had acculturation scores indicating Iranian values; the majority (62.5\%) had either adapted American values (26.5\%) or had combined some American values (36\%). Results indicate age at arrival, length of stay, English fluency, education and income are major factors determining level of acculturation, dietary patterns and prevalence of chronic diseases among Iranian American immigrants. Consumption of Western diet and level of acculturation was less among participants who lived longer ({\textgreater} 10 years) in the U.S. and were older when they arrived to the US. The rate of family history of diabetes among participants was 39.1\%., though 9\% had pre-diabetes and 4\% reported being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. A majority of the participants (87\%) reported no secondary health concerns related to dietary intake. As Iranian American immigrants grow older their consumption of red meats, fast foods, soft drinks, potatoes, salty snacks, refined grains and sweets were significantly decreased and they consumed more vegetables. Given growing Iranian immigrants in U.S., a deep understanding of factors influencing dietary patterns of Iranian immigrates is necessary. Our study with small sample size (207) has several limitations, which should be rectified by future researchers. Therefore, conclusion about association between level of acculturation, dietary patterns and prevalence of chronic diseases among participants is limited. New Iranian immigrants especially those with school-aged children may become more aware of consumption of Western diet and ill effects on their overall wellbeing.

Academic self-efficacy, acculturation, family obligation, and perceived social support have been identified as being relevant to college students' achievement motivation. However, limited research is available regarding the potential impact of these factors on the achievement motivation of undocumented college students (i.e., DREAMers), which is a population with poor college enrollment and retention rates. The primary purpose of this study was to explore the extent to which these factors influenced achievement motivation in documented and undocumented Latinx college students. Participants who identified as documented Latinx college students (N = 160) or DREAMers (N = 84) completed an online survey consisting of a demographic questionnaire, Academic Motivation Scale - College Version, Academic Self-Efficacy Subscale, Short Acculturation Scale for Hispanics, Family Obligation Scale, and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. A series of multiple regression analyses indicated that social support was a significant predictor of extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, and family obligation was a significant predictor of intrinsic motivation in documented students. Acculturation and academic self-efficacy were significant predictors of DREAMers' intrinsic motivation and amotivation, respectively. The implications and limitations of these findings are discussed.

  Abstract = {Germany has a history of more than forty years of large-scale, primarily economic migration. At present, Germany is close to the middle on the diversity and integration indexes, and below the middle on the policy index. Because of the recent arrival of around one million refugees from West Asia, Germany is an important country to examine and understand views about intercultural relations during this period of transition. The study in this chapter investigates intercultural relations in Germany with two samples from German participants and three other samples with diverse migration backgrounds. Furthermore, we examine how the feelings of well-being of migrants and the majority are related to their feelings of security and intergroup contact. The multiculturalism hypothesis proposes that confidence in one's own identity and place in society leads to the acceptance of culturally different others. In this study, we operationalize confidence in one's own identity and place in society as feeling secure in Germany. For the contact hypothesis, we assess the conditions under which contact is associated with higher levels of acceptance and positive out-group attitudes among minority members. We operationalize "contact" through the degree of fulfillment of the need to feel connected to Germans. The integration hypothesis proposes that a double engagement with both the culture of origin and the majority society should positively affect the well-being of migrants. We empirically evaluate this hypothesis by assessing two outcomes in relation to the integration strategy: self-esteem and acculturation pursuit.

Data was gathered via a survey administered to 265 respondents with Chinese origin. Results indicate that exposure to mainstream newspapers is only positively related to one indicator of subjective reality, namely, outgroup perception whereas exposure to ethnic newspapers was not significantly related to any of the indicators of subjective reality. Acculturation attitudes, on the other hand, are more closely related to group perception and contact but not closely associated with exposure to print media. These findings have again challenged the "direct effect" assumption of cultivation theory, paved the ground for combining mediated communication variables with interpersonal communication variables in acculturation research and suggested policy implications for interethnic coexistence. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract = {To understand infant-feeding patterns among Hmong women in St. Paul, MN, this qualitative study used a convenience sample of 21 Hmong mothers who had at least 1 child under the age of 2. Drawing on interviews and questionnaires, this researcher explored (a) how participants described their traditional and American cultural traditions, beliefs, and values, (b) their infant-feeding practices, and (c) how their infant-feeding practices are shaped by adaptations to traditional and American cultures. In this sample, those women who had recently immigrated to the United States were more likely to exclusively use formula. Interviews suggest that American norms of breastfeeding in public, hectic lifestyles in a new country, and lack of cultural knowledge about pumping and storing breast milk influenced 1st- and 1.5-generation participants to exclusively use formula. For 2nd-generation participants, the awkwardness of breastfeeding in public was also cited as an important influence on their decision to use formula. However, quite different from 1st- and 1.5-generation women, 2nd-generation women were more educated and more likely to be employed in less segregated and professional occupations, which exposed them to mothers of different backgrounds who were breastfeeding. This exposure to breastfeeding mothers appeared to influence breastfeeding initiation among 2nd-generation Hmong. This study also found that negative social support from participants’ mothers and mothers-in-law, and positive social support from sisters and sisters-in-law had a strong impact on their infant-feeding decisions. Unlike previous research among Hispanic immigrants, this study revealed that 2nd-generation Hmong immigrants were slightly more likely to include some form of breastfeeding in their infant-feeding method. This study also revealed the importance of social support and the role of the ethnic community in infant-feeding choices. More research is needed, however, to further clarify the relationship between acculturation and social support on breastfeeding initiation and duration among various immigrant populations.}

  Abstract = {Are immigrants in the United States flourishing? What constitute flourishing life among them? This cross-sectional, survey study focused on the role of social capital and acculturation to American society on flourishing among the purposive sample of Japanese immigrants and sojourners living in Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, USA. A total of 380 cases were used to test the hypothetical model of flourishing through structural equation modeling. The majority of the participants was female, in their 30s and 40s, married, fairly high socioeconomic status, and employed. The average lengths of stay in the United States were almost 10 years. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that all the measurement models of flourishing, social capital, and acculturation to American society were reliable and valid with no or a few modifications. The MIMIC model was not included in the final model because of its poor fit (the CFI = .887, the TLI = .830, the RMSEA = .143, χ2 = 122.28, df = 14, p {\textless} .05). The final full structural model yielded an adequate fit (the CFI = .921, the TLI = .906, the RMSEA = .067, χ2 = 345.48, df = 128, p {\textless} .05). Among the sample of Japanese immigrants, demographic variables, including gender, English proficiency, and lengths of stay in the United States were not associated with flourishing. Those with higher social capital were more likely to experience higher acculturation to American society (β = .531, p {\textless} .05) as well as flourishing (β = .494, p {\textless} .05). Higher acculturation to American society predicted higher flourishing (β = .264, p {\textless} .05). The intervening effect of acculturation was found in the relationship between social capital and flourishing. That is, those with higher social capital were more likely to be acculturated to American society, in turn, experienced higher flourishing. The positive approach is useful in understanding immigrant and sojourner adaptation because it takes a person-in-environment perspective that values the effect of social interactions on individuals’ optimal wellbeing. The findings of the study yielded several important implications for social workers working with immigrants and sojourners. Social workers can promote wellbeing by helping them strengthen their existing social ties and to create new relationships that are mediated by both face-to-face and online contacts. Expanded social capital will enhance better acculturation to American society, which encourages better flourishing among Japanese immigrants and sojourners. For ever-growing global society, it is of great importance to examine immigration as positive experiences for both immigrants and the nation that welcomes them.

  Abstract = {Many view immigration as a stressful situation due to major environmental and psychosocial adjustment. The immigration adjustment process is even more problematic for immigrant Asian Indian women who carry the burden of transmitting familial and cultural values to their children, especially their daughters. Prior research suggested that the attachment patterns or attachment styles influence the way immigrants cope with the process of immigration. This study investigated the effects of attachment patterns on the level of acculturation and attachment relationship among immigrant Asian Indian mothers and their U.S.-raised daughters. In this study, Asian Indian mothers and their daughters responded to the Suinn-Lew Acculturation Scale (SL-ASIA, 1992) modified for the Asian Indian population, Relationship Questionnaire (RQ, Bartholomew \& Horowitz, 1991), Relationship Scale Questionnaire (RSQ, Griffin \& Bartholomew, 1994), Intimacy Scale (Walker \& Thompson, 1983), Conflict Scale (Boyd, 1987), and a background information questionnaire. Statistically significant correlations were found between intergenerational transmission of attachment patterns among mothers and daughters and their levels of intimacy and conflict with each other. Nearly two thirds of secure mothers had secure daughters. Similarly, approximately two thirds of insecure mothers had insecure daughters. Secure mothers and daughters reported more intimacy and less conflict while insecure mothers and daughters reported less intimacy and more conflict in their relationship with each other. No significant statistical correlation was found between attachment patterns and levels of acculturation of either mothers or daughters. However, several socio-demographic variables were found to be significantly correlated to attachment patterns and acculturation levels of both mothers and daughters.

  Abstract = {Background: Acculturation is a long-term, multi-dimensional process occurring when subjects of different cultures stay in continuous contact. Previous studies have suggested that elevated rates of depression among different migrant groups might be due to patterns of acculturation and migration related risk factors. This paper focused on prevalence rates of depressive disorders and related risk factors among individuals with Turkish migration backgrounds. Methods: A population-based sample of 662 individuals with Turkish migration backgrounds were interviewed by bilingual interviewers using a standardised diagnostic interview for DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 diagnoses (CIDI DIA-X Version 2.8). Associations between 12-month prevalence rates of depressive disorders with potential risk factors were assessed, including gender, age, socioeconomic status, acculturation status and migration status. Results: 12-month prevalence rates of any depressive disorder were 29.0\%, 14.4\% of major depressive disorder (MDD) and 14.7\% of dysthymia. Older age and low socioeconomic status were most consistently related to higher risks of depressive disorders. Acculturation status showed associations with subtypes of depressive disorder. Associations differed between men and women. Symptom severity of MDD was linked to gender, with females being more affected by severe symptoms. Conclusion: The prevalence of depressive disorders is high in individuals with Turkish migration backgrounds, which can be partly explained by older age, low socioeconomic status and acculturation pressures. Only a limited number of risk factors were assessed. Acculturation in particular is a complex process which might not be sufficiently represented by the applied measures. Further risk factors have to be identified in representative samples of this migrant group. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)}

Factor analyses with principal axis factoring extractions and direct oblimin rotations were used to identify the underlying structure of ARSAA-II. Factor analysis confirmed the underlying structure of ARSAA-II and produced two interpretable factors labeled as ‘Attraction to American Culture’ (AAmC) and ‘Attraction to Arabic Culture’ (AArC). The Cronbach’s alphas of AAmC and AArC were.89 and.85 respectively. Findings support ARSAA-II A \& E to assess acculturation among Arab Americans.

Methods: Participants, 603 Mexican-American men and 893 women aged 50 and older who had not been diagnosed with colon cancer, reported CRC screening behavior on the 2005 California Health Interview Survey. A 7-item acculturation index (English language use/proficiency, nativity, citizenship, and years living in the U.S.) was developed. A logistic regression model predicted CRC screening as a function of acculturation. Results: Higher acculturated Mexican- Americans were 3–4 times more likely to have had both fecal occult blood test and endoscopic CRC screening. Lower acculturated Mexican men and women were twice as likely to not have any CRC screening. Discussion: Colorectal screening is effective in preventing cancer; educational and outreach efforts and efforts to decrease language barriers among lower-acculturated Mexican- Americans should be intensified.

This cross-sectional pilot study compared women living in Chavinda, Michoacán (n = 102) to women who had migrated from Mexico to Madera, California (n = 93). The interview gathered information on acculturation and risk behaviors including smoking, alcohol use and number of sexual partners. The results suggest that more acculturated women living in the US are more likely to consume alcohol. US residence and higher acculturation level was marginally associated with having more than one sexual partner. There were no differences between odds of smoking among Chavinda and Madera women. While results with acculturation are not consistently significant due to small sample sizes, the results are suggestive that acculturation among immigrant Hispanic women in the US may be associated with adverse health behaviors, and selective migration seems less likely to account for these differences. © 2010 The Author(s).},

For this purpose, we have created the Physical Activity and Sport Acculturation Index (PASAI), following the main dimensions that define the social integration of immigrants in the field of physical activity and sport (PAS): mixed relationships, cultural references, engagement and transnationality. A survey was administered to 221 immigrant students, aged 14 to 18 years, enrolled in secondary schools. The results show that the levels of participation in physical activity and sport in young immigrants were lower than the Spanish. Moreover, generation and origin emerged as important elements in the process of sport acculturation; young African—Sub Saharan and Maghrebi—immigrants obtained a lower degree of sports acculturation; and the first generation students attained a lower level of sports acculturation than those of the 1.5 and second generations. In conclusion, schools should review their educational activities if they want to eliminate inequalities in the acculturation process of students from different origins.

  Abstract = {This article uses 20 years of survey data from the Mexican Migration Project to describe how the experiences of Mexico-U.S. migrants have changed over time. I use survey questions about migrants’ experiences on their last U.S. trip to develop composite indices of six integration domains, and then estimate random intercept linear regression models with individual-, family-, and community-level characteristics to explain variations in Mexican migrant integration. I find that, over time, Mexican migrant linguistic and social integration has steadily increased, whereas integration in other family and economic domains changed little or not at all. Results from the multivariate models show the importance of human capital to integration across the multiple domains. Higher education, more time spent in the country of destination, and being male are all strongly associated with higher levels of integration. I also find evidence that both family and community migration networks facilitate integration.}

They are considered one of the 'newer' Asian immigrant groups, tend to be less affluent compared with their East and South Asian counterparts, and are steadily growing in number. Unfortunately, few studies have been conducted specifically about Southeast Asian immigrants. The lack of studies, coupled with the community’s growing mental health issues, suggests the need for increased research on this population. This study contributes to the literature by examining the extent to which identification with Vietnamese or Cambodian culture, peer relationships, and coping behaviors affect substance use among Cambodian and Vietnamese immigrant youth. A sample of 102 participants, age 12 to 18 years, completed self-report measures regarding these variables. Results indicate that identification with one’s culture of origin and coping behaviors moderate the relationship between deviant peer association and substance use.

Data was obtained via a survey administered to 133 Asian immigrants and 108 Anglo-Australians, a total of 241 respondents. Results revealed discordance in attitudes towards multiculturalism between Asians and Australians, with Asians rating it higher as a benefit and lower as a threat as compared to Australians. While higher ratings on multiculturalism as a threat tended to be positively related to separation strategy, this linear association did not hold true for the minority group (Asians). For Asian respondents, those who perceived a moderate threat in multiculturalism were more likely supporters for separation. Our findings supported the assumption that multiculturalism is viewed as differentially beneficial for minority and majority groups. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

  Abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Self-reported life satisfaction has been used to evaluate the immigrants’ integration within their country of residence, as it is commonly employed to estimate the perceived quality of life within a country or a specific social group. Results show that self-reported life satisfaction strongly depends on immigrants’ demographic characteristics and human capital factors, such as age, marital status, current economic situation and perceived financial well-being. ‘Immigration’ variables also play a role in determining life satisfaction, thus proving that conditions at both the origin and destination are important in determining immigrants’ self-reported life satisfaction. In particular, legal status and country of residence play a significant role in defining immigrants’ life satisfaction, thus demonstrating that the rights, resources and restrictions immigrants find within their country of residence determine their subjective experience of integration.}

  Abstract = {Purpose The objectives of this study are: to gain a better understanding of the modes of acculturation of West African immigrants in Canada; to relate these modes of acculturation to consumers' perceived likelihood of successful complaint and complaining behavior; and to compare consumers' complaint attitudes and behavior in their home countries (i.e. original countries) and the host country (Canada). Design/methodology/approach An empirical study is conducted among a sample of 218 immigrants from several West African countries now living in Canada. ANOVA and paired samples ttests were used to test the research hypotheses. Findings The results show that the majority of the surveyed West African immigrants fall into one of two acculturation groups: integrated or separated. Although there are no significant differences between these two groups in terms of their perception that a consumer complaint is more likely to be successful in Canada than in their home countries, there are significant differences in their complaining behaviors in Canada and at home. Research limitations/implications Marketers should be aware that not all immigrants are the same and that market segmentation based on the degree of immigrants' acculturation might lead to a sound marketing strategy. Practical implications Caution should be exercised in generalizing the research results to the entire population of West African immigrants in Canada. Originality/value Most previous studies of the consumption behavior of immigrants have examined their perceptions and behavior mainly in the context of the host country, while overlooking their perceptions and behavior in their home countries. The present study has addressed this gap in the literature by investigating the perceptions and behavior of West African immigrants to Canada in both contexts. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited}

  Abstract = {Marginalization is often presented as the strategy associated with the worst adjustment for immigrants. This study identifies a critical variable that buffers marginal immigrants from the negative effects of marginalization on adjustment: The need for uniqueness. In three studies, we surveyed immigrants recruited on university campuses (n = 119, n = 116) and in the field (n = 61). Among marginal immigrants, a higher need for uniqueness predicted higher self-esteem (Study 1), affect (Study 2), and life satisfaction (Study 3), and marginally higher happiness (Study 2) and self-esteem (Study 3). No relationship between the need for uniqueness and adjustment was found among non-marginal immigrants. The adaptive value of the need for uniqueness for marginal immigrants is discussed.},

  Year = {2011},
  Keywords = {\#duplicate-citation-key, P-774},
  Abstract = {Policymakers, practitioners, and educators frequently group Latina/o immigrant adolescents within a single homogenous category, thus creating a problem in understanding their diverse experiences. To explore these diverse Latina/o adolescent experiences this dissertation cross-culturally compares patterns of ethnic identity and acculturation across a group of Indigenous (Yucatec Maya) immigrant Latino/a adolescents in the U.S. with Yucatec Maya adolescents residing in Mexico and with non-Indigenous immigrant Latina/o adolescents in the U.S.How do ethnic identity, acculturation levels, perceived discrimination, and sense of school belonging compare across Yucatec Maya adolescents in the U.S., non-Yucatec Maya Latina/o adolescents in the U.S., and Yucatec Maya adolescents still in Mexico? What roles do individual factors such as gender, language, generation level, and external factors such as family, cultural practices, ethnic community networks, and peer relationships take in the adolescents' lives in the U.S. and in Yucatan? The study draws on ethnic identity and acculturation frameworks as they relate to perceived discrimination (the study of how the person targeted by discrimination reacts and interprets these acts) and to the adolescents' feelings of belonging at school. The participants included 65 Latina/o non-Yucatec Maya heritage adolescents living in the Los Angeles, California area, 66 Mexican Maya heritage immigrant adolescents living in San Francisco, California or the Los Angeles, California area, and 70 Mexican Maya heritage adolescents living in Yucatan, Mexico. All 201 adolescents took a survey incorporating measures of ethnic identity, acculturation, perceived discrimination, and school belonging. Thirty-eight of the adolescents participated in semi-structured interviews that explored attitudes toward school, culture, discrimination, family, community, and peers influencing the adolescents.Quantitative findings expose the intra-group differences across Yucatec Maya and non-Yucatec Maya Latina/os adolescents and the discrimination faced by the growing population of Yucatec Maya adolescents within the Latino/a immigrant groups. Language, gender, and generation all play roles in the amount of peer and adult perceived discrimination experienced and the distress caused by perceived discrimination across Indigenous and non-Indigenous adolescents. The quantitative findings ultimately show that Indigenous adolescents have different psychological and cultural experiences when compared to non-Indigenous Latina/o adolescents. Being Yucatec Maya, first generation, male, and/or knowledgeable of Maya would put the adolescent at a higher risk of experiencing more perceived discrimination acts and distress. More perceived discrimination from adults also relates to adolescents in the U.S. (both Yucatec Maya and non-Yucatec Maya) resulting in lower levels of school belonging.The qualitative findings across the non-Yucatec Maya adolescents, Yucatec Maya adolescents in the U.S., and Yucatec Maya adolescents in Mexico reveal an in depth look at multiple perspectives surrounding cultural and ethnic identity, cultural practices, American culture, discrimination, school, family, and peers. Specifically for the Yucatec Maya adolescents, the interviews provided a lens into their sentiments about the Maya culture and preserving the culture for future generations. The interviews reflect the agency, reclamation of culture, and lived experiences that make up the Indigenous and non-Indigenous adolescents of this study. The study exposes the Yucatec Maya youth's resilient Indigenous identity that emerges regardless of the discrimination they face from non-Latina/o/non-Mexican groups as well as from their own Latina/o/Mexican communities. This understanding is needed to provide more comprehensive resources and services to these adolescents. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)}

In this article, the author adopts Bourdieu's perspective that accumulation and conversion of forms of capital is only possible through practice in a social field; therefore, the author puts forward the idea that language capital acquisition occurs through active participation in the host society. By employing data from the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Canada, this article demonstrates the variability in premigration language capital among recent adult immigrants to Canada and the effect of premigration language capital and individual factors on language proficiency gains over 4 years of arrival. The study examines opportunities for language acquisition through formal and informal learning and demonstrates that vulnerable groups, such as women, older immigrants, and less educated immigrants who have less language capital at arrival, report also limited access to learning opportunities. © 2012 American Association for Adult and Continuing Education.}

Jewish identity was found to be the most salient of the three but predicted only one of the aspects of psychological adjustment - alienation. Findings underscore the need for the acculturation field to incorporate the possibility of more than two cultures into the explanatory framework and to examine the extent to which ethnocultural identities are contextually bound. © 2005 Sage Publications.}

Acculturation takes place when a person changes from ethnic to American, from military to civilian life, from one region of the country to another, from rural to urban living, or from one social class to another. This study is concerned primarily with acculturation of immigrants or their children and grandchildren. Observation was made that various nationalities presented different problems of acculturation. Psychotherapy has to work out the problems of motivation for culture change, and touch upon early childhood identifications. Eventually a belated identification can be accomplished through successful identification with the psychotherapist, which in turn will make it possible for the individual to accept the majority of the new values.

  Abstract = {One of the most visible and universal ways that people express themselves is through their clothes. Clothing communicates information about an individual’s personality, group membership, and even context of social situations. Research suggests that clothing is part of a dynamic social process, linked to ethnic identity, religious identity, and self-esteem. However, psychological research examining immigrants’ clothing choices remains scant. The present studies examine links between clothing preference, acculturation strategies and cultural identity among immigrants. Study 1 explored meanings and symbolism of Canadian/Western versus ethnic clothing for Chinese, Korean, and Indian immigrants (N = 15) through qualitative methodology. Participants described wearing ethnic clothing to express pride in and identification with heritage culture, while wearing Canadian clothing for practicality and to match social norms. Studies 2 and 3 surveyed Chinese, Indian, and European Canadians. Study 2 (N = 324) examined relations between ethnic identity and attitudes toward Canadian and ethnic clothing. Study 3 (N = 196) examined attitudes toward clothing (formal vs. casual) in different contexts (among peers of same or different ethnic background). Both immigrant groups reported being more likely to wear ethnic clothing among members of the same ethnicity but were otherwise more likely to wear Canadian clothing. Once social context was accounted for, there was a relation between ethnic identity and likelihood of wearing ethnic clothing. This effect was found for Chinese Canadians. Overall, our findings suggest that immigrants’ clothing choices are influenced by who they interact with. Immigrants choose clothing as a dimension to manifest their values and represent their adaptation to their society of settlement. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)}

Further guided by the theory of intergroup anxiety, this study also adopted a context-specific approach to distinguish between participants’ experience of social anxiety when interacting with European Americans versus with other Chinese in the United States. This quantitative and ex post facto study used a convenience sample of 140 first-generation Chinese immigrants. Participants were recruited through e-mails from different university and community groups across the United States. The sample includes 55 men and 82 women (3 did not specify) with an average age of 36 years old. Results showed that more social anxiety was reported in the European American context than in the Chinese ethnic context. The full models accounted for almost half the variance in anxiety in each context. Although personality accounted for the most variance, the cultural variables and discrimination contributed 14\% of the unique variance in the European American context. Notably, low acculturation, high neuroticism, and low extraversion were unique contributors to social anxiety with European Americans, whereas in the Chinese ethnic context only low extraversion was a unique contributor; more discrimination was uniquely significant in both contexts. The findings suggest a need to contextualize the research and clinical assessment of social anxiety, and have implications for culturally sensitive counseling with immigrants.

  Abstract = {Using latent class analysis, we previously identified three acculturation strategies employed by South Asian immigrants in the US. Members of the Separation class showed a preference for South Asian culture over US culture, while members of the Assimilation class showed a preference for US culture, and those in the Integration class showed a similar preference for South Asian and US cultures. The purpose of this study was to examine associations between these acculturation strategies and symptoms of depression, a common yet underdiagnosed and undertreated mental disorder. We used data from the Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America (MASALA) study (n = 856). Data were collected between October 2010 and March 2013 in the San Francisco Bay Area and Chicago. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the CES-D Scale. Applying a simple new method to account for uncertainty in class assignment when modeling latent classes as an exposure, we found that respondents in the Separation class had more depressive symptoms than those in the Integration class, but only after taking into account self-reported social support (b = 0.11; p = 0.05). There were no differences in depressive symptoms among those in the Assimilation class vs. those in the Integration class (b = −0.06; p = 0.41). Social support may protect against elevated symptoms of depression in South Asian immigrants with lower levels of integration into US culture.},

Surveys were administered to 164 adult women. Analyses were conducted along socio-demographic variables of ethnicity, geographic residence, age, and length of time in the United States through t tests and one-way analysis of variance. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted on the modified BIQ. Exploratory factor analyses yielded five subscales: “Speak Native Language”, “Speak English Language”, “Enjoy Native Activities”, “Enjoy American Activities”, and “Desired Ideal Culture”. The subscales of the modified BIQ possessed Cronbach’s α ranging from 0.68 to 0.92, suggestive that all subscales had acceptable to excellent internal consistency.

Participants completed a questionnaire similar to that used by Navas et al., reworked for a different context (Italian) and age (adolescents) and distributed in two versions: for hosts and for migrants. Differences both at an intergroup level of analysis (between hosts and migrants points of view) and at an intraindividual one (between acculturation strategies and attitudes) were explored referring to three central (family, religious and way of thinking) and three peripheral (school, economic habits and friendships/relationships) domains of acculturation. For strategies, results about hosts' perspective showed a perception of migrants as separated, more in the central domain than in the peripheral one. This perception does not coincide with the choice of migrants who declared to use integration strategy in both kinds of life domains. Also for attitudes results demonstrated high discordances, while migrants reported that they would prefer integration into the peripheral domain and separation into the central one, hosts reported that they would prefer migrants adopted assimilation, regardless of esteemed domains. These discordances at intergroup as well as at intrapersonal level of analysis, predict conflictual intercultural relations more in central than in peripheral domains. Data also showed that for host adolescent types of intercultural relations empirically predicted attitudes toward the immigrants. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.}

  Abstract = {Objective: Studies have shown that immigrants' acculturation is associated with numerous unhealthy behaviours. Yet, the role of environmental factors in modifying the effect of acculturation on health behaviours has received little attention. This study aims to create a more nuanced understanding of the health effects of acculturation by examining how neighbourhood immigrant composition modifies the association between individuals' eating patterns and acculturation. Methods: Cross-sectional Data from Los Angeles County Health Survey 2007 adult sample were linked to data on retail food establishments and US Census 2000 neighbourhood characteristics. Acculturation was measured by language spoken at home and years stayed in the US. Eating fast food more than once per week and eating zero serving of fruit or vegetables during the previous day were used as proxy indicators for unhealthy dietary behaviour. Multilevel logistic regression models were performed in the full sample and in the sample with only Latino adults. Results: Immigrants' lack of acculturation and living in a neighbourhood with a high percentage immigrants were associated with healthier dietary behaviour. We also identified that lack of acculturation conveyed a significantly stronger protective effect on regular fast-food consumption for immigrants living in neighbourhoods with higher percentage immigrants (OR: 0.34, 95\% CI: 0.12 to 0.93). Conclusions: Among immigrants in Los Angeles County, living in a neighbourhood with a high density of other immigrants attenuates the negative effects of acculturation on healthy eating behaviours. Healthy eating promotion efforts should build on this protective effect in outreach to acculturating immigrant communities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

  Abstract = {This study examined the similarity of immigrant and minority adolescents' cultural values to those shared by the majority of the country they live in, i.e. the cultural value fit. It was hypothesized that immigrant and minority individuals who show different acculturation orientations differ in their cultural value fit. The highest cultural value fit was expected for individuals pursuing an assimilation orientation, the lowest fit for individuals with a separation orientation. Individuals with a marginalization or integration orientation were expected to take a mid position. Survey data were used from immigrant and minority adolescents: Immigrants from countries of the Former Soviet Union (FSU) to Germany (N= 862) and Israel (N= 435), immigrants from Turkey to Germany (N= 664), and members of the Arab minority in Israel (N= 488). Results of Analyses of Variance showed similar patterns in all four samples in line with the hypothesis but pointed also to stronger effects among FSU immigrants as opposed to Turkish immigrants and Arab Israelis. Results are discussed with regard to the general contribution of the cultural fit research for the acculturation research and with regard to the role of cultural value fit for psychological well-being of immigrants and minority members. The stronger effects found among the FSU samples as opposed to the Turkish respectively Arab Israeli sample are discussed against the background of the fact that the former are mainly diaspora-immigrants for which cultural value adaptation to the receiving country might be easier compared to the latter. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.}

  Year = {2012},
  Keywords = {\#duplicate-citation-key, P-784},
  Abstract = {Expatriates' degree of adjustment to living and working in a foreign country is well-accepted as an important outcome variable in expatriate management research. However, measures of degree of adjustment do not capture the breadth of strategies expatriates may use to achieve such adjustment, which may be critical for understanding whether expatriates have achieved a healthy and productive orientation to life abroad. Borrowing from research on immigrant populations, this study examines the construct of expatriate acculturation strategies, which characterize expatriates' mode of adjustment along two independent dimensions reflecting maintenance of one's home culture and engagement of the host culture, respectively. One hundred U.S. expatriates were recruited and completed an index of acculturation strategies. In addition, participants completed survey and reaction-time based measures of proposed antecedents, correlates, and outcomes of varying acculturation strategies. Results suggest that expatriates largely pursue either a maintenance-focused or engagement-focused strategy and that acculturation strategies are not redundant with degree of adjustment. Relationships between acculturation strategies and relevant individual differences, characteristics of expatriate positions, and outcomes are discussed.

  Abstract = {Despite generally lower socioeconomic status and worse access to healthcare, Latinos have better overall health outcomes and longer life expectancy than non-Latino Whites. This ‘‘Latino Health Paradox’’ has been partially attributed to healthier cardiovascular (CV) behaviors among Latinos. However, as Latinos become more acculturated, differences in some CV behaviors disappear. This study aimed to explore how associations between acculturation and CV behaviors among Latinos vary by country of origin. Combined weighted data from the 2005 and 2007 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) were used to investigate associations between acculturation level and CV behaviors among Latinos by country of origin. Among all Latinos, increased acculturation was associated with more smoking, increased leisure-time physical activity, and greater consumption of fast foods, but no change in fruit/vegetable and less soda intake. These trends varied, however, by Latino sub-groups from different countries of origin. Country of origin appears to impact associations between acculturation and CV behaviors among Latinos in complex ways. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

  Abstract = {The acculturation process is an important factor in the experience of all immigrants. Although previous studies have indicated the challenges faced by Korean immigrants, little attention has been paid to Korean women’s immigration experiences. A focused ethnography was used to examine midlife and older Korean immigrant women’s experiences following their immigration to Canada. Fifteen women were interviewed in a city in Western Canada. The findings showed that in coming to Canada, women focused on caring for their children and often sacrificed their personal dreams. They had to be employed to support their families, and received support from family and government. Women participated regularly in a Korean Church and drew on their Christian faith to ease their adjustment. They retained hopes for the future including good health and a better life for their children. Most women indicated that it was difficult to integrate into Canadian society but they never gave up on their adjustment to a new culture. In this manuscript, the adjustment experience of the immigrant women is discussed in the context of an acculturation framework. The findings will enhance health professionals’ awareness of adjustment patterns and associated challenges to Korean immigrant women’s quality of life.

A validated Asian Indian Dietary Acculturation Measure (AIDAM) and the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) were completed by 153 Asian Indians in the U.S. via a cross-sectional web-survey. Correlations and relative risk ratios were used to examine the association between AIDAM and FINDRISC. A significantly larger proportion of Non-Indian Oriented participants (44.7 \%) had higher FINDRISC scores (scores 7–26) compared to the Asian Indian Oriented group (27.9 \%) (p = .024), and also had increased relative predictive risk for type 2 diabetes (relative risk ratio = 1.6). A positive association between dietary acculturation and diabetes risk was evident in our sample, which highlights the importance of assessing dietary acculturation in non-native groups when investigating type 2 diabetes risk factors.

  Abstract = {International migration research has focused on the immigrants' mental and physical health issues with little attention paid to factors that facilitate adjustment. Recently cross-cultural researchers have tended to focus on certain psychological and social moderators of stress that differentiate between migrants perceiving higher stress and those remaining relatively unscathed. The present study examined the moderating impact of coping resources (sense of coherence and perceived social support) and coping strategies (problem-focused and emotion-focused) on the relationship between acculturative stress and psychological well-being (positive functioning and negative health outcomes) in stress-coping model. On a final sample of 308 Pakistani immigrants residing in Greater Toronto Area a series of moderated hierarchical regression analyses were performed separately for positive and negative health outcomes. Results indicated that sense of coherence and perceived social support moderated between acculturative stress and positive functioning (self-acceptance, positive relations with others, autonomy, environmental mastery, purpose in life, personal growth), and acculturative stress and negative health outcomes (depression, psychosomatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia, social dysfunction).The current findings have implications for clinicians, researchers, and policy makers for the identification of resource factors that help to understand the resistant power of growing immigrant population to maintain positive functioning. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.}

We asked participants to indicate their current attitude to contact with the receiving society and cultural maintenance and report retrospectively their perceived communication effectiveness at arrival and initial friendships. In line with the predictions, the perceptions of high communication effectiveness at arrival and friendships with members of the receiving society during the initial phase in the new culture were positively correlated with the current attitude to contact with the receiving society assessed 7 years after arrival on average. Also, initial friendships with members of the receiving society were negatively correlated with present cultural maintenance. Moreover, with an increase in NCC, these correlations increased. © 2013 Copyright International Union of Psychology Science.}

Less is known about (a) how acculturation explains differences in family relationships by time in the US, and (b) whether acculturative stressors influence different aspects of immigrants' family relationships. Drawing on an expanded acculturation framework, we explore whether and how attitudinal familism, family contact, and family conflict among immigrant Latina/os vary based on acculturation and acculturative stressors. Method: Using nationally representative data on foreign-born Latina/os (National Latino and Asian American Study; N ± 1,618), ordered logistic and OLS regression analyses examined whether differences in family relationships by time in the US are explained by acculturation factors, and whether acculturative stressors are associated with family relationships when controlling for other important sociodemographic factors. Results: Accounting for acculturation reduces the effect of time in the US on attitudinal familism and family conflict to nonsignificance. Spanish language proficiency and ethnic identity are associated with higher attitudinal familism, while English proficiency is associated with increased family conflict. Additionally, acculturative stressors (involuntary context of exit, hostile context of reception, limited origin country ties) are associated with lower attitudinal familism and higher conflict. Conclusions: Results highlight the importance of (a) examining the ways that migration influences multiple aspects of family relationships, (b) adopting a more comprehensive acculturation framework. Particularly novel are our findings on how acculturative stressors are associated with different family outcomes.}

Methods: A 55-item online survey was assembled by combining three validated instruments for mental health, social support, and acculturation. A link to the survey was e-mailed to training directors of all psychiatric residency and fellowship programs. Directors were requested to forward the survey to their international medical graduate residents for completion between December 2008 and February 2009. Results: One hundred eight international medical graduates from 70 different psychiatric residencies and fellowships completed the entire survey. Respondents' mental health scores were normally distributed. The vast majority scored very high on survey items related to mental health. Acculturation, social support, and postgraduate training year were significant predictors of mental health. Conclusion: Residency training programs should attempt to incorporate measures that would help boost the social support and acculturation of international medical graduates (especially juniorlevel trainees). Acculturation could be improved by language training and courses in American history, culture, and customs, and social support could be expanded by mentoring relationships. © 2011 Academic Psychiatry.}

  Abstract = {Purpose – The paper seeks to determine whether different aspects of migrant pre-migration characteristics (human capital and motivation to migrate) and post-migration behaviour (social integration and career self-management) predict migrants’ post-migration career success. Design/methodology/approach – The research employed a survey questionnaire applied to a sample of 210 migrants who had migrated from Sri Lanka to New Zealand. Twenty-three independent and three dependent (career success – objective and subjective) variables were measured. Sequential multiple regression analysis was applied, mirroring the time-sequenced theory of career development. Findings – Overall, migrants’ occupational status had declined markedly following migration. Variables representing human capital, social integration and career self-management perspectives all contributed substantially to explaining variances in career success, especially objective career success, but motivation to migrate did not. Human capital variables were especially influential in determining pre-migration success, acculturation in the host country and education in the host country in post-migration success. Effects of career self-management behaviours on success were relatively small. Research limitations/implications – A limitation is the cross-sectional design, and possible non-generalisability beyond a single migrant group and host country. Practical implications – The paper discusses implications for migrants, policy makers and future research. Originality/value – Migration, and interest in research on migrants’ careers, is growing. This paper applies a wide range of predictor variables and a logical causal model to predicting migrant career success, indicates significant effects, and points to positive actions that may be taken by government, organisations}

Host countries approach the demands of resettle- ment through varying programs and policies and those differences across countries can profoundly affect the newcomers' experiences. The current study employs quantitative and qualitative methods to examine the individual and contextual factors that influence the resettlement experience for adults from Sudan being resettled in Queensland, Australia. Ninety Sudanese adults were recruited through snowball sampling techniques for the quantitative study, with 10 individuals purposefully selected to complete the semistructured qualitative interview. In the quantitative sample, 25 to 30\% of participants reported significant symptoms of psychological distress and frequent experiences of discrimination, and the majority of participants reported integration (identifying with both Australian and Sudanese cultures) as their method of acculturation. Participants reported feeling initially welcomed into Australia, with positive influences including bonding and bridging capital, which helped them in their adaptation, and negative influences including problems with the resettlement programs and experi- ences of discrimination. The findings underscore the importance of sociopolitical context on refugee experiences of the resettlement process.}

  Abstract = {The Vancouver Index of Acculturation (VIA) is a self-report bidimensional instrument that has been employed in several cultural contexts to assess migrants’ orientations toward mainstream and heritage traditions. Although it has shown good reliability and validity in the past, recent theoretical developments and empirical studies have suggested the VIA might assess more than two dimensions. Moreover, measurement invariance of this instrument across demographic subgroups has never been assessed before. With the aim of evaluating these psychometric issues, exploratory factor analysis and Rasch modeling were conducted on data from two samples of immigrants to Canada (N = 224) and to Italy (N = 266). Results supported the hypothesized two-factor structure, with Rasch modeling showing that items within a subscale differed in terms of “difficulty” in being endorsed, but still belonged to a single factor. Differential item functioning analysis results showed measurement invariance across gender, age and education subgroups. Most results converged across the two samples.}

  Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to elucidate the experience of Bosnian refugees currently living in the United States. Using a phenomenological method, seven adult female Bosnian refugees each participated in an audio-recorded interview lasting from one to two hours. Two major themes emerged from the analyses of the text: belonging and adapting. Belonging included concepts of cultural memory, identity and difference, empathy and reciprocity, and perfection of speech. Adapting focused on coping with transitions, coping with memories of past and attendant losses, coping with accepting a new culture while trying to fit into the new culture, and learning the new language perfectly. Implicit in the refugees' experiences were states of culture shock, loneliness, psychic numbness, grief, nostalgia, and feelings of dejection, humiliation, inferiority, and feeling as if they belonged nowhere. Simultaneously, the refugees reported feelings of relief and safety after leaving behind the threat of death in their old homes, feelings of gratefulness for their new freedom to hope for a better life, and their restored ability to notice beauty, as well as a sense of normalcy in their new lives. Recommendations for nursing research include the need to identify additional factors promoting successful belonging and adapting in refugees. Recommendations for nursing practice include the importance of adopting a perspective that is respectful of the uniqueness of each refugee and the necessity for recognizing the normal processes of refugee adaptation.},

  Abstract = {Examined psychosocial adjustment issues for 2 different groups of Vietnamese refugees who migrated to the United States as children. 358 Vietnamese college students (mean age 21 yrs) from 12 colleges in the Los Angeles area comprised 105 '1st-wave' Ss arriving during the period 1971–75 and 253 '2nd-wave' Ss arriving during the period 1980–85. 85\% of 1st-wave Ss were under 6 yrs of age upon arrival in the US, while only 6\% of 2nd-wave Ss were under 6 at the time of arrival. Administered tests included the Hopkins Symptom Checklist—21 (D. E. Green et al, 1983), a revised version of the Suinn-Lew Self Identity and Acculturation Scale (R. M. Suinn et al, 1987), and the Social Support Questionnaire (I. G. Sarason et al, 1983). Results show that 2nd-wave Ss experienced more psychological distress than did 1st-wave Ss, with 1st-wave Ss experiencing greater acculturation and satisfaction with social support. Females reported greater acculturation than males among 2nd wave Ss only. Findings suggest that mental health professionals need to be aware of intergroup and gender differences in refugee psychosocial adjustment, and understand the importance of pre- and postmmigration issues.}

This population subgroup provides an opportunity for understanding social determinants of oral health in immigrant community. A random sample of 122 Indonesian domestic helpers in Hong Kong completed a questionnaire on their demographic background, social characteristics (competency in local languages, immigration history, living condition, social connections, and leisure activities) and oral health behaviours (knowledge, attitudes, practice and self-efficacy). Their tooth status and periodontal health were assessed. Participants tended to start flossing after settling in Hong Kong. Favourable oral health knowledge was found in more acculturated participants, as indicated by proficiency in local languages and immigration history. Engagement in social and/or religious activities and decent living condition provided by employers were associated with favourable oral health behaviours and/or better oral health. Social determinants explained 13.2 \% of variance in caries severity. Our findings support the significant impact of social circumstances on oral health of domestic workers.}

The sample consisted of 507 Chinese international students studying in the United States. Using psychological distress as an indicator of acculturative adjustment, measured over 4 time points (prearrival, first semester, second semester, and third semester), 4 distinct groups of student adjustment trajectories emerged: (a) a group exhibiting high levels of psychological distress across each time point (consistently distressed; 10\%), (b) a group with decreasing psychological distress scores from Time 1 to Time 2 (relieved; 14\%), (c), those with a sharp peak in psychological distress at Time 2 and Time 3 (culture-shocked; 11\%), and (d) a group with relatively consistent low psychological distress scores (well-adjusted; 65\%). Moreover, significant predictors of a better acculturative adjustment pattern included having higher self-esteem, positive problem-solving appraisal, and lower maladaptive perfectionism prior to the acculturation process. In addition, during the first semester of studying in the United States, having a balanced array of social support and using acceptance, reframing, and striving as coping strategies were associated with a better cross-cultural transition.

The main purpose is to show that the division of the general acculturation attitude into different areas provides more complete information on the acculturation process undergone by immigrants. A new acculturation model, Relative Acculturation Extended Model, (RAEM) has been designed and tested. The model establishes seven areas of acculturation and differentiates among the acculturation strategies adopted (real situation) and the acculturation attitudes preferred (ideal situation) by immigrants. Eight hundred thirteen African immigrants (residents in the south of Spain, Andalusia) who responded to a questionnaire participated in the study. The results show that the general acculturation attitude is one of integration; however, the strategies adopted and the attitudes preferred vary depending on the areas of acculturation considered. © 2006 Sage Publications.}

  Abstract = {It is well documented that the lifestyles of immigrants undergo significant changes during the postarrival period. Although it cannot be argued that leisure behavior is immune to such changes, very little systematic effort has been devoted to exploring this phenomenon. This article attempts to fill this gap by focusing on postimmigration changes in leisure behavior. The empiric analysis utilizes a hybrid approach that combines qualitative data obtained in a series of in-depth interviews and quantitative data from a mail questionnaire survey. Both the interviews and the survey were conducted in 1996 among recent immigrants from Poland residing in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Jackson and Dunn's (1988) theoretic framework is used to investigate the general patterns of postarrival ceasing and starting of participation. Survey respondents are classified into ceasers, adders, replacers, and continuers, and the proportions in each group are analyzed and compared with the published general-population results. Qualitative data then are used to establish the major causes for the observed postarrival changes in leisure-participation patterns. Then, the analysis is extended to account for activity-based variations in ceasing and starting behavior and those based on age at immigration. Interview material is used to isolate major immigration-related factors that encourage immigrants in various age groups to modify their leisure-participation patterns. It is shown that the observed postarrival participation changes can be attributed partially to past latent demand, to the decreased role of certain interpersonal constraints, and to being exposed to new leisure opportunities.}

Using data from 420 residents of the New York City metropolitan area (M age = 71.6, SD = 7.59), health perceptions and depressive symptoms were estimated with hierarchical regression models entered in the order of (1) demographics and acculturation, (2) health-related variables, and (3) perceived neighborhood environment. After controlling for the effects of the individual-level variables, perceived neighborhood environment was found to make a significant contribution to both outcomes. Individuals less satisfied with their overall neighborhood environment were more likely to have negative perceptions of health and depressive symptoms. A strong linkage between perceived neighborhood safety and depressive symptoms was also observed. Findings from the study highlight the importance of subjective evaluations of neighborhood environment and provide implications for health promotion. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.}

Four aspects of smoking attitudes, using the Smoking Attitude Scale, as well as smoking prevalence were measured. Acculturation level and gender were predictors of attitudes toward smoking. In general, the more years living in the US and the greater the use of English, the more negative the attitudinal dimension, in particular the interpersonal relations subscale. Acculturated immigrants were less likely to want to befriend, date or marry smokers. However, acculturated Chinese and Russian females held a more positive smoking attitude and were more likely to smoke, similar to native-born American females. Implications for smoking cessation campaigns suggest that ethnicity, acculturation level and gender factors should inform the design and placement of such programs. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.}

  Abstract = {Background: Challenges of migration, particularly concerning the process of acculturation are associated with an increased risk of mental illness. Vietnamese migrants constitute the largest Southeast Asian migrant group in Germany, yet there is no data on the relationship between the mental health status and acculturation among this population. Aims: Therefore, the present study examines the relationship between two well-established dimensions of acculturation, that is, dominant society immersion (DSI) and ethnic society immersion (ESI), the four resulting acculturation strategies (integration, assimilation, separation and marginalization), and severity of depression. Methods: A sample of N = 113 first-generation Vietnamese outpatients from a psychiatric outpatient clinic for Vietnamese migrants in Germany was studied regarding their self-reported depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)) and acculturation (Stephenson Multigroup Acculturation Scale (SMAS)). Results: Consistent with the hypotheses, patients reported less severe depressive symptoms, when they reported higher orientation toward the German and the Vietnamese society. Moreover, the results showed that integrated patients reported a lower severity of depression compared to marginalized patients, who reported the highest severity of depression. Conclusions: The findings indicate that among a sample of first-generation Vietnamese patients with depression, an orientation to both, the mainstream society and one’s heritage society might serve as a potential resource. The rejection of any orientation to any society is associated with an increased risk for depression.}

Participants were 1,209 Dutch individuals, of whom 693 (57.3\%) were immigrants with a non-Western background. Results showed that an independent self-construal was positively associated with self-awareness and capacity for managing new situations, and was negatively associated with sensitivity to others (which are the three components of autonomy–connectedness). Moreover, an interdependent self-construal was negatively associated with self-awareness and capacity for managing new situations, and was positively associated with sensitivity to others. Importantly, the latter associations were similar for both Dutch natives and immigrants, and the associations between acculturation and autonomy–connectedness were small and nonsignificant. Autonomy–connectedness, after controlling for self-construal and acculturation, explained a large amount of additional variance in anxiety (12.7\%) and depression (14.1), and a medium amount of additional variance in drive for thinness (3.7\%) and bulimia (4.8\%). Autonomy–connectedness, thus, seems to be an important construct for people with a Western background, as well as for immigrants with a non-Western background.}

Data for the study were drawn from a survey of 3,405 male and female migrant laborers from Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos who were working in Thailand in 2010. Regression analysis showed that social integration, participation in an AIDS prevention program, self efficacy, demographic and relationship factors increased AIDS knowledge and condom use with regular and nonregular partners. The social integration of migrants into the Thai community strengthened HIV prevention efforts. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Our studies targeted three distinct types of biculturals: Mainland Chinese immigrants in Hong Kong, Filipino domestic workers (i.e., sojourners) in Hong Kong, and Hong Kong and Mainland Chinese college students. Individual differences in Bicultural Identity Integration (BII.; Benet-Martínez, Leu, Lee, \& Morris, 2002) positively predicted psychological adjustment for all the samples except sojourners even after controlling for the personality traits of neuroticism and self-efficacy. Cultural identification and language abilities also predicted adjustment, although these associations varied across the samples in meaningful ways. We concluded that, in the process of managing multiple cultural environments and group loyalties, bilingual competence, and perceiving one's two cultural identities as integrated are important antecedents of beneficial psychological outcomes. © 2008, Copyright the Authors © 2008, Blackwell Publishing, Inc.},

Aims: To analyze acculturation differences in Spain between first-generation immigrants from two different countries; to analyze the self-reported mental health of these participants; and to evaluate which variables best predict mental health disorders. Method: One hundred and thirty five (135) respondents from Romania and Ecuador responded to a questionnaire analyzing mental health by means of the GHQ-12, coupled with other personal, social and psychosocial acculturation variables. Results: Both cultural groups differed significantly regarding the impact of personal and social variables on their well-being. Nevertheless, mental health distress was not explained by their cultural differences but by gender, gross income and perceived discrimination. Social support offered by those still living at home acted as a buffer. Conclusion: It is important to analyze female migration patterns in order to reduce mental health problems, stress the importance of economic income, and examine how social support offered by those living in one's home culture is an effective buffer against mental distress. © The Author(s), 2011.}

  Abstract = {Objective: Among immigrant chronic dialysis patients, depressive and anxiety symptoms are common. We aimed to examine the association of acculturation, i.e. the adaptation of immigrants to a new cultural context, and depressive and anxiety symptoms in immigrant chronic dialysis patients. Methods: The DIVERS study is a prospective cohort study in five urban dialysis centers in the Netherlands. The association of five aspects of acculturation ("Skills", "Social integration", "Traditions", "Values and norms" and "Loss") and the presence of depressive and anxiety symptoms was determined using linear regression analyses, both univariate and multivariate. Results: A total of 249 immigrant chronic dialysis patients were included in the study. The overall prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 51\% and 47\%, respectively. "Skills" and "Loss" were significantly associated with the presence of depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively ("Skills" β=0.34, CI: 0.11-0.58, and "Loss" β=0.19, CI: 0.01-0.37; "Skills" β=0.49, CI: 0.25-0.73, and "Loss" β=0.33, CI: 0.13-0.53). The associations were comparable after adjustment. No significant associations were found between the other subscales and depressive and anxiety symptoms. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that less skills for living in the Dutch society and more feelings of loss are associated with the presence of both depressive and anxiety symptoms in immigrant chronic dialysis patients.}

  Abstract = {Based on data from a sample of 120 first-generation Mexican immigrant couples collected at the start of the Great Recession in the United States, this study tested an actor-partner interdependence mediation model (APIMeM) in which spouses' perceptions of stress related to economic pressure and cultural adaptation were linked to their own and their partners' reports of marital satisfaction through spouses' depressive symptoms and marital negativity. As hypothesized, results supported indirect links between economic and cultural adaptation stressors and spouses' marital negativity and satisfaction: (1) contextual stress was associated with depressive symptoms, (2) depressive symptoms were positively associated with marital negativity for both husbands and wives and negatively associated with marital satisfaction for wives only, and (3) marital negativity was inversely associated with marital satisfaction for both spouses. Two partner effects emerged: (a) husbands' depressive symptoms were positively associated with wives' reports of marital negativity and (b) husbands' marital negativity was inversely related to wives' marital satisfaction. From these findings, we can infer that the psychological distress that arises for Mexican-origin spouses as they respond to the challenges of making ends meet during difficult economic times while they simultaneously navigate adapting to life in a new country is evidenced in their marital quality. Specifically, this study found that contextual stress external to the marital relationship was transmitted via spouses' psychological distress and negative marital exchanges to spouses' marital satisfaction. Wives' marital satisfaction was shown to be uniquely vulnerable to their own and their husbands' depressive symptoms and marital negativity. © 2014 American Psychological Association.},

The present paper investigates their early-stage acculturation preferences in relation to their perception of majority members' acculturation expectations and to their settlement intentions. 103 Syrian and Iraqi male asylum seekers were recruited during the peak of the 2015 "refugee crisis" in a provisional reception centre and completed a brief questionnaire. Results showed that asylum seekers reported a high willingness to participate in the host society and to adopt the host culture, while maintaining their culture of origin. Moreover, as predicted, asylum seekers' settlement intentions and their perceptions of majority members' acculturation expectations were key predictors of their own acculturation preferences. Implications for integration policies are discussed.}

  Abstract = {This paper addresses some social and psychological issues concerning multiculturalism and immigration in post-Soviet Russia, which is one of the most multicultural societies in the world. The paper begins by describing the current cultural and immigrant diversity in Russia, and then provides a short description of Russian immigrants and the social and psychological problems that immigrants and the larger society face. We present the conceptual framework and findings from empirical studies that examine the reciprocal acculturation and intercultural relations between migrants and members of the larger society. We analyze these studies with respect to their relevance to three hypotheses that have been advanced for examining intercultural relations: the multiculturalism hypothesis; the integration hypothesis; and contact hypothesis. Findings of the studies showed that measures of security, identity, perceived threat/discrimination have a significant relationship with ethnic tolerance, mutual attitudes, acculturation strategies and expectations, and the well-being and life satisfaction of both immigrants and members of the larger society. The results of these studies support all three hypotheses in both groups. The authors concluded that the efforts to improve relations between members of the larger society and immigrants should be directed at enhancing the basic sense of security and at developing programs that increase multicultural attitudes, ethnocultural competence, and tolerance between both groups. © 2013 Hogrefe Publishing.}

  Abstract = {This research aims to identify factors associated with marital instability among Jewish and mixed (Jewish and non-Jewish) couples following immigration from the former Soviet Union. Based on the Strangeness Theory and the Model of Acculturation, we predicted that non- Jewish immigrants would be less well adjusted personally and socially to Israeli society than Jewish immigrants and that endogamous Jewish couples would have better interpersonal congruence than mixed couples in terms of personal and social adjustment. The sample included 92 Jewish couples and 92 ethnically-mixed couples, of which 82 couples (40 Jewish, 42 mixed) divorced or separated after immigration and 102 couples (52 Jewish, 50 ethnically mixed) remained married. Significant differences were found between Jewish and non-Jewish immigrants in personal adjustment, and between endogamous and ethnically-mixed couples in the congruence between spouses in their personal and social adjustment. Marital instability was best explained by interpersonal disparity in cultural identity and in adjustment to life in Israel. The findings expand the knowledge on marital outcomes of immigration, in general, and immigration of mixed marriages, in particular. © 2012 Hogrefe Publishing.}

  Abstract = {A community survey examining the relationship between acculturation and minor psychiatric morbidity among 223 Cambodians living in Dunedin, New Zealand was conducted. Most subjects would like to retain their parent culture but would also like to assimilate into the host culture, indicating a preference for an integrated mode of acculturation. Those who were older, widowed, less educated, had shorter duration of stay in New Zealand, and of lower socioeconomic status, were less acculturated. Overall, the least acculturated were found to have the highest rate of psychiatric morbidity. When age and sex were controlled, the association between acculturation and psychiatric morbidity remained significant only for women aged 31 to 50. Overall, the associations between psychiatric morbidity and acculturation held true for marital status, duration of stay in N.Z., educational level, and socioeconomic status. The relevant conceptual and methodological issues in acculturation studies were discussed. INTRODUCTION}

Results: Results indicated that, among acculturation dimensions, only ethnic identity was significantly related to increased ED whereas ED was associated with increased depression. Moreover, experiences of ED mediated the relationship between ethnic identity and depression. Conclusions: Results may indicate ethnic identity as a risk factor for this group through experiences of discrimination. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed in terms of advancing theory and from a multicultural counseling perspective, respectively.},

The levels of JH active coping in this sample of Korean immigrants appear to be lower than the levels reported in other racial groups. Independent of demographic factors, JH active coping was a significant predictor of higher acculturation status and better psychological health as indicated by lower levels of perceived stress, acculturative stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.}

  Abstract = {Background: Acculturation is the phenomenon that results when a group with one culture comes into continuous contact with a host culture and changes occur in the original culture of either one or both groups. Acculturation has also been linked with stress-related psychological disorder and depression. Aims: This article investigates the acculturation process and the depressive state of foreign immigrants living in the greater Athens area. Methods: All consecutive cases of 157 foreign immigrants who visited a non-governmental organization (NGO) providing consultative services to immigrants were interviewed using a structured questionnaire including the Immigrant Acculturation Scale (IAS) and the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression (CES-D) scale. Results: Factor analysis of IAS yielded a three-factor solution and 17 items with loadings ranging from 0.74 to 0.41. This scale was also tested and proven to be reliable. The main finding is that the higher the acculturation level of the immigrant individual, the lower the CES-D scale score; the fewer the depressive symptoms are self-reported. Length of stay, existence of family in Greece, legal status of residence and employment were also found to have an effect on depressive symptomatology. Conclusion: Acculturation could be seen as a beneficial mechanism protecting the individual to be exposed to stressful non-adaptive behaviour. © 2008 Sage Publications.}

One novel approach in theorizing about wide-ranging psychological implications associated with international migration is to consider its effect in thwarting basic psychological needs. The focus of the current research is on a thwarted sense of control that migrants experience in their adjustment to a host society and its association with heightening pain responses. Among foreign-born residents in Canada (Study 1) and the United States (Study 2), a negative association was found between the participants’ identification with the host culture and their social pain responses. Study 2 supported the role of a diminished sense of control in mediating this association.}

Method: A two-part research strategy using both quantitative and qualitative methods was employed. In the cross-sectional quantitative survey, 113 Chinese respondents completed a questionnaire investigating demographic factors, life experiences associated with migration, proficiency in the English language and mental health status. In the qualitative phase of the research, interviews were conducted with a further 24 immigrants to explore these factors in more depth. Results: In the questionnaire survey, over 60\% of the group reported symptoms of poor mental health. Qualitative research shows that for those who were employed in catering, psychological adjustment was heavily dependent on strong ties with the Chinese community and there was minimal contact with the host society. By contrast, those concerned with professional development experienced conflict as a result of a high perceived need for integration and a recognition of the problems associated with this. Conclusion: The psychological distress experienced by immigrants of Chinese origin continues to be a largely invisible cause for concern. © 2006 Taylor and Francis.}

  Abstract = {Acculturation to the culture of the host society as well as to one’s heritage culture have been shown to impact immigrants’ adjustment during the years following resettlement. While acculturation has been identified as an important factor in adjustment of Vietnamese immigrants (Birman and Tran in Am J Orthopsychiatr 78(1):109–120. doi:10.1037/0002-9432.78.1.109, 2008), no clear pattern of findings has emerged and too few studies have employed an ecological approach. The purpose of this paper is to contextualize the study of acculturation and adjustment by taking an ecological approach to exploring these relationships across several life domains, using a bilinear scale, and examining mediators of these relationships for adult Vietnamese refugees (N = 203) in the United States. We call this approach the Ecological Acculturation Framework (EAF). Results of a structural equation model (SEM) showed that job satisfaction fully mediated the relationship between American acculturation and psychological distress, demonstrating that this relationship was specific to an occupational domain. However, while Vietnamese acculturation predicted co-ethnic social support satisfaction, it did not predict reduced psychological distress. Implications for a life domains approach, including domain specificity, are discussed.}

In this study we explored the expectations that this group of immigrants (N = 271) hoped to fulfill in their adopted society, the extent to which these expectations have been fulfilled, and the impact of fulfilled expectations on psychological adjustment. We found that the degree of fulfilled expectations was significantly associated with better psychological adjustment independent of personality traits, language proficiency, and acculturation. These findings contribute to the literature on cross-cultural adaptation of immigrants from the FSU and highlight the potential importance of expectations for the study of acculturation more generally.}

Nottingham: Nottingham University Press]) and aims to test a multi-dimensional model that combines individual differences, ethnicity dimensions, work characteristics, and perceived job satisfaction/stress as independent variables in the prediction of subjectives reports of health by workers differing in ethnicity. Design: A questionnaire consisting of the following sections was submitted to 900 workers in Southern Italy: for individual and cultural characteristics, coping strategies, personality behaviours, and acculturation strategies; for work characteristics, perceived job demands and job resources/rewards; for appraisals, perceived job stress/satisfaction and racial discrimination; for subjective reports of health, psychological disorders and general health. To test the reliability and construct validity of the extracted factors referred to all dimensions involved in the proposed model and logistic regression analyses to evaluate the main effects of the independent variables on the health outcomes were conducted. Results: Principal component analysis (PCA) yielded seven factors for individual and cultural characteristics (emotional/relational coping, objective coping, Type A behaviour, negative affectivity, social inhibition, affirmation/maintenance culture, and search identity/adoption of the host culture); three factors for work characteristics (work demands, intrinsic/extrinsic rewards, and work resources); three factors for appraisals (perceived job satisfaction, perceived job stress, perceived racial discrimination) and three factors for subjective reports of health (interpersonal disorders, anxious-depressive disorders, and general health). Logistic regression analyses showed main effects of specific individual and cultural differences, work characteristics and perceived job satisfaction/stress on the risk of suffering health problems. Conclusion: The suggested model provides a strong framework that illustrates how psychosocial and individual variables can influence occupational health in multi-cultural workplaces.},

  Abstract = {This study investigated the impact of English health literacy and spoken proficiency and acculturation on preventive dental care use among Somali refugees in Massachusetts. 439 adult Somalis in the US ≤10 years were interviewed. English functional health literacy, dental word recognition, and spoken proficiency were measured using STOFHLA, REALD, and BEST Plus. Logistic regression tested associations of language measures with preventive dental care use. Without controlling for acculturation, participants with higher health literacy were 2.0 times more likely to have had preventive care (P = 0.02). Subjects with higher word recognition were 1.8 times as likely to have had preventive care (P = 0.04). Controlling for acculturation, these were no longer significant, and spoken proficiency was not associated with increased preventive care use. English health literacy and spoken proficiency were not associated with preventive dental care. Other factors, like acculturation, were more predictive of care use than language skills. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.}

Results show that individualism and integrationism are the acculturation orientations preferred by european american, african american, and asian immigrants. Hispanic immigrants also prefer individualism. assimilationism, segregationism, and exclusionism are least endorsed by host community members. Immigrants moderately endorse separatism and weakly endorse assimilationism and marginalization. The social psychological profile of each acculturation orientation revealed that integrationism and individualism was associated with harmonious relational outcomes, whereas assimilationism, segregationism, separatism, and exclusionism were associated with problematic and conflictual intergroup relations.}

  Abstract = {This concurrent embedded mixed-method study examined vocational stressors and coping mechanisms among refugees. Results from a content analysis of open-ended surveys collected from 159 refugees show that the most frequently reported refugee vocational stressor was access and opportunity (31\% of comments made about vocational stressors). This meta-theme encompasses feeling as though past work experience is discounted in the job search, struggles with the job search, and exploitation (e.g., low pay). Other meta-themes included acculturative, discrimination, interpersonal, financial and personal vocational stressors. Qualitative accounts of coping revealed reflection and relaxation (25\%) and problem-solving actions (24\%) as the most commonly reported coping mechanisms. In addition, refugee-specific coping mechanisms (17\%) were frequently reported, and referred to building language skills, engaging in assimilation and multicultural activities, and seeking social support from other refugees. Using the meta-themes that emerged in each vocational stressor category, t-test results show that the experience of discrimination stressors was related to higher levels of self-reported anxiety, depression and sleep disturbances. In addition, the use of avoidance-oriented coping mechanisms was associated with maladaptive outcomes, such as depression, sleep disturbances, and anxiety. Taken together, our results indicate that refugees face many of the vocational stressors typically studied in the occupational health literature (e.g., underemployment). The current study also uncovered unique vocational stressors and coping mechanisms, including evidence for a refugee-specific stigma experienced during the job search process and among refugees who are currently employed. Recommendations for theoretical implications and future research on refugee vocational stressors and coping mechanisms are discussed.}

The major research objective is to clarify whether the desired outcome of integration as described by immigrants from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and natives (Israelis) reflects the same or different models of sociocultural adjustment. Representative samples of immigrants and long-time Israelis completed a 67-item questionnaire where each item represented a criterion of sociocultural adjustment. These items were organized by factor analysis into 12 spheres of sociocultural adjustment (e.g., psychological, economical, educational, etc.). The immigrants preferred the selected acculturation model of sociocultural adjustment: selective adoption of the target culture while maintaining an affinity to the native one. In comparison, the host Israelis favored an integrative model: general (unselective) adoption of the new culture and preservation of an affinity to the native one. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.}

  Abstract = {When acculturation strategies of migrants and acculturation expectations of a host society do not coincide, psychological outcomes for members of the groups in contact can differ significantly. Berry (2013) proposed that intercultural relations can be understood on the basis of three hypotheses: the multiculturalism hypothesis, the integration hypothesis, and the contact hypothesis. Our goal was to test these three hypotheses in Russian majority and Asian minority groups. Migrants from Central Asia (N = 168; 88 ethnic Uzbeks and 80 ethnic Tajiks) and ethnic Russians (N = 158) were surveyed using a self-report questionnaire that included measures developed by the Mutual Intercultural Relations in Plural Societies project. Data processing was carried out using Structural Equation Modeling with the Russians and the migrants separately. We found significant and positive relationships between perceived security and multicultural ideology in both groups. We found a positive relationship between intercultural contacts and the integration strategy among the migrants from Central Asia. Intercultural contacts in the group of Russians was positively related to the expectation of integration and negatively related to the expectation of assimilation. The integration strategy of the migrants was positively related to their self-esteem, while the assimilation strategy was positively related to their sociocultural adaptation and life satisfaction. Among the Russians, the integration expectation promoted their better life satisfaction and self-esteem. The multiculturalism hypothesis was partially supported with both the migrants from Central Asia and the Russians: perceived security promoted an acceptance of multicultural ideology but didn't promote ethnic tolerance. The contact hypothesis was partially supported in both groups: interethnic contacts were positively linked to the integration strategy of the migrants and the integration expectations of the Russians. The integration hypothesis was fully supported in the sample of Russians and partially supported in the sample of migrants. The migrants' adoption of the assimilation strategy promoted their life satisfaction and sociocultural adaptation.}

The roles of two dimensions of acculturation attitudes (toward Own Culture Maintenance and New Culture Acquisition) were also included in the model. The model was tested and validated with three samples of Iranian immigrants living in the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. The results provided support for the multidimensional model. The relations between each variable in the model are discussed with reference to the demographic variation of the samples and the complexity of societal context.}

This questionnaire study was conducted with 199 French host majority respondents and 124 North African immigrants who interacted weekly as undergraduates at a large university in a suburb of Paris. Acculturation orientations strongly endorsed by French undergraduates were integrationism and individualism, while segregationism, assimilationism, and exclusionism were weakly endorsed. Acculturation orientations strongly endorsed by North African undergraduates were integrationism, individualism, and separatism, while the least endorsed orientations were assimilationism and marginalization. Confirming basic premises of the IAM model, results showed that French majority and North African undergraduates who endorsed integrationism and individualism were those who perceived the most harmonious relational outcomes with out-group members. French majority undergraduates who endorsed segregationism/exclusionism and North African undergraduates who endorsed separatism were more likely to perceive problematic/conflictual relations with out-group members. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a sample of 168 exchange students in Moscow from China, North Korea, and countries in sub-Saharan Africa and in the former Soviet Union, the hypothesis was confirmed that a larger perceived cultural distance between mainstream and immigrant culture is associated with less psychological and sociocultural adaptation. The Chinese and North-Korean group reported to experience the largest perceived cultural distance and the lowest levels of adjustment, while the groups from the former USSR and (to a slightly lesser extent) Africa reported the smallest perceived cultural distance and the highest levels of adjustment. The results of a stepwise regression analysis showed that antecedent variables (perceived cultural distance, home and host domain resources, and personality) showed somewhat stronger associations with outcome variables (self-esteem, stress, and behavior in the home and the host domain) than did intervening variables (acculturation attitudes and coping). © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract = {Several studies have suggested that the health of Mexican-Americans is better than expected given their low socioeconomic status. The healthy migrant hypothesis and the acculturation hypothesis, stating that the foreign-born and the less acculturated enjoy better health, have been proposed as possible complementary explanations. However, it is not clear which are the socioeconomic, cultural, and personal characteristics that favor good health and that differentiate foreign-born from US-born and unacculturated from acculturated Mexicans. In this paper, we compare, by nativity and acculturation level, the socioeconomic, cultural, and personal characteristics in a sample of low income mostly female Mexican-origin individuals living in Texas and investigate their contribution to differences in self-reported physical health, mental health, and self-rated health (SRH) status. Using a multistage probability sample, we completed 1745 interviews with Mexican-origin individuals. The survey instrument included the SF-12, demographic and socioeconomic information, and questions on social support, religiosity, fear of victimization, trust, perceived racism, and perceived opportunity. Nativity and use of the Spanish language were combined into a nativity/acculturation variable. We estimated multivariate regressions and ordered logit regressions to investigate the association of health outcomes to nativity/acculturation and socioeconomic, cultural, and personal characteristics. Overall, the distribution of strengths (more social support, trust, perceived personal opportunities and less perceived victimization) reflected a nativity-based income gradient and an education gradient reflecting language use. Health outcomes varied by nativity/acculturation after controlling for socioeconomic, cultural, and personal characteristics. Physical health differed by nativity, supporting the healthy migrant hypothesis, while nativity-based differences in mental health were explained by socioeconomic and personal characteristics. SRH varied by language use, suggesting a culturally conditioned response. The socioeconomic, cultural, and personal factors affected health outcomes differently. These findings suggest a complicated interaction between nativity, acculturation, and economic factors in determining social and personal strengths and their influences on health. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract = {Participation in a new culture and identification with a new culture are important issues faced by millions of immigrants today. Literature describes three possible relations between participation and identification. First, some researchers postulate that they are part of the basic acculturation phenomenon and hence equivalent (Model 1). Others postulate that either identification with a new culture encourages participation in it (Model 2) or participation helps identification with a new culture (Model 3). The goal of the present article was to determine which model best describes the relation between participating in a new culture and identification with it. In Study 1, Latin American immigrants (N = 146) answered a questionnaire, and the fit of each of the three models was compared using path analyses. Results showed that the best fitting model was one where participation in the new culture positively predicted identification with it. These results were confirmed in Study 2, where semistructured interviews of 15 immigrants were analyzed. The two studies in the present article help us understand the relation between participation in the new culture and identification as well as the scope of the changes brought on by immigration.}

  Abstract = {Acculturation is often found to increase substance use among immigrants in the U.S., but such effect may depend on how immigrants are attached to their co-ethnic community. Meanwhile, the high socioeconomic status of some new immigrant groups also challenges the classical assumption that ties to co-ethnic community are associated with deviance. With a sample (n = 960) collected from a population of Chinese students in a large public university in the U.S., we tested how do the interplays between acculturation and co-ethnic ties affect substance use. This study establishes that: (1) different dimensions of acculturation have opposite effects on substance use; (2) acculturative stress does not explain the association between acculturation and substance use; (3) acculturation increases the likelihood of substance use only when one has weak attachment to their co-ethnic community. The findings are consistent for three dependent variables: smoking, drinking, and drunkenness, and for the different constructs of acculturation and co-ethnic ties. Ties to co-ethnic community may provide important social support for immigrants, while acculturation may alleviate the insular subculture that promotes at-risk behaviors. We encourage policy makers to consider the cooperative nature of acculturation and cultural retention for the improvement of health among this growing population.}

Methods Interviews were conducted with 162 firstgeneration Latinas to examine the association of SES and acculturation with intake of omega-3 (n - 3) fatty acids. Each participant provided dietary intake by use of a validated n - 3 food frequency questionnaire administered twice, 4 weeks apart, three 24-h recalls, sociodemographic information and completed the 5-item Short Acculturation Scale. Results Mean intakes of Total n - 3, α-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (g/d) were 1.2 ± 0.7, 1.1 ± 0.6, and 0.1 ± 0.1, respectively. After adjusting for energy intake, education was significantly correlated with EPA + DHA intakes, and acculturation was significantly correlated with Total n - 3, ALA and EPA + DHA intakes. Foods sources of EPA + DHA eaten by at least 50\% of participants were chicken, shrimp, tuna and eggs. Discussion Given the beneficial cardiovascular effects of n - 3 fatty acids, it is important to understand sociocultural factors affecting adequate intake towards an improvement in diet quality in minorities. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

The present study extends Berzonsky's theorizing to acculturation research and examines the social-cognitive processes underlying identity development of new immigrants ( N= 218). We investigate informational (analytical and exploratory), normative (heritage and host) and diffuse-avoidant identity styles as predictors of identity commitment and identity outcomes (self-esteem, self-concept clarity and ethno-cultural identity conflict). Two positive and two negative pathways to identity outcomes were identified, which were fully or partially mediated by identity commitment. Analytical informational style and normative orientation to the host society predicted stronger identity commitment, which, in turn, resulted in more positive identity outcomes. In contrast, diffuse-avoidant and exploratory informational styles exerted negative effects on identity outcomes via identity commitment. Furthermore, identity commitment buffered the negative impact of normative orientation to the country of origin on self-esteem. Taken together our findings indicate that identity commitment plays a central role in identity reconstruction of new immigrants.}

This study represents an extension of our previous work and aimed to unpack the perceived neighborhood ethnic density (ED) effect and examine the moderating role of ED on the acculturation–adjustment relation in a community sample of migrants with trauma (N = 99) from developing countries residing in Montreal, Canada. ED was protective against general psychological distress but did not predict posttraumatic symptoms. The ED effect was mediated via degree of acculturation to the French–Canadian mainstream cultural context, rather than heritage acculturation, social support, or discrimination. Moreover, protective effects of French–Canadian mainstream acculturation for depressive symptoms and life satisfaction were found under high but not low ED conditions. Similarities and differences with our previous research as well as theoretical and prevention implications are discussed from a person–environment interaction perspective.}

  Abstract = {The process of separation from one’s homeland includes the loss of internal representations or symbolic resources, such as music, landscape, literature, and climate. These symbolic resources express one’s ideas, identities, roles, and relations to each other, and contribute to the psychological reactions associated with one’s adaptation to the new country. The present study examined the psychological adjustment of 395 new immigrants to Israel from the former Soviet Union using a cross-sectional design. Results showed that the longer an immigrant stays in Israel, the greater the sense of loss of spiritual symbolic re- sources. It was also found that the greater the loss, the poorer the psycho- logical adjustment. A significant correlation was found between three categories of symbolic resources (spiritual, physical, and social) and psychological adjustment to the new environment. The significance of the findings for immigrants’ welfare and acculturation is discussed in light of past and present immigration policies in Israel.}

  Abstract = {This research examines the relationship of social capital with the acculturation attitudes and sociocultural adaptation of 122 migrants from Central Asian republics of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan) and 136 migrants from South Korea. The questionnaire included scales for assessing acculturation attitudes (integration, assimilation, and separation), individual social capital (bridging and bonding), and sociocultural adaptation. Using parallel mediation analysis, we found that acculturation attitudes for migrants from Central Asia are secondary to their social capital in relation to sociocultural adaptation. However, among migrants from South Korea, social capital is not linked to their acculturation attitudes, and in general, its role in sociocultural adaptation is lower as compared to the role of acculturation attitudes. As a whole, our research shows that although sociocultural adaptation for all ethnic groups is linked to acculturation attitudes and social capital, acculturation attitudes for certain ethnic groups can be dependent on social capital.}

Design: A survey questionnaire was administered to a convenience sample of Chinese Americans and analyzed for descriptive statistics and relationships among variables. Subjects/Settings: Participants were 600 healthy individuals, ranging from 25 to 70 years of age, living in New York City. Variables Measured: Demographic factors, degree of acculturation, food preferences, and 13 social psychological scales derived from the Theory of Planned Behavior, the Healthy Belief Model, and Social Cognitive Theory. Dependent measures assessed were intention to reduce dietary fat and behaviors related to the selection of reduced-fat diets. Statistical Analyses: Descriptive statistics, Pearsons' correlation coefficients, t-tests, one-way analyses of variance, and multiple regression analyses were used. Results: Attitude, overall health concern, and self-efficacy accounted for 58\% of the variance in behavioral intention for the entire sample. Attitude, perceived barriers, and self-efficacy accounted for 19\% of the variance in the prediction of dietary fat reduction behaviors. In general, a gradient was seen in the increased predictiveness of each regression model by degree of acculturation of the immigrants to American culture: predictiveness (R2) for behavior ranged from 15\% for the least to 34\% for the most acculturated. Acculturation was significantly related to declines in the influence of habit and of social norms.These effects were not seen by length of residency. Implications: Nutrition educators should assess the degree of acculturation of groups with whom they work and recognize that the degree of acculturation impacts the relative importance of various psychosocial variables in fat reduction behaviors.},

  Abstract = {The wellbeing of Latinx immigrants in the United States varies widely. Immigrants' changes and maintenance of their cultures, a process known as acculturation, has been postulated to explain differences in wellbeing. However, the mechanisms by which acculturation impacts wellbeing are not fully understood. This study sought to understand the relation between acculturation and wellbeing through a person-environment fit lens, with the hypothesis that the better immigrants can acculturate in ways they prefer (e.g., taking on the practices, values, and identifications they desire), the better their self-reported wellbeing. An explanatory mixed-method approach was used to examine this hypothesis. Four hundred thirty-eight Latinx immigrants (ages 18-77, M = 37.88) who had lived in the United States for less than a year to 55 years (M = 16.75 years) completed survey measures in Arizona, New Mexico, Maryland, and Virginia. A subset (n = 73) participated in 12 focus groups. The sample included naturalized citizens (31.0\%) along with authorized (33.2\%) and unauthorized (35.8\%) immigrants, and matched community immigration patterns. Data were analyzed through path analyses and constructivist grounded theory methods. Results indicated that the better Latinx immigrants could acculturate in the ways they preferred, the better their wellbeing. This relation was explained, in part, through lower levels of acculturative stress. This research suggests that practitioners and policymakers should consider ways to support immigrants to acculturate in the ways they desire as opposed to solely focusing their efforts on particular acculturation strategies.}

That silence generates questions about health risks in the contexts of HIV/AIDS and international migration. Based on a qualitative study of mainland Chinese immigrants in Canada, this paper explores the impacts of immigration processes on sex and sexuality. The findings reveal a gap between these individuals' changing sexual behaviours and the continuing silence on sex. Although Canada has exposed them to a new living environment that has shaped the dynamics and patterns of their sexual practices, their incomplete integration into the host society and their close connections with China as the home country mean that traditional Chinese norms continue to influence their understanding of these changes. With the increasing openness of these immigrants' sexual relationships, the obsolescence of their consciousness and knowledge of sexuality should be addressed in order to reduce their vulnerability to sexual inequalities and consequent health risks. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.}

Members of five ethnocultural groups (88 Brazilians, 98 Colombians, 139 Ecuadorians, 105 North and 85 Sub-Saharan Africans) answered a self-report questionnaire. The study aimed first to replicate the findings of previous investigations regarding the predictors of sociocultural adaptation at the whole sample level. The results showed that length of residence in the new culture, immigration status (having resident permits or being "illegal"), and perceived discrimination were the most powerful predictors of sociocultural adjustment of immigrants. Education, relationships with host nationals and perceived cultural distance were other factors significantly associated with social difficulty in the receiving society. The second purpose of the study was to test the universality of these predictors taking into account the possibility of culture-context interaction. Length of residence, immigration status and perceived discrimination were found to be independent or semi-independent of the context and culture. On the other hand, other variables contributed the explanation of outcomes of adjustment of the ethnocultural groups in their specific context. As predicted, the groups varied in their degree of social difficulty: the Colombians and the immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest degree of self-reported difficulty, the Ecuadorians had a medium degree, and the Brazilians and the North Africans had the lowest. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach: The sample consisted of 141 host community (Dutch) and 41 non-western immigrant workers of a postal service company who filled out a questionnaire. Methods of analyses include analysis of variance and multiple regression. Findings: In line with the IAM, results showed that a higher disconcordance in preferred acculturation orientations between host community and immigrant workers related to a poorer quality of intergroup work-relations. However, intergroup contact moderated this relationship differently for host community and immigrant workers. Research limitations/implications: Data are cross-sectional and collected in one organization. Future studies should replicate the findings to other organizational contexts, cultural groups, and collect longitudinal data to determine causal effects. Practical implications: Organizations should monitor disconcordance in acculturation orientations amongst host community and immigrant workers. A multicultural culture in organizations may reduce disconcordance in acculturation orientations between host community and immigrant workers. Originality/value: The paper helps to explain the mixed findings in cultural diversity research so far, by demonstrating that disconcordance in acculturation orientations relates negatively to intergroup work-relations in a multicultural workplace. © 2010 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.}

  Abstract = {The project Mutual Intercultural Research in Plural Societies was designed to examine three hypotheses of intercultural relations: the multiculturalism hypothesis, the integration hypothesis, and the contact hypothesis. These hypotheses were derived from the Canadian multiculturalism policy (Berry, 1984), and their validity has been assessed in a number of countries. Our goal was to evaluate these hypotheses in Russia (Moscow) and Latvia (Riga). We used sociopsychological surveys of two dominant groups (Russian Muscovites and Latvians in Riga) and two nondominant groups (migrants from the Caucasus in Moscow and the Russian minority in Riga) employing structural equation modeling. A sense of perceived security promoted tolerance toward other cultural groups in three of the samples. Perceived security was related significantly to multicultural ideology in Riga, but there was no significant relationship to multicultural ideology in the Moscow samples. A preference for the integration strategy among the migrants in Moscow as well as among the Russians in Latvia promoted their better sociocultural adaptation and had a significant impact on the life satisfaction of the Muscovites but had no impact on the Latvian sample in Riga. Our results provided some support for the effect of intercultural contact on the acceptance of others in three of the groups: the migrants in Moscow, the Russian minority in Riga, and the dominant group in Moscow. However, among the Russians in Riga, the relationship between contacts and perceived security was negative. The multiculturalism hypothesis was confirmed with the dominant group in Riga and was partly confirmed with both the dominant and the nondominant groups in Moscow and with the Russian minority in Riga. The contact hypothesis received partial support with both groups in Moscow and the Russian minority in Riga but was not confirmed with the Latvians in Riga. There was partial support for the role of the integration strategy in promoting sociocultural adaptation and well-being among the migrants in Moscow and the Muscovites. These findings require additional analysis of the sociopolitical and historical context in Latvia in order to understand the psychological outcomes of acculturation among the Russian minority there.}

A community sample of 140 self-reported undocumented Latino immigrants completed questionnaires measuring national and ethnic identity, perceived discrimination, life satisfaction, and flourishing. Latent class analysis extracted three of Berry’s acculturation approaches (separation, integration/biculturalism, and marginalization). Pairwise comparisons indicated that the bicultural approach was the most adaptive, followed by the separated approach. In addition to validating Berry’s acculturation model among undocumented Latino immigrants, the current study taps into psychology’s commitment to social justice and diversity by extending the literature on the acculturation approaches that may be most beneficial for this highly neglected population. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.}

One hundred and five forced and voluntary African migrants to New Zealand completed a questionnaire, which included two measures (a) the Psychological Motives to Migrate (Tharmaseelan, 2005) and (b) the Psychological Acculturation Index (Mace, 2004). Demographic information, including data on the New Zealand government immigration categories through which the migrant gained entry and length of time in New Zealand, was also col- lected. Multivariate analyses indicated that motivations to migrate do matter when it comes to acculturation preferences. Further, it was found that psychological motives to migrate were better pre- dictors of acculturation preferences than the government immigration categories. Specifically, voluntary migrants (those motivated by 'family life improvement' and 'exploration') preferred to adapt to New Zealand culture, while forced migrants (those motivated by 'escaping') had a higher prefer- ence to maintain their culture of origin. Duration of time in New Zealand was correlated with acculturation preferences. Implications of the findings point to the importance of assessing motiva- tions to migrate from a psychological perspective.}

It is unclear whether this association is mediated through genetic, environmental or cultural factors individually or in combination. This pilot study aimed to explore this interaction by determining if acculturation in migrant groups contributed to the prevalence of ADIMD. Method: Culturally diverse but relatively genetically homogeneous (white Caucasian) patients with schizophrenia (n = 40) treated at a single site were assessed for the presence of ADIMD and level of acculturation. Results: Higher levels of acculturation correlated with an increased prevalence of TD and akathisia but not Parkinsonism. The level of acculturation significantly predicted TD. Conclusion: This study identifies for the first time that acculturation significantly contributes to the prevalence of TD and akathisia but not Parkinsonism in culturally diverse migrant populations and must be accounted for when explaining ethnic variation in rates of ADIMD.

The aim of the present study is to test the influence of immigrants' self-construal on the choice of acculturation strategy. A second aim is to examine the influence of acculturation on psychological health, as well as to determine the interaction between all these three factors, i.e., self-construal, acculturation and psychological health. In a sample of 120 immigrants, 62 of whom were Indians and 58 Albanians, we found that integration correlates positively with interdependent self-construal and with independent self-construal, whereas separation correlates neither with independent nor with interdependent self-construal. Also, there is a statistically significant difference between the participants with high and low level of independent self-construal, with the difference to being favor of the participants with high level of independent self-construal. As far as the relationship between acculturation and psychological health is concerned, we found that separation correlates negatively with anxiety and with depression, whereas integration correlates neither with depression nor with anxiety. Even though self-construal, in conjunction with separation, is responsible for a significant proportion of depression, the results do not meet the criteria in order to conclude that self-construal is a mediator between separation and depression.}

  Abstract = {When people perceive that they are rejected because of a group membership, identification with that group can increase, a phenomenon known as rejection-identification. Immigrants represent an interesting case for rejection-identification because (a) they can face rejection from both members of the majority group in the host country (e.g., Americans) and their ethnic community (e.g., Mexicans) specifically because of the membership in the other and (b) their ethnic and national identities are tied to different contexts and carry different levels of investment. In a survey of Latino immigrants in the United States, it was found that perceived group-based rejection from Latinos was related to lower ethnic identification and stronger identification with the United States and marginally stronger bicultural identification as Latino-American. Perceived group-based rejection from other Americans was related to stronger disidentification with the United States, but had no relationship to ethnic identification. These effects were independent of feelings of personal acceptance. The application of the rejection-identification model to the case of immigration is discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.}

In the current article, I review empirical studies on immigrant minorities that provide first evidence for (i) the phenomenon of emotional acculturation; (ii) the co-existence of heritage and new culture emotional patterns and minorities’ switching between the two; and (iii) the potential benefits of minorities’ emotional fit with culture. In addition, I outline future directions in this emergent field and highlight how the study of emotional acculturation may inform emotion psychology as it calls for a truly socio-dynamic perspective on what emotions are and how they can/should be studied.}

  Abstract = {Older Hispanics are disproportionately affected by diabetes, but little is known about predictors of diabetes self-care among this group. This study compared the magnitude of three self-care behaviors (diet, physical activity (PA), and glucose monitoring) among older Hispanics with type 2 diabetes born in the United States (n = 59) to those born in Mexico (n = 179), and investigated the influence of personal and health indicators on each self-care behavior. Findings were based on data drawn from convenience sample data collected with a questionnaire. Self-care behaviors were moderately practiced (39.5-45.8 \%) with no significant differences by nativity. Mexico-born seniors were less linguistically acculturated (P {\textless} 0.001). Being female (OR = 2.41) and PA levels (OR = 2.62) were significantly associated with diet. Being female (OR = 3.24), more educated (OR = 3.73), U.S.-born (OR = 2.84), and receiving diabetes education (OR = 3.67) were associated with PA. Diabetes education (OR = 2.41) was associated with glucose monitoring. Although acculturation influenced only PA and no other behaviors, personal and cultural factors require further investigation to design diabetes management strategies for Hispanic seniors at the border region. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.}

Factors such as cultural knowledge, length of stay in the new culture, and linguistic competence strongly influence this process. Length of stay and linguistic competence may be essential for cultural knowledge acquisition that, in turn, may be enhanced by mass media consumption. A questionnaire is completed by 576 immigrants (196 Romanians, 179 North Africans, and 201 Latino Americans) investigating time spent in Italy, proficiency in the Italian language, familiarity with Italian and homeland mass media, and acculturation. The authors hypothesize that language plays a central role in the acculturation process and assume that length of stay influences acculturation mostly through linguistic competence and mass media knowledge. A structural equation model is tested to verify the hypothesis. The model results are acceptable, invariant across genders, and partially invariant across ethno-cultural groups. © 2009 SAGE Publications.}

Results confirmed the expected association between acculturation strategies, social distance, and positive emotions toward the outgroup. Italian participants that choose inte- gration as the acculturation strategy showed: lower social distance, more positive emotional feelings to- ward immigrants, higher social well-being. Furthermore, results showed that for immigrants higher levels of social support nullify the positive effects of intergroup contact on social distance or even increase im- migrants’ intentions to distance themselves from Italians.}

One hundred and ten Turkish immigrants were surveyed through questionnaires. Despite high educational attainments, two-thirds of the sample were either unemployed or underemployed. Inability to fully integrate into the labour force in the first six months in Canada was attributed mainly to lack of competence in both official languages, difficulty in getting credentials and accreditations recognized in Canada, and lack of Canadian work experience. In time, these barriers were overcome. In their place, market conditions (e.g., economic recession) delayed full participation in the work force. The model developed and tested through LISREL 8 demonstrated that adversity experienced in employment life, such as status loss, unemployment and underemployment had a negative impact on both psychological well-being and adaptation to Canada.}

  Abstract = {Previous research has shown that migrants develop various styles to adjust to a new culture. The present study was concerned with two questions: (1) Why do some migrants prefer a particular acculturation style whereas others adopt a different one, and (2) why do some migrants reveal a higher level of adjustment than others? In a sample of 349 immigrants living in Germany (199 Turks and 150 North-Africans), we investigated the influence of emotional intelligence (EI) with the Trait-Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS). Acculturation styles were assessed with the Acculturation Attitudes Scale (AAS) as well as specific markers of acculturation behavior. Adjustment was captured by the Satisfaction with life scale (SWLS), the subjective happiness scale (SHS), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) as an inverse marker. Additionally, we assessed perceived unfairness and discrimination. Findings show that EI and its subcomponents are related to beneficial forms of acculturation attitudes and acculturation behavior. EI was also shown to affect acculturation experiences, such as perceived discrimination and perceived unfairness, as well as a number of psychological adjustment variables.}

Given the current socio-political climate and the limited research, the present exploratory study explores the relationship between acculturation, ethnic identity, self-identity, generational status, religiosity, and demographics among adult Australian Muslims. A cross-sectional convenience sample of 324 adult Australian Muslims completed either online or paper-based questionnaires in either English or Arabic. Recruitment was via convenience sampling and social media advertisements. Acculturation, ethnic identity (MEIM), religiosity, and demographic variables were measured. The study sample was young and mostly female, with high religiosity levels. Acculturation was negatively correlated with ethnic identity. From multiple regression analysis, acculturation was predicted independently by religiosity (low), age (young), gender (male) and ethnic identity (low). First generation Australian Muslims were older, had stronger ethnic identity and religiosity, and more commonly self-identified as non-Australian. By contrast second- and third-generation were more likely to self-identify as bicultural or Australian. In summary, acculturation of Australian Muslims is influenced by multiple variables, particularly ethnic identity, religiosity, and generation; hence all these variables need to be included in policy regarding successful integration of migrants.}

  Abstract = {This study seeks to identify risk factors for psychiatric disorders that may explain differences in nativity effects among adult Latinos in the USA. We evaluate whether factors related to the processes of acculturation and enculturation, immigration factors, family stressors and supports, contextual factors, and social status in the US account for differences in 12-month prevalence of psychiatric disorders for eight subgroups of Latinos. We report results that differentiate Latino respondents by country of origin and age at immigration (whether they were US-born or arrived before age 6: In-US-as-Child [IUSC]; or whether they arrived after age 6: later-arrival immigrants [LAI]). After age and gender adjustments, LAI Mexicans and IUSC Cubans reported a significantly lower prevalence of depressive disorders than IUSC Mexicans. Once we adjust for differences in family stressors, contextual factors and social status factors, these differences are no longer significant. The risk for anxiety disorders appears no different for LAI compared to IUSC Latinos, after age and gender adjustments. For substance use disorders, family factors do not offset the elevated risk of early exposure to neighborhood disadvantage, but coming to the US after age 25 does offset it. Family conflict and burden were consistently related to the risk of mood disorders. Our findings suggest that successful adaptation into the US is a multidimensional process that includes maintenance of family harmony, integration in advantageous US neighborhoods, and positive perceptions of social standing. Our results uncover that nativity may be a less important independent risk factor for current psychiatric morbidity than originally thought. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

  Abstract = {The relations of perceived cultural distance, personality, acculturation orientations and outcomes were studied among exchange students (N¼187) in Russia who came from various countries in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the former Soviet Union. The hypothesis was supported that a larger perceived cultural distance between mainstream and immigrant culture is associated with less psychological (homesickness and stress) and sociocultural (behaviour with Russian students and behaviour with co-nationals) adjustment. The statistical relations between perceived cultural distance, personality and sociocultural adjustment were much stronger for host domain behaviour than for home domain behaviour. Adjustment was higher for participants with more cultural empathy, openmindedness and flexibility. Adjustment showed statistically stronger associations with cultural distance than with acculturation orientations. It is concluded that cultural distance may be more salient than acculturation orientations in studies of heterogeneous groups of immigrants.}

Methods: A randomly stratified sample of 353 Hispanics aged 45 and older were interviewed. The immigrant group (n = 148) was compared with native-born Mexican Americans (n = 205). Results: The findings showed that the native-born group was not significantly different from the immigrant group on measures of depression, health status, life satisfaction, or self-esteem. The immigrant group was found to report significantly more stress than the Mexican American group. Income, age, gender, and acculturation were significant predictors of well-being, whereas immigration status and years of residency were not. Discussion: The well-being of Mexican immigrants in the United States is confounded by such variables as income, age, gender, and acculturation, along with various other contextual factors that characterize their life experiences in the United States.}

One-hundred and fifty nonclinical East Asian immigrants (75 males and 75 females) were administered the East Asian Acculturation Measure (EAAM) and provided demographic information concerning length of stay in the United States and gender. Satisfactory reliability is reported for the four acculturation scales: assimilation, separation, integration, and marginalization. Length of stay was not associated with separation but was significantly positively associated with assimilation and integration and significantly negatively associated with marginalization. Gender was not associated with any of the acculturation scales. The findings suggest that the EAAM may be a useful tool for researchers and clinicians to investigate the acculturation patterns of East Asian immigrants.}

Second, we aimed at developing an intergroup behavioural tendencies scale that differentiates between valence (facilitation and harm) and intensity (active and passive). The role of intergroup contact was also examined, as it is a known predictor of intergroup prejudice. In order to fulfil these goals, we carried out two studies. In Study 1, Spanish participants (N = 279) answered a questionnaire about Moroccans (a devalued group) or Ecuadorians (a valued group) by reporting their acculturation preferences for immigrants, their positive and negative emotions, quantity of contact with them and behavioural tendencies towards them. In Study 2, Moroccans (N = 92) and Ecuadorians (N = 87) assessed Spaniards on these measures. Results confirmed the structure of the new behavioural tendencies scale across four groups of participants. Overall, findings also showed that acculturation preferences and quantity of contact indirectly predicted behavioural tendencies through positive emotions. This research contributes to knowledge on how the majority and minority's acculturation preferences are related to their emotions and specific dimensions of intergroup behavioural tendencies, confirming the predominant mediating role of positive emotions in this process.}

Two main dimensions of immigrants’ success were outlined: economic success and psychological well-being, when the latter included ‘sense of belonging' and 'life satisfaction'. An instrument measuring both dimensions of success was developed. The study was based on data from the 2011 Immigrant Survey completed by a representative sample of the immigrant population in Israel, including 2927 immigrants from the Former Soviet Union, Asia \& Africa, Europe \& America, and Ethiopia. Structural Equation Modeling were used to generate the model of immigrants' success. The main paths of success were outlined. The path of the low-skilled visible minority contrasted with the path of other, more highly skilled groups of immigrants who resembled the local majority population to a greater degree. Understanding factors shaping the success of immigrants from different countries of origin might be used by policymakers to foster immigrants’ economic and psychological well-being.}

The current study examines immigrant intentions to leave the host country, but not necessarily to return to the homeland. The predictive model, which focuses on immigrant subjective identity, was tested through a survey of 338 first and 1.5 generation Former Soviet Union (FSU) immigrants in Israel, who applied to a prominent NGO to obtain proof of their Jewishness. These individuals are from the largest recent immigrant group in Israel, and are highly represented among the young adult (aged 25–40) immigrants leaving Israel. The findings indicate that contrary to our expectations, Israeli local identity did not have a significant effect on the immigrants’ intentions to leave Israel. By contrast, Jewish identity and level of religiosity did play a significant role in attenuating the immigrant’s tendency to leave. This paper highlights the complex relationship between ethnic identities and religiosity among immigrants in general, and in Israel in particular.}

In this context, it is crucial to understand the commitment people feel to a cultural environment and the way in which such commitment develops, particularly in new cultural settings. However, there is a lack of research on identity development among adult immigrants and natives and a lack of suitable measurement instruments. To address this, we adapted the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure–Revised (MEIM–R) for application to immigrant and native adult populations and extended it to measure also national identity. Our aim in the present study was to test the psychometric properties of this new Multigroup Ethnic \& National Identity Measure (MENI) in a representative sample (N = 3410) of immigrant and native adults (aged 20–72 years) in a European context, namely Germany. Results based on confirmatory factor analyses support a two-factor structure (commitment and exploration) for MENI and confirm scalar invariance across both the immigrant and native adult populations.}

Still, most of the immigrant acculturation and wellbeing literature remains acontextual, thus limiting understanding of why some immigrants thrive while others struggle.

It then answered two questions unexplained by the model: (1) Why would ideal acculturation differ from real acculturation? and (2) What impact does the divergence of real acculturation from ideal acculturation have on wellbeing? To address these questions, the current study adopted a concurrent explanatory mixed-method approach (Creswell \& Plano-Clark, 2007). Four hundred eighty Latina/o immigrants were recruited from two state pairs (i.e., Arizona and New Mexico, Maryland and Virginia), chosen for their demographic characteristics and immigration-related public policies, to participate in survey measures. A subset of participants (n = 73) participated in 12 focus groups. Quantitative data were primarily analyzed through ANOVA and path analyses and qualitative data were analyzed through constructivist grounded theory, informed by the constructs under study. Results indicated that participants wished to and did adopt more of their receiving communities’ cultures in peripheral (e.g., work, economics, political systems, social welfare) and intermediate (e.g., social relationships, friendships) life domains than they did in central (e.g., family relationships, religious customs, ways of thinking, principles, values) life domains. Conversely, they wished to and did maintain their cultures in central life domains more than they did in other life domains. They had more difficulties changing and maintaining cultural customs in preferred ways in peripheral domains. Participants in Arizona, and to some degree, Virginia, were less able to make desired cultural changes than participants in Maryland and New Mexico. The proposed socio-ecological model of acculturation fit the data well, explaining why real acculturation may differ from ideal acculturation. A set of personal and contextual factors (i.e., ideal cultural change; quality of contact with, and acculturative preferences and prejudicial attitudes of the receiving community; perceived threat, and immigration-related public policies) predicted Latina/o immigrants’ cultural changes, directly and/or indirectly through their sense of community with the receiving community and/or intergroup anxiety. A similar set of factors influenced Latina/o immigrants’ cultural maintenance, directly and/or indirectly through their sense of community with the local Latina/o immigrant community. Qualitative data also indicated that personal characteristics, community resources, and information impacted the ways in which Latina/o immigrants changed and maintained their cultures. Finally, the better Latina/o immigrants were able to change and maintain their cultures in desired ways, the better their self-reported wellbeing, in part due to less acculturative stress with the receiving community. In sum, this study provides insight into reasons for the diverse array of Latina/o immigrant acculturation and wellbeing in the United States in light of their disparate contexts, preferences, and experiences.}

  Abstract = {This study analyzed the dietary pattern of Southeast Asian workers (Vietnamese, Thais, Cambodians and Myanmar) living in South Korea in order to recognize the dietary changes after they moved to South Korea. Questionnaires were completed by 251 Southeast Asian workers living in South Korea. Using a self-administered questionnaire, we assessed the diets before and after living in the hometown and in South Korea. Significant changes observed in the Southeast Asian workers were decreased in consumption frequency of fresh fruits, cooked vegetables, rice noodles, green tea and glutinous rice, and increase in consumption of Kimchi, seaweed, milk, coffee and pizza. These changes were attributed to rapid dietary acculturation. The frequencies of eating homemade food were significantly decreased after they came to Korea except for Thais. Thais showed the highest frequencies of eating homemade food daily among others. 28.2\% of respondents said their health condition had deteriorated after living in South Korea due to difficulties to adapt Korean food, increased frequencies of eating instant food, and lacking exercises. By providing understanding of the dietary patterns of Southeast Asian workers, these results can be used for preliminary data to develop a program for their Korean food adaptation.

  Abstract = {This study examined the role of value patterns of potential migrants from Russia to Finland (N = 229) in predicting expectations of post-migration socio-cultural adaptation. Furthermore, the fit between migrants’ personal values and the values they expect to encounter in the new home country (i.e. perceived value congruence) was hypothesized to predict anticipated socio-cultural adaptation (ASCA). The study took into account perceived cultural distance variables as well as socio-demographic controls traditionally related to adaptation outcomes among migrants. According to the results, familiarity with the host country (i.e., the number of Finnish friends/relatives in Finland), the openness to change value and perceived value congruence significantly predicted potential migrants’ ASCA. When using four sub-scales (interpersonal relations, cognitive understanding, impersonal perils and bureaucracy) of the ASCA-scale, a more complex picture emerged. The results suggest that future work should include values, particularly perceived value congruence, in the analysis of the cultural fit hypothesis, as well as find better means of supporting immigrant adjustment starting at the pre-migration stage.

  Keywords = {\#duplicate-citation-key, P-1126},
  Abstract = {The current chapter argues for the importance of recontextualizing psychological research designs with social ecology, especially in the fields of social and (cross-) cultural psychology. 'Western' cultural and historical influences have likely contributed to the modus operandi of these disciplines in recent decades, reflected by a shift in focus towards individual-level variables in the absence of situational factors, and internal rather than external validity in research designs. One example is acculturation research, an area that has been extensively critiqued in recent years for methodological shortcomings as well as a lack of attention to context. Community psychology perspectives have begun remediating this problem, highlighting the relevance of person-environment interactions in understanding adjustment. In line with such thinking, we profile our acculturation research programme with immigrants in Montreal, Canada, which has included both perceived and actual ethnic density as contextual variables. Our results shed light on some of the contrasting findings in both ethnic density and acculturation research literatures by recognizing that the two variables are likely to be closely interwoven. This research has also begun the process of unpacking the mechanisms of ethnic density effects that might act as mental health protective factors in immigrants. Clinical implications are discussed, as well as the mutually dependent nature between psychological and contextual variables. We make the case for greater collaboration between disciplines such as psychology, psychiatric epidemiology, anthropology, neuroscience, and sociology in order to generate more meaningful research. "Without understanding social structures, personal troubles cannot be solved" Oishi, Kesebir, and Snyder (2009, p. 336) "Most psychologists are so preoccupied with the salient features of the individual's mental life that they are prone to forget it is the ground of the social group that gives to the individual his figured character. Just as the bed of a stream shapes the direction and tempo of the flow of water, so does the group determine the current of an individual's life" Allport (1948, p. vii) "Psychological development and psychological change are not privatized individualized processes which happen regardless of social context, but are intrinsically and dynamically related to the individual's specific context" Moane (1999, p. 7)},

Additionally, the moderating role of age was analyzed. A multiple-group path analysis was performed on data collected from 256 Tunisians in early and 248 in middle adolescence living in Italy, which is an interesting and understudied immigrant group characterized by similarities and differences with the host population. In younger adolescents, EIE and EIC were indirectly and positively related to acculturative stress via the mediating role of in-group favoritism and out-group derogation. In older adolescents, EIE was related to higher levels of EIC, which, in turn, was predictive of acculturative stress. The findings are discussed in light of the theoretical framework, research context and limitations, and implications for practice are presented.}

A core component of any culture is its prioritization of values. Immigrants and minority members learn diverging value hierarchies from their multiple cultures, and as a result, may hold a complex value system. In this chapter, we propose that immigrants and minority members hold contextualized value systems relevant to the values of the country of residence and of the ethnic-group. We investigate the value priorities of countries (Israel and Germany) and of ethnic-groups (former Soviet Union immigrants, Arab citizens of Israel, Turkish immigrants). We examine the relations between these modal group values and the contextualized values of group members. Last, we examine the interaction between the contextualized values and acculturation strategies. The research adds to the existing literature in its focus on acculturation in value priorities across contexts, and in its large cross cultural sample.

Self-reported scales ENRICH EMS and the Iranian Acculturation scale were completed 27 heterosexual married participants. Results of the multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the relationship between acculturation and levels of marital satisfaction among Iranian immigrant individuals were insignificant. Additionally, the data suggests that arranged marriages have a significant impact on both marital satisfaction and level of acculturation of heterosexual married Iranian immigrants. Heterosexual married Iranian immigrants that had arranged marriages have significantly higher marital satisfaction or higher acculturation levels than heterosexual married Iranian immigrants that did not experience arranged marriages. These findings imply that further research shall be conducted in order to understand the impact of acculturation and marital satisfaction on Iranian immigrants.}

  Abstract = {Although research has documented cultural variability in respondent comprehension and interpretation of survey questions, little information is currently available on the role that acculturation might play in minimizing cross-cultural differences in the comprehension or interpretation of survey questions. To investigate this problem, we examine the potential effects of acculturation to host culture on respondent comprehension of a set of health survey questions among two distinct Latino populations on the US mainland: Mexican-Americans and Puerto Ricans. Specifically, comprehension-related respondent behaviors coded from 345 face-to-face interviews conducted with Mexican-American, Puerto Rican, African American, and non-Latino White adults living in Chicago are examined. Findings indicate that Latino respondents who were born outside of the US and who have a preference for communicating in Spanish, relative to English, were more likely to express comprehension difficulties. These findings suggest that pretest survey instruments with immigrant populations may be a useful strategy for identifying problematic questions. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  Title = {Role of acculturation on oral contraceptive use among {Korean} immigrant women},
  Year = {2007},
  Keywords = {\#duplicate-citation-key, P-1100},
  Abstract = {The current dissertation study was formatted as a manuscript style and consisted of three unified, journal-ready manuscripts. Manuscript I and II correspond to a systematic review of the literature on attitudes toward oral contraceptive (OC) use among women of reproductive age and the relationship of acculturation with contraceptive use patterns among immigrants, respectively. Manuscript III corresponds to the main dissertation study that was conducted to explore the role of acculturation on OC use among Korean immigrant women. It was specifically aimed to explore the effect of acculturation on attitudes, subjective norms, and intention, with regard to OC use in this population. For the most part, manuscript III presents the methodology of this empirical dissertation study, including the design and methods, statistical analysis, and findings. The Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA; Ajzen \& Fishbein, 1980), incorporated with the concept of acculturation, provided the theoretical framework for this study. A random sample of 146 Korean immigrant women was selected from the five boroughs (Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island) of the City of New York, based on Korean surname-based telephone lists. Data were collected using a telephone survey interview from September 2006 to February 2007. Participants were asked to respond to demographic and OC use history questionnaires, Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identify Acculturation Scale (SL-ASIA: Suinn, Rickard-Figueroa, Lew, \& Vigil, 1987), and Lee's Oral Contraceptive Use Scale (LOCUS) with five subscales. Pearson correlations, multiple regressions, and hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the hypotheses formulated by a modified version of the TRA model. In general, participants reported low to moderate levels of acculturation. Their attitudes toward OC use were slightly positive, whereas normative pressure and intention to use OCs tended to be negative. The results of analysis revealed that acculturation explained some of the variance in attitudes, subjective norms, and intention to use OCs. Women who were moderately acculturated, as opposed to those who were low acculturated, tended to believe that OC use would lead to positive outcomes and evaluated positively the act of using OCs. In turn, these women held a more favorable attitude toward OC use. In addition, the more acculturated women were, the more likely they were to perceive social pressure to and intend to use OCs. Nevertheless, the findings should be carefully interpreted in that only small portions (i.e., 3-6\%) of the variances in attitudes, subjective norms, and intention were accounted for by acculturation. This might be due to the low variability in acculturation scores (1.7 to 3.5) obtained in this study. To capture the full scope of acculturation on OC use, future studies must include participants with a broader range of acculturation, including Korean American whose acculturation levels differ substantially from immigrants'.}

We find that acculturation remains an important determinant of Latino health; however, this varies based on whether the sample is restricted to immigrants or includes all Latino adults and on the measures of acculturation employed. We find Latino citizens reported better health than non-citizens; however, other acculturation measures, such as language use and time in the U.S. do not have a marked effect. Furthermore, skin color matters only for U.S.-born Latinos. Racialization is therefore important to consider within the context of the Hispanic paradox. Our findings suggest that some of the disadvantages stemming from minority status in the U.S. are more prominent among Latinos who have greater experience with the racial hierarchy of the U.S. and greater acculturation more broadly.},

This study examined the relationship between biculturality and HIV-related risk behaviors in a sample of injecting and non injecting Puerto Rican drug users (N = 259), recruited in New York City in 2005-2006. Biculturality was measured by two scales: involvement in (i) American culture (AMBIC) and (ii) Puerto Rican culture Biculturality (PRBIC). The majority (78\%) of the participants were males, with a mean age of 42 years. About half were born in Puerto Rico, and the average length of stay in the United States was 26 years. In multiple logistic-regression analysis, AMBIC was significantly related to lower injection risk after controlling for other factors including gender, age, and MMTP enrollment, while PRBIC was a significant predictor of higher sex risk. Involvement in the host culture and the culture of origin differed in their relationship to risk behaviors, indicating that incorporating assessments of biculturality may be useful in assessing and addressing migrants' behaviors, including HIV-risk behaviors. The study's limitations have been noted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

Berry's acculturation theories suggest that immigrants' mental health can be negatively affected by their experience of biological and psychosocial difficulties related to acculturation. Data from a nationally representative study, the New Immigrant Survey, was utilized to examine how acculturation stress factors can predict depressive symptoms in a sub-Saharan African sample of 669 adults. The collectivistic nature of African culture suggests that family support is a critical element in the acculturation process, but family support was not found to be a predictor of help-seeking behavior. Results indicated that when birth country was controlled for, proficient English language skills and higher education level were predictive of increased help-seeking behavior. Additionally, English language proficiency was negatively associated with depressive symptoms. Findings suggest that proficiency in host country's language serves as a protective factor against depressive symptoms, and English proficiency and higher educational attainment predict greater use of support systems in African immigrants. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor \& Francis.}

  Abstract = {Adolescence is a critical developmental period as youth explore their body image and work to establish an identity. The stress of identity and body image development can be exacerbated by acculturative stress faced by immigrant adolescents. Using a person-centered analysis, we investigated immigrant adolescents’ (n = 57) profiles based on assimilation to the United States (US), weight, and body image dissatisfaction. Analyses included an exploratory two-step clustering technique using maximum likelihood estimation procedures to assign class membership. Follow-up analyses then examined latent class membership by adolescent age, gender, culture of origin, and immigration generation. Results indicated several meaningful latent groups of adolescents based on their BID, acculturation, and BMI. These profiles included one in which adolescents who were underweight and more assimilated to US culture also reported more satisfaction with their body image. A second profile emerged of adolescents who were normal weight or overweight and less assimilated, who also reported higher levels of body image dissatisfaction, with a desire to be thinner. The third cluster profile included adolescents who were of normal weight, but were higher on assimilation and were among the most dissatisfied with their body image. Our findings suggest that immigrant adolescents at all levels of acculturation are internalizing the thin body ideal prominent in the US, with a variety of implications for their sense of body image and BMI. Implications for mental and physical health care for immigrant adolescents are discussed.},

Seventy predominantly skilled immigrants to New Zealand provided indices of (a) to (d) through a sample survey, whilst (e) was measured with the added assistance of 20 experienced recruitment agencies, interviewed by telephone. Path analysis suggested that feelings about occupational life are related to proximity to full employment, which is itself predicted by a combination of (a) and (d), but not (b), (c) or (e). Links between proximity to employment and feelings about occupational life in New Zealand were unexpectedly negative, but only moderately stable. Our findings may challenge some of the received wisdom in the vocational literature, but are nonetheless consistent with implicit prejudice from prospective employers, and with a lived vocational experience of relative deprivation amongst immigrants themselves.

  Abstract = {The authors investigated how 2 groups with unequal social power-immigrant adolescents from Ethiopia (n = 241) and the former USSR (n = 531)-and their Israeli host peers (n = 854) might construct an immigrant identity regarding adaptation to life in their new country. The authors introduce the concept of immigrant identity representations based an integrative model combining parts of J. W. Berry's (1990) acculturation model (BAM) and H. Tajfel's (1981) version of social identity theory (SIT). The findings reveal a common pattern of identity representations and are interpreted in terms of the integrative combination of the BAM and SIT frameworks. Copyright © 2009 Heldref Publications.},

  Abstract = {Background: Political and social developments point at increasing marginalization of Muslim migrants, but little is known about its consequences for the mental health of this particular group. Aim: To explore the relationship between acculturation and psychological distress among first-generation Muslim migrants from Turkey and Morocco in the Netherlands. Methods: A cross-sectional study. Respondents were interviewed in their preferred language. Acculturation was measured with the Lowlands Acculturation Scale (LAS) and psychological distress with the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Data were complete for 321 subjects and analyzed with multivariate linear regression. Results: Less skills for living in Dutch society was associated with distress (p = 0.032). Feelings of loss were related to distress among Moroccans (p = 0.037). There was an interaction between traditionalism and ethnic background ( p = 0.037); traditionalism was related to less distress among Moroccans (p = 0.020), but not among Turkish. Finally, there was an interaction by gender among Turks (p = 0.029); conservative norms and values seemed to be related to distress among men (p = 0.062), not women. Conclusion: Successful contact and participation in Dutch society, and maintenance of heritage culture and identity were moderately associated with less psychological distress. Improving mastery of the dominant language in host societies, and allowing migrants to preserve their traditions, might be effective measures in improving the mental well-being of migrants.

  Abstract = {Abstract. How immigrants define their ethnicity and nationality is relevant for integration: They can identify with their ethnic group, the receiving society, and a combination of both. A longitudinal study with elementary-school children with migration background ( N = 200; age 9–10) in Germany investigated the predictors and stability of ethnic and national identities. Ethnic identity was more highly endorsed than national identity. National and dual identities were compatible (i.e., positively related), whereas ethnic identity was compartmentalized (i.e., unrelated to national and dual identities). Contact with Germans predicted national identity over time, but not vice versa. Thus, the study contributes to a better understanding of multiple social identities of young ethnic minority children in light of social psychological theories of social identity development.}

  Abstract = {This paper investigates Internet-usage patterns of immigrants, and seeks to identify the correlation between Internet use and intercultural adaptation. The study focuses on mainland Chinese immigrants in Singapore, and was conducted via a nationwide telephone survey. The results show that immigrants tend to change their preferences on Internet use to reflect their residence in the host country. In particular, the longer an immigrant resides in the host country, the less likely they would be to surf their original country’s websites and the more likely they would be to communicate with local people via the Internet. More importantly, differences in Internet usage are found to have a significant impact on immigrants’ intercultural adaptation. In an online environment, the social communication in the host country is a critical component that can facilitate or impede immigrants’ successful adaptation to the host country, whereas ethnic social communication also plays a role at the initial stage of transition.

  Abstract = {The present study evaluated the integration of elderly people who migrated to Israel during their lifetimes. Subjective well-being, as measured by the immigrants’ perception of quality of life, satisfaction with life and emotional state, served as a general indicator of integration. The integration of elderly immigrants has not received adequate attention in the literature. A unique database (SHARE-Israel) that was recently released has made study of this topic possible. The current study sample was composed of former migrants aged 50 and older (n = 930). The analytic model examined ethnic origin and migration variables in relation to the respective subjective outcomes, controlling for sociodemographic background, human and social capital and health. The findings show that in general, ethnic origin seems to matter less for the evaluation of immigrants’ subjective well-being than other socio economic factors such as economic status, social capital and health status. However, recent arrivals from the Former Soviet Union do differ from all other immigrant groups in their lower levels of well-being. In addition, the study points to the importance of language proficiency as a central means for integration in the destination country. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

  Abstract = {This study examined the relationship between acculturation, depression, and anxiety in Jewish Iranian immigrants. A nonrandom sample of 72 Jewish Iranian men and women, ages 21 to 79, and residing in Southern California were recruited for the purpose of this study. Participants were administered four research instruments: a demographic (background) questionnaire, the Cultural Life Style Inventory (Mendoza, 1989) adapted for Iranian Americans to measure acculturation, the Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition (Beck et al., 1996), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (Beck \& Steer, 1993). Two hypotheses were used to examine the relationship between acculturation, depression, and anxiety. Hypothesis one stated that there would be a significant relationship between type of acculturation (Immersion into the U.S. culture, Immersion into the Iranian culture, and Bicultural Immersion) and depression. Hypothesis one had three components. Hypothesis 1a stated that as immersion into the U.S. culture increased, depression scores would decrease. The results supported hypothesis 1a as stated (r = -.389, p {\textless} .001). Hypothesis 1b stated that as immersion into the Iranian culture increased, depression scores would increase.

  Abstract = {Several variants of biculturalism have recently been proposed (Schwartz, Birman, Benet-Martínez, \& Unger, 2016). Nevertheless, few studies have identified different types of bicultural individuals, and no one has addressed the possibility that these types could depend on acculturation domains. By using the Relative Acculturation Extended Model (RAEM), this study aimed to explore if different variants of biculturalism could be individuated, and if some of these variants were sensitive to life domains. Four samples of migrant and host adolescents living in Italy (n = 173 and n = 186) and Spain (n = 139 and n = 156) answered a questionnaire about acculturation perceptions and preferences in central and peripheral life domains. Together with acculturation options consistent with Berry's (1997) model (full-assimilation, full-separation and full-marginalisation), some variants of biculturalism emerged from the latent class analysis: full-high and full-low integration, which were not sensitive to life domains; and “alternate” acculturation options that were sensitive to life domains, with participants switching from their original culture to the host culture according to the peripheral and central domains. Acculturation options varied across the four samples, with Italians switching more from one culture to another, and Spanish adolescents being more full-high or full-low integrated.},

The purpose of this study was to examine the associations among acculturation, acculturative stress and depressive symptoms in Vietnamese women who migrated to South Korea through marriages. We hypothesized that acculturative stress would serve as a mediator in the relationship between acculturation and depressive symptoms. Our findings from surveys with 217 Vietnamese immigrant women showed that the indirect effect of acculturation on depressive symptoms, mediated through acculturative stress [−.15 (.04)], was significant (bias corrected 95\% confidence interval for the indirect effect = −.25, −.08). Low levels of acculturation increased acculturative stress, which in turn led to the elevated symptoms of depression. Our findings not only illuminate the adaptation processes of international, female migrants but also suggest avenues to protect and promote their mental well-being.},

  Abstract = {The devastating effects of experiencing violence in childhood are seen well into adulthood. This has been particularly difficult to assess among South Asians living in the U.S., due to a lack of disaggregated data on this ethnic group. In a web-based survey administered to a convenience sample of South Asian women living in the U.S. (n = 535), information was gathered on experience/exposure to childhood violence; adult intimate partner violence; and adverse health outcomes, including ever suicide ideation/attempt, experiences of quality of life and body esteem in adulthood. Further, an individual’s acculturation levels were measured specifically looking at cultural identity which was guided by Berry’s biculturalism model. This study found that acculturation status is a key factor with respect to childhood verbal, physical, and sexual abuse, as well as body esteem and an individual’s well-being. These results suggest that acculturation plays a key role for childhood violence, as well as key adult health indicators. The findings in this study, suggest that more research is warranted to better understand the complex relationships between acculturation status and health. While studies of South Asian immigrants have increased substantially, the study on how acculturation influences family violence and health outcomes has lagged behind. The findings in this study will provide guidance for future work in understanding how acculturation can play a key role in addressing the health and well-being of South Asian women in the U.S.},

  Abstract = {Background. Due to the fast development of economies in China and the great needs of professionals in the US, the population of highly educated young Chinese professionals working in high-tech industries has grown very fast in both countries. This population was suggested to have risk of consuming high energy and fat diet in both countries. Objectives. This study aimed to investigate the associations of dietary intake with nutrition knowledge, attitude, dietary self-efficacy and acculturation among Chinese working in high-tech industries in China and in the US. Methods. This study was a cross-sectional self-administered online survey. We studied 925 Chinese aged 20-45 years, who worked in high-tech industries and had at least a bachelor degree in four sub-groups: employees of Chinese companies in China; employees of American companies in China; Chinese-born immigrant in the US; and American-born Chinese in the US. A web-based questionnaire including a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was developed to assess total energy and fat intakes, nutrition knowledge, attitudes, dietary self-efficacy. Four domains of acculturation were assessed among Chinese in the US. Using these data, we compared the four sub-groups and tested the prediction model of dietary intake and BMI. Results. Our results showed that American-born Chinese participants consumed significantly higher energy and fat than the other three groups. Participants in the US had higher nutrition knowledge, attitude and self-efficacy than participants in China. Chinese-born immigrant men in the US had the highest nutrition knowledge and attitude and the lowest prevalence of overweight among the four study groups of men. The study results suggested that preferring Chinese food and Chinese leisure activity are predictors of lower energy and fat intake in Chinese-born immigrants. Conclusions. The Chinese-born immigrants showed significant advantages in nutrition knowledge, attitude, and dietary self-efficacy and had the lowest prevalence of overweight in men. American-born Chinese consumed the highest energy and fat among the four study groups even though their nutrition knowledge, attitude and self-efficacy were high. Future nutrition promotion programs should make use of these cultural and environmental differences when designing theses programs. The web-based survey method can be utilized in future nutrition research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

Study 1 found that for Polish immigrants (n=55) acculturation-contact discrepancies were associated with compromised well-being. Study 2 followed a cohort of international students (n=106) for a period of two academic years. Results suggested that discrepancies in students' acculturation-contact in their first year had harmful consequences for their well-being 1 year later.

Objectives: Using the data from California Health Interview Survey, we test the hypothesis whether acculturation is associated with recreational computer use among Latino adolescents. Methods: We run linear regressions of the weekly time spent on recreational computer use among Latino adolescents, stratified first by gender and then by age group (12-14 and 15-17 years). Years living in the United States and language at home are used as key variables for acculturation. Results: For all four sub-populations, living in the United States for less than 5 years is significantly associated with fewer hours on recreational computer use, compared with those US-born. Among female adolescents, those who lived in the United States for 10 years or more spent fewer hours on recreational computer use than those US-born. Among adolescents under 15, speaking English only and speaking English plus another language are both significantly associated with more hours on recreational computer use, compared with those who speak a non-English language at home. Conclusion: Educators and health professionals should heed the Latino adolescents' possible increase in recreational computer use. © 2012 The Author.},

  Abstract = {Given the assumption that mass media reflect the cultural values of a society, this study investigates the effects of American and Korean mass media on Korean immigrants' acculturation process. Structural equation modeling and hierarchical regression modeling were used to evaluate how exposure to mass media is related to the acculturation process. The survey results from the two different analyses were consistent with each other, in that exposure to American mass media was a significant positive predictor for the acceptance of American cultural values and a significant negative predictor of the affinity for Korean cultural identity. However, exposure to Korean mass media was related to neither immigrant's affinity for Korean cultural identity nor acceptance of American cultural values. Thus, we surmise that even though Korean immigrants are frequently exposed to both American and Korean mass media, they tend to be Americanized instead of bicultural due to the strong effects of the American media.

  Abstract = {The mental health needs of immigrants are becoming increasingly important as the pangeatic meshing of cultures and blending borders continues. The process of acculturation and the stress involved in adapting to the host culture and preserving homeland traditions can have a significant impact on the lives of immigrants and their children (Berry, 2003). Studies have shown that acculturation style, that is, the manner in which one acculturates, can affect physical and mental health in immigrant populations (Hans, 2001). The substantial increase in the numbers of Indian Asian immigrants to the U.S. has been described as one of the most significant demographic developments in decades (Durvasula \& Mylvaganam, 1994). Despite this growing population, few studies have been conducted specifically on the effects of acculturation and acculturative stress in Indian Asian Americans (Saroop, 2003). As the number of Indian Asians seeking psychological services increases so does the need for research on this population (Saroop, 2003. The current study examined acculturative style and its effect on acculturative stress and individual well being in adult Indian Asians living in the United States. A convenience sample of 53 Asian Indians from a church in the Midwest was recruited for this study. The measures used were the Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identity Scale to assess acculturation strategies, the Acculturation Stress Scale for International Students to assess acculturative stress, and the Satisfaction with Life Scale to assess well-being. The results indicate that 3 acculturation strategy did not have an impact on acculturative stress nor was acculturative stress related to life satisfaction. Limitations of the study included the use of a convenience sample and the small size and homogeneity of the sample. The purpose of the study was to broaden the limited pool of research on this population and in so doing provide empirical support for culturally competent clinical practice and increasing culturally specific mental health policies and resources. Continued research on the impact of acculturation processes on mental health in Indian Asians needs to be conducted with larger more varied samples of Indian Asians.}

  Abstract = {Objectives. We sought to determine whether low acculturation among Mexican American caregivers protects their children against asthma. Methods. Data were obtained from an observational study of urban pediatric asthma. Dependent variables were children's diagnosed asthma and total (diagnosed plus possible) asthma. Regression models were controlled for caregivers' level of acculturation, education, marital status, depression, life stress, and social support and children's insurance. Results. Caregivers' level of acculturation was associated with children's diagnosed asthma (P=.025) and total asthma (P=.078) in bivariate analyses. In multivariate models, protective effects of caregivers' level of acculturation were mediated by the other covariates. Independent predictors of increased diagnosed asthma included caregivers' life stress (odds ratio [OR]=1.12, P=.005) and children's insurance, both public (OR=4.71, P=.009) and private (OR=2.87, P=.071). Only caregiver's life stress predicted increased total asthma (OR=1.21, P=.001). Conclusions. The protective effect of caregivers' level of acculturation on diagnosed and total asthma for Mexican American children was mediated by social factors, especially caregivers' life stress. Among acculturation measures, foreign birth was more predictive of disease status than was language use or years in country. Increased acculturation among immigrant groups does not appear to lead to greater asthma risk.},

  Abstract = {Following forced expulsion and campaigns of ethnic cleansing, substantial portions of national communities affected by conflict no longer live within the boundaries of the state. Nevertheless, existing wartime and postwar public opinion research is largely confined to countries directly affected by conflict. As a result, current research may overlook important war-affected populations and processes shaping their opinions. I address this problem by examining the question: does incorporation in settlement countries reduce support for conflict ideology? Examining this question requires new microdata. I examine the results of a large-scale survey of ex-Yugoslavs in Sweden. The findings suggest that incorporation undermines support for conflict ideology by increasing the socioeconomic security and social identity complexity of migrants. This has important implications for multiculturalism policies in the context of the current global migration crisis.}

Results indicate that assimilation in the least disadvantaged neighborhoods can be protective against poor health. Specifically, more assimilated men and women in the lowest disadvantage neighborhoods have a lower likelihood of self-reported poorer health and being overweight, respectively; no link was found in higher disadvantage neighborhoods. Assimilation was not found to be associated with self-reported health for women or BMI for men, regardless of neighborhood disadvantage level. Overall, we find some evidence supporting the hypothesis that the effects of assimilation on health depend on the context in which immigrants experience it.},

The study also examined the demographic, ethnocultural, and psychological factors that could influence subcontinental migrant groups' attitudes towards acculturation and their acculturation strategies. Method: A cross-sectional design was used in which the dependent variables were the four acculturation strategies. Multivariate data analysis was conducted. Pearson's correlation, analysis of variance, and step-wise multiple regression analyses were performed to establish the relationships among the study variables. Results: Integration was the most preferred strategy and marginalisation was the least preferred strategy for all ethnic groups. Acculturation preferences are predicted partly by the adolescents' ethnicity, their ethnic identity, friendship choices, acculturative stress, sense of mastery (self-concept) and gender. The findings provide significant information on the acculturation practices of Indian subcontinental adolescents, including their ethnic identity search and commitment, their psychological well-being and their integration strategies. Conclusions: Educational institutions could benefit from increased awareness of the needs of these culturally diverse groups, especially if this information is incorporated into teacher training materials. The inclusion of intercultural relations courses in the academic curriculum would promote harmonious relations between culturally diverse ethnic groups.}

  Title = {Latinos' experiences in the {US}: {Acculturation}, discrimination, stress, social cohesion and psychiatric disorder},
  Year = {2018},
  Keywords = {\#duplicate-citation-key, P-939},
  Abstract = {Background: Latinos are the largest foreign-born group and one of the fastest growing minority groups in the United States. As such, they will increasingly contribute to the burden of mental and behavioral disorders. Acculturation and other related experiences are associated with the development of mental disorder in US-residing Latinos, however most studies treat Latinos as a homogeneous group. This obscures meaningful between-group differences and hinders the elucidation of potential mechanisms contributing to the association between acculturation and mental health outcomes. Further, despite its importance, acculturation has been measured insufficiently and inconsistently. This is especially problematic due to the complex nature of these constructs. To understand the mechanism by which acculturation impacts mental health, novel methods are needed. Latent variable methods are one such approach that has been recommended as a way to capture nuance of complex constructs such as acculturation. Methods: Data come from the National Latino and Asian American Study, a nationally-representative, cross-sectional survey of 2,554 Latinos in the United States. Results: The six scales of acculturation (English and Spanish language preference and proficiency, ethnic identity) and related experiences (discrimination, acculturative stress, neighborhood context, family context) had good construct validity. No scales achieved full measurement invariance, but some scales were more variant across subgroups than others. Four latent classes of Latinos' acculturative experiences emerged: Positive Experiences (n=1,743, 69\%), Cohesive-Conflict (n=424, 17\%), Marginalized Conflict (n=237, 9\%), and Marginalized (n=137, 5\%). These classes were highly associated with all three categories of DSM-IV disorder: depressive, anxiety, and substance use disorders after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, subethnicity and generational status. The Positive Experiences class had the lowest lifetime prevalence of all three disorders (14.8\%, 13.6\% and 7.1\%, respectively). The class associated with the highest disorder prevalence (34.0\%, 26.6\%, and 22.5\%, respectively) was those Latinos with a Marginalized Conflict experience. After accounting for acculturative experiences, direct associations between subethnicity and generational status and disorder varied. There were no significant direct effects between subethnicity and substance use disorder prevalence, but a strong dose-response relationship of generational status. Conversely, subethnicity was directly related to depressive and anxiety disorder prevalence, but generational status was not. Conclusions: Acculturation and other experiences related to immigrant and minority status in the US are complex constructs and should be treated as such. Latent variable methods help account for measurement variance by subgroup and the unobserved nature of the constructs. Latinos have varied acculturative experiences in the US, which are highly personal and not fully accounted for by observed characteristics such as country of origin.

  Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report on the development of an Arabic language scale for measuring cross-cultural adjustment in the Arab world, predominately the Middle East. It also comments on aspects of psychometric tools and their appropriateness for use in cross-cultural management research. Design/methodology/approach - Black and Stephen's Cross-Cultural Adjustment Scale was translated into Arabic using the method of back-translation and a pilot item-by-item debriefing. It was then administered to 111 Arabic-speaking employees of a single firm. Findings - The Arabic language version yielded high alpha coefficients and a subsequent factor analysis revealed three primary factors of cross-cultural adjustment, namely, Work Adjustment, Interaction Adjustment and General Adjustment, which corresponded closely to the original English version of the scale, with two minor exceptions. Research limitations/implications - The research is confined to the cultural-linguistic context in which it was executed. Practical implications - The findings suggest that an Arabic version of the three-factor scale is useful for measuring adjustment in Arabic-speaking samples and implies the wider generalizability of the cross-cultural adjustment construct. The development of this scale in an important region for migrant labor is highly relevant to practice. Originality/value - An Arabic version of the most widely used cross-cultural adjustment scale is of value to researchers and practitioners. The Muslim sample drawn from the Middle East region also makes the paper highly original. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.}

  Year = {2013},
  Keywords = {\#duplicate-citation-key, P-783},
  Abstract = {Purpose: According to census estimates, Asians are one of the fastest growing immigrant groups in the US, and the fastest growing group among all elderly. This study examines the impact of acculturation, measured as English ability, along with other predictors on health for older Asian Americans. Data Sources: Data from the 2009 American Community Survey and the National Latino and Asian American Study were used to examine large-scale population characteristics of Asian American elderly. Measures: A broad view of health (physical, mental, Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (iADLs)) was examined using items capturing functional disability. Psychological health was examined using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Analytical Methods: Confirmatory factor analysis, logistic regression analysis, and path analysis was conducted. Results: CFA suggests scales are reliable for use. Cross-cultural comparability was found for psychological distress, but not for functional disability. Results indicated that English ability predicted lower disability, but had no relationship to psychological distress. Higher levels of intergenerational family conflict increased distress for Asian elders. Perceived discrimination, which represents a form of social marginalization, emerged as a key mediating variable and was consistently associated with poorer mental health. Conclusion: This study provided key insights into the applicability and measurement invariance of two key measures of health for older Asian Americans. While the measures captured health reasonably well, the results suggest confounds for this population, which may be due to perceptions of disability, language, immigration status, social networks, health insurance status, and access to services. Acculturation is a process involving the individual and the family, and can cut across age groups and generations. Policies should emphasize the development of culturally-specific services for Asian American elders. The study highlights that social workers must engage families across generations and the lifespan when working with Asian elders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

Findings show that trust in government in the new host nation is shaped by individuals' premigratory exposure to democracy during preadult socialization in their countries of origin. Immigrants who were socialized under more democratic regimes exhibit less trust in the national government than do their counterparts socialized under authoritarian systems. We also find a negative effect of acculturation on trust in all levels of government, an effect that is moderated by both premigratory exposure to democracy and by income.}

It is associated with poor work-related well-being and can inhibit full adjustment to the host society. The goal of our study is to examine the impact of perceived overqualification on job satisfaction and career satisfaction among immigrants. Furthermore, we investigated immigrants’ host national identity as a moderator of the impact of perceived overqualification on job satisfaction and career satisfaction. We analysed longitudinal online survey data from 124 Italian and Spanish immigrants who migrated to Germany between 2000 and 2014. Regression analyses show that perceived overqualification is negatively associated with job satisfaction six months later. Furthermore, host national identity moderates the association between perceived overqualification and job satisfaction: low overqualification is beneficial for job satisfaction whereas high overqualification is a threat for job satisfaction, especially for immigrants who identify strongly with the host society. We do not find corresponding direct and moderating effects on career satisfaction. We conclude that indicators of acculturation, such as host national identity, are worth considering in order to understand the impact of person-job misfit on work-related well-being among immigrants.}

The results indicated that participants were more acculturated to their heritage culture compared to the host culture. The majority of Sri Lankan and Indian skilled migrants were moderately acculturated into Australian society, and were most acculturated in the language dimension, followed by the behavior and identity dimensions respectively. Years since migration predicted overall host acculturation but not overall heritage acculturation. While overall heritage acculturation predicted personal wellbeing, overall host acculturation was a stronger predictor. Testing of a mediation model demonstrated that overall host acculturation fully mediated the relationship between years since migration and wellbeing. Further analysis showed that only host identity and language acculturation, and not host behavior acculturation, mediated the relationship between years since migration and wellbeing. Implications of these findings are discussed.}

  Abstract = {This dissertation investigates the impact of immigrant status, acculturation, and ethnic identity on Latino adolescents' academic attitudes and performance. It explores the phenomenon known as the 'immigrant paradox,' whereby early generation adolescents exhibit more positive academic outcomes than their later generation peers, and tests whether the immigrant paradox can be explained via the processes of acculturation, ethnic identity, family obligation, cultural values like familismo, and belief in the American Dream. Using a mixed methods design, the study also investigates how family immigration and education stories impact the belief in the American Dream and educational beliefs and values. The quantitative study uses self-report survey data from 223 Latino 9th graders (and a subset of 135 Dominican 9 th graders) to investigate the presence of the 'immigrant paradox' and the underlying processes which may explain the impact of acculturation on academic outcomes. Findings from this study provide evidence for the 'immigrant paradox' in both the full sample as well as the Dominican subset. Furthermore, family obligation was found to have a significant positive effect on academic attitudes, and both familismo and belief in the American Dream were found to moderate the impact of acculturation on academic outcomes. These findings point to the importance of family processes and cultural values in motivating children of immigrants and later generation peers to succeed academically. The qualitative study continues to explore these relations by reviewing the family immigration and education stories of a subset of the 223 students. Students who reported family members immigrating to the U.S. to improve the lives of the next generation were more likely to believe in the American Dream. Family stories of positive educational experiences were positively related to adolescents' beliefs about the value of education, while family stories of negative peer interactions were negatively related to adolescents' beliefs about the value of education. Family stories of family-related school struggles were significantly related to greater academic efficacy. Findings from the qualitative study illustrate the potential motivational role of family stories on Latino adolescent educational beliefs and values and support the important influence of family factors on academic attitudes found in the quantitative study.

  Abstract = {This study examined the association between measures of acculturation to the US environment including place of birth, and language spoken at home and proportion of life in the US among foreign-born, in relation to the dietary contribution of ultra-processed foods. Ultra-processed foods, as defined by the NOVA food classification system, are formulations of macronutrients (starches, sugars, fats and protein isolates) with little, if any, whole food and often with added flavors, colors, emulsifiers and other cosmetic additives. We studied 14,663 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011–2016, aged 20+ years, who completed a 1-day 24-h dietary recall. Food items were classified using NOVA into ultra-processed or non-ultra-processed foods. Linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, family income, education and race/ ethnicity, showed significant associations between general acculturation measures and dietary contribution of ultra-processed foods. Foreign-born adults consumed less ultra-processed foods than US-born adults (45 vs. 58\%, p {\textless} 0.001). Within foreign-born adults, ultra-processed food consumption increased with English permeation at home from 40\% among individuals speaking non-English languages only to 50\% among those speaking English only (p for linear trend {\textless}0.001). In addition, ultra-processed food consumption increased from 41\% among foreign-born adults who spent less than 30\% of their life in the US to 48\% among those who lived in the US for more than 50\% of their lives (p for linear trend {\textless}0.001). Race/ethnicity emerged as an important effect modifier for the observed associations.},

  Abstract = {As a culturally diverse country, the U.S. hosts over 39 million immigrants who may experience various cultural and linguistic obstacles to receiving quality health care. Considering online sources an important alternative for immigrants to access health information, this study investigates how Chinese immigrants in the U.S. seek health information online. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among Chinese immigrants who currently live in the U.S. to understand how acculturation strategies they use to adapt to the host society influence their Internet-based health information seeking behaviors. Our findings revealed that the language and web sources immigrants choose to use can be predicted by the acculturation strategies they utilize to cope with the new culture. This study serves as a timely and imperative call for further consideration of the role that acculturation plays in determining how immigrants seek health information and utilize the healthcare services of their host society.},

In this study, we consider how interactions among immigrants and U.S.-born within receiving communities contribute to the process of immigrant integration. We emphasize the extent to which immigrants perceive that they are welcome in their social environments and the downstream effects of those perceptions. Drawing on new representative survey data and in-depth interviews with first-generation Mexican and Indian immigrants in the Atlanta and Philadelphia metropolitan areas, we examine what constitutes feeling welcomed and how these perceptions are associated with immigrants’ interest and trust in the U.S.-born and with their civic participation. Our focus on two metropolitan areas with long-standing racialized dynamics, coupled with new waves of immigration, provides insights about the role of welcoming contexts in immigrant integration in the twenty-first century.}

  Abstract = {US Chinese immigrants undergo a transition to increased chronic disease risk commonly attributed to acculturative and dietary changes. Longitudinal data to confirm this are lacking. We examined acculturation and diet over time in 312 Chinese immigrant women in Philadelphia, recruited October 2005 to April 2008 and followed with interviews and dietary recalls until April 2010. Associations were modeled using generalized estimating equations to account for repeated measures over time. Increasing length of US residence was associated with a small ({\textasciitilde}1 \%/year) but significant increase in acculturation score (p {\textless} 0.0001), which in turn was significantly associated with increased energy density of the diet, percent of energy from fat, and sugar intake, and lower dietary moderation score. These findings provide longitudinal evidence that acculturation increases with length of US residence and is accompanied by dietary changes. However, the changes were small enough that their health impact is unclear. Factors besides acculturation that affect immigrant health and that affect the acculturation trajectory itself warrant investigation.},

  Title = {Host land or homeland?: {Civic}-cultural identity and banal integration in {Latvia}.},
  Year = {2017},
  Keywords = {\#duplicate-citation-key, P-858},
  Abstract = {This dissertation challenges conventional approaches in the study of minority integration by looking at the spaces in which integration occurs, rather than at instances of conflict. It develops a framework that considers banal manifestations of social integration in quotidian and national life. Concentrating on the case study of Russian-speakers and ethnic titulars in Latvia, it compares top-down, elite-led discourse on integration with lived interethnic interactions. In many conventional analyses, Latvia is considered a divided society wherein ethnic, linguistic, and cultural cleavages separate ethnic Latvians from the proportionally large population of Russian-speakers 'left behind' when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. This population has been analyzed through immigrant, diaspora, and fifth column frameworks that suggest Russian speakers remain outside of the Latvian state and nation, if not always civically, then certainly culturally. This dissertation argues the frameworks and indicators traditionally used to measure integration do not sufficiently consider integration in everyday experiences, and therefore overlook much of the integration that is occurring on the ground. Rather, banality -- or the lived experiences that fade into the hum of everyday life -- is an indicator of significant interpersonal and socio-national integration that incorporates minorities as active members of the nation. The dissertation considers relevant theories in the study of integration, nationalism, and identity to create frameworks of interpersonal and socio-national banal integration. These capture both person-to-person experiences and minority engagement with society and the state. The dissertation then links the theoretical concept with three critical elements in the Latvian integration debate. First, it notes the disconnect between top-down integration priorities and ground-level realities. Second, it examines banal integration in daily life, looking at interpersonal interactions, public spaces, and civic connections with the state. Finally, the dissertation considers the ways in which minorities engage as embedded members of the Latvian nation, looking at participation in cultural events and national holidays. Theoretically, this dissertation highlights the necessity of prioritizing banal, quotidian experiences over elite-led discourse in the study of integration. Methodologically, it accomplishes this goal through a multi-method approach, using extant document summary and analysis, medium-n survey data, and qualitative ethnography. Empirically, the dissertation pushes back against a narrative of conflict in Latvian and Russian-speaker relations. Indeed, it argues that not only is Latvian society far less divided than it discursively appears, in many cases, minorities see themselves as active members of the Latvian cultural and civic nation, not tangential to it. This dissertation is a dedicated analysis of the Latvian case, but contributes more broadly to the literature on post-Soviet diaspora and migration studies, integration studies, and questions of nationalism and identity in the modern global context.

We examined cross-sectional relationships between acculturation and substance use, socioemotional well-being, and academic achievement. Somali, Latino, and Hmong adolescents in Minnesota provided data as part of the EAT 2010 (Eating and Activity in Teens) cohort study (N = 1,066). Acculturation was based on nativity, language usually spoken at home, and length of residence in the United States. Chi-square, ANOVA, and regression models were used to test for differences in adolescent well-being by acculturation and ethnic group, and interaction terms were added to models to test effect modification by ethnicity. Hmong adolescents had the highest mean acculturation scores (4.4 ± 1.5), whereas Somali adolescents (2.2 ± 1.8) were the least acculturated. Independent of ethnicity, acculturation was positively associated with marijuana (OR: 1.38; CI [1.25, 1.53]) and alcohol use (OR: 1.12; CI [1.02, 1.22]), and was negatively associated with academic achievement, based on grade point average (β = −0.07; CI [−0.12, −0.03]). Interaction effects indicated significant differences by ethnicity only for academic achievement; significant associations between acculturation and academic achievement were evident only for Somali and Latino youth. Prevention programming should include supports for multilingual and multicultural learners and account for cultural assets within immigrant origin families that maintain and nurture protective factors as adolescents acculturate and transition into young adulthood.

  Abstract = {Background. Research on migrant health mostly examines labor migrants, with some attention paid to the trauma faced by refugees. Marriage migrants represent an understudied vulnerable population in the migration and health literature.Objectives. Drawing on a Social Determinants of Health (SDH) approach, we use a large Korean national survey and stratified multivariate regressions to examine the link between migration processes and the self-rated health of Korea's three largest ethnic groups of marriage migrants: Korean-Chinese, Vietnamese, and Han Chinese.Results. We find that post-migration socioeconomic status and several social integration factors are associated with the health of marriage migrants of all three groups. Specifically, having more social relationships with Koreans is associated with good health among marriage migrants, while having more social relationships with co-ethnics is associated with worse health. Marriage migrants' perceived social status of their natal and marital families is a better predictor of their health than more objective measures such as their education attainment and that of their Korean husbands. The post-migration social gradients among all ethnic groups demonstrate a dose-response effect of marital family's social standing on marriage migrants' health, independent of their own education and the social standing of their natal families. Lastly, we find some ethnicity-specific predictors such as the association between higher educational level and worse health status among the Vietnamese. This variability by group suggests a more complex set of SDH occurred during the marriage migration processes than a basic SDH framework would predict.Conclusion. Using a new immigrant destination, South Korea, as an example, we conclude that migration and health policies that reduce ethnicity-specific barriers and offer integration programs in early post-migration stages may offer a pathway to good health among marriage migrants.},

  Abstract = {This study aimed to compare factors related to changes in perceived health status of Han Chinese (traditional Chinese) and Korean-Chinese (Chinese nationals of Korean descent) women after immigration to Korea. During summer 2013, a survey was conducted with 151 Han and 158 Korean-Chinese women married to Korean men. Most of the respondents reported either no changes (82\%) or positive changes (18\%) in their perceived health status after immigration. The results of the multiple logistic regression analyses indicated healthy dietary behavior was related to positive changes in the perceived health status of both groups (odds ratio [OR] = 7.4 for Han Chinese; OR = 14.6 for Korean-Chinese). Among Han Chinese women, the length of residence in Korea and the change in perceived health status showed a negative relation (OR = 0.2). In contrast, their level of acculturation and health perception were positive (OR = 7.5). However, these results did not apply to the Korean-Chinese women. In conclusion, factors related to changes in perceived health status differed between the 2 groups although they shared healthy dietary behaviors as a common factor. Therefore, policies and programs aimed at promoting immigrant women’s health should consider the differences between Han Chinese and Korean-Chinese.}

To explain it we explore a series of possible factors: demographic variables, economic status, and human and social capital characteristics. Three recent immigrant groups are examined: from Western countries, from the former Soviet Union (FSU), and from Ethiopia. These immigrants came to Israel during the last two decades from different societies, following different immigration circumstances and various motives.The findings, based on the 2007 Ruppin survey data, point to the significant impact of the identity as perceived by veteran Israelis on the immigrants' self-identity for the three groups under study. Also, different variables affect each of the immigrant groups. FSU immigrants behaved according to most of our hypotheses, whereas Western and Ethiopian immigrants did not. Findings are discussed in light of the debate on measuring and defining immigrants' identity. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.}

  Abstract = {We examine the access that culturally diverse migrant groups in Australia have to different sources of social support and how this access, or lack thereof, is associated with psychological flourishing and distress. A national online survey was conducted with 1334 migrants in Australia, examining 11 different sources of social support, including family, friends, relationship partner, acquaintances, work colleagues, health professionals, government agencies, community organisations, religious groups, social groups and online groups. We also examined migrants from different cultural groups. All sources of support were significantly associated with mental health, but somewhat differently for the dimensions of distress and flourishing. Flourishing was linked to higher support from all 11 sources, though not for all cultural groups. High psychological distress was linked to lower support only from family, friends, a partner, acquaintances, work colleagues and social groups, and only for some cultural groups. In particular, for distress, there was no link between migrants from Southern Asia and family support, as well as Confucian Asia groups and friend support. Understanding where migrants from different cultural origins draw their support from could help policymakers and support workers improve health and well-being in migrant populations, especially by focusing on sources of support that are linked to lower distress and greater flourishing, as indicated in this study.},

  Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore specific factors associated with Psychology and Criminology career choices for Hispanic and Latino students including: acculturation, psychological distress/family dysfunction, gender, empathy/listening skills, and locus of control. The present study had three sub-hypotheses. The first proposed that participant's who had experienced negative psychological distress/family dysfunction, were more likely to major in Psychology than Criminology. The second sub-hypothesis proposed that Latino men were more likely to choose Criminology, whereas Latino women were more likely to choose psychology due to their increased ability to demonstrate empathy and listening skills. The third sub-hypothesis proposed that participants with an internal locus of control were more likely to enter a psychology degree than a criminology degree. The recruitment included a total of 228 participants. Fifty-five percent of participants were recruited from the Psychology Department at the state university, and the remaining participants were recruited from several programs that support Hispanic and Latino students and/or migrant students. Participants were asked to complete a Demographic Questionnaire, the Bidimensional Acculturation Scale for Hispanics (BAS), the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), the Multi-Dimensional Emotional Empathy Scale, and the Locus of Control Scale. A logistic regression analysis revealed that acculturation and empathy were best predictors of predictive of major choices. Overall, bicultural students are 4.4 times more likely than acculturated students to be Criminology majors. Furthermore, lower empathy scores are significantly associated with a criminology career choice over psychology. For each one unit decrease in empathy score, the likelihood of choosing Criminology major is 5.37 times higher than choosing a Psychology major. Psychological/family distress, gender, and locus of control were hypothesized to be predictors of career choice, but did not significantly contribute to the logistic regression model.

  Abstract = {Over half of pregnant women report anxiety symptoms and these symptoms may be precipitated by stressful experiences. Anxiety rates may be higher in Mexican-American women who experience sociocultural stressors, such as acculturation, acculturative stress and discrimination. However, the role of such stressors on the trajectory of anxiety symptoms across pregnancy is not yet known. Mexican-American women (n = 151) completed surveys across pregnancy about acculturation, acculturative stress, perceived discrimination, and state anxiety. Multilevel modeling found that acculturation (Anglo orientation, b = 0.050, SE = 0.379, t (137.561) = 0.134, p = 0.894; Mexican orientation, b = 0.775, SE = 0.692, t (133.424) = 1.121, p = 0.264) and perceived discrimination (b = −1.259, SE = 0.921, t (137.489) = −1.367, p = 0.174) were not associated with the trajectory of anxiety symptoms. However, acculturative stress, even while controlling for perceived stress, was associated with high levels of anxiety symptoms that were elevated early in pregnancy (b = −0.045, SE = 0.022, t (135.749) = −2, p = 0.047). This work highlights the unique role of acculturative stress in risk for prenatal anxiety in early pregnancy.},

  Abstract = {This paper is based on the narratives of two groups of young Chinese immigrants who have come to Hong Kong for family reunification and who have apparently adjusted well to their new environment. It is argued that the values, beliefs, and ultimate concerns of these young immigrants have been the underlying forces behind their efforts in adjusting to the challenges in a strange land. Of particular importance are contentment and gratitude, a strong family concept, 'face', an urge for knowledge, a sense of crisis, faith in life, and the identity of a marginal man. These themes reflect the importance of cultural values in shaping migration behaviors. The differences found between the two groups also point to the need to understand migration experience in the context of the developmental stage as well as the social, economic and political situations at the time of migration. © 2004 Taylor \& Francis Ltd.}

  Abstract = {The mental health of individuals of Mexican origin may vary as a function of native status (i.e., Mexican born or USA born). Some have reported that Mexican Americans tend to display more depressive symptoms than Mexican immigrants. The present goal was to estimate the associations among acculturation and native status, and explore relative deprivation in the prevalence of depression. Participants included 153 individuals of Mexican origin who completed the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans, the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the Revised Generalized Expectancy for Success Scale, and relative deprivation questions. Analyses indicated women and those scoring low on acculturation were significantly more likely to report depressive symptoms. Participants who felt they had relatively better family happiness than Euro-Americans reported lower depressive symptoms. So participants' sex, acculturation, and relative lack of depressive symptoms allow better understanding of depressive symptoms among these Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants.

However, few studies have focused on the impact of stress or the moderating effects of low acculturation levels among recent immigrants, such as Dominicans. Using the transactional stress model, the present community-based study examines the relationship between discrimination and stress, and whether this association varies by low acculturation levels in a sample of 246 Dominican women. Results indicate a positive relationship between major racist events (e.g., job-related discrimination), everyday discrimination (e.g., not receiving services in a store), and stress levels. Furthermore, low acculturation moderated the impact that discriminatory experiences had on the stress level of Dominican women. Implications for further research on discrimination and stress among Dominican immigrants are discussed. © 2009 Sage Publications.}

  Abstract = {Objectives: Acculturation is a multidimensional process involving changes in behaviour and beliefs. Questionnaires developed to measure acculturation are typically designed for specific ethnic populations and adult experiences. This study developed a questionnaire that measures acculturation among ethnically diverse populations of youth that can be included as a module in population surveys. Methods: Questionnaires measuring acculturation in youth were identified in the literature. The importance of items from the existing questionnaires was determined using a Delphi process and this informed the development of our questionnaire. The questionnaire was then pilot tested using a sample of 248 Canadians aged 18–25 via an online system. Participants identified as East and South East Asian (27.8\%), South Asian (17.7\%) and Black (13.7\%). The majority were 1st (33.5\%) or 2nd generation immigrants (52.0\%). After redundant items were eliminated, exploratory factor analysis grouped items into domains, and, for each domain, internal consistency, and convergent validity with immigrant generation then age at immigration estimated. A subset of participants re-completed the questionnaire for reliability estimation. Results: The literature review yielded 117 articles that used 13 questionnaires with a total of 440 questions. The Delphi process reduced these to 32 questions. Pilot testing occurred in 248 Canadians aged 18–25. Following item reduction, 16 questions in three domains remained: dominant culture, heritage language, and heritage culture. All had good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alphas {\textgreater} .75). The mean dominant domain score increased with immigrant generation (1st generation: 3.69 (95\% CI: 3.49–3.89), 2nd: 4.13 (4.00–4.26), 3rd: 4.40 (4.19– 4.61)), and mean heritage language score was higher among those who immigrated after age 12 than before (p = .0001), indicative of convergent validity. Conclusions: This Bicultural Youth Acculturation Questionnaire has demonstrated validity. It can be incorporated into population health surveys to elucidate the impact of acculturation on health outcomes among bicultural youth. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)}

  Abstract = {To identify and evaluate socio-psychological factors that are associated with differences in substance abuse prevalence between non-acculturated and acculturated Florida youth, we employed t-test and logistic regression to analyze self-reported data from 63,000 middle and high school student participants in the 2004 Florida Youth Substance Abuse Survey. Questionnaire items covered socio-demographics, tobacco, alcohol, and illicit substance use; and perceptions and attitudes toward drug use. The outcome variables were past 30 day use of "any illicit drug." The key independent variable was language used at home (English/Another language). The covariates were 32 socio-psychological factors that are considered risk and protective factors for adolescent drug abuse. Findings support the growing body of evidence suggesting that acculturation status is a strong predictor of substance use among adolescents. This effect may be mediated principally through the family and peer/individual psychosocial domains. The findings may have important implications for the design and implementation of drug prevention programs targeting teenagers. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.},

  Abstract = {Drawing upon Berry's (1980) bi-dimensional model of acculturation and using data from a community-based sample of adults in Miami-Dade, Florida, the current investigation compared various immigrant acculturation profiles in their levels of depressive symptoms and assessed the mediating role of social support in explaining mental health differences across these acculturation profiles. Latent class analysis specified separated, partial separated, bicultural and marginal profiles of acculturation among Latino immigrants. Notably, our findings identified a small, albeit significant, marginal class among Latino immigrants, and both bivariate and multivariate findings demonstrated that those in marginal class reported the poorest mental health. Our findings further revealed that the observed mental health disadvantage among the marginal class relative to other immigrants was due to their disadvantage in family support . Overall, this investigation further underscores the importance of family support as an element of immigrant acculturation experience and mental health. From a policy perspective, social support, specifically family support, is critical for immigrant mental health, and a lack of family support may increase the risk for developing a marginal experience and mental health problems among a growing population of Latino immigrants in the United States.}

  Abstract = {The study examined the acculturation and adaptation of 200 married Turkish immigrants in Toronto, Canada, using self-report questionnaires. As an extension of research from sojourners to immigrants, and from individuals to married couples, marital adaptation was introduced and three facets of adaptation were differentiated: psychological, sociocultural, and marital. The findings support the contention that adaptation is multifaceted. Consistent with stress and coping models, psychological adaptation of married couples was associated with the personality variable of hardiness, social support, acculturation attitudes, and discrimination. On the other hand, in line with social learning perspectives, sociocultural adaptation was mostly related to the variables instrumental in acquiring social skills in the new culture, namely, language proficiency and contact with members of the dominant group. Marital adaptation was mostly associated with marital stressors and marital support. The lack of research on gender differences in the differentiation of adaptation was addressed. This differentiation was clearer in men than in women; there were also different variables associated with the facets of men's and women's adaptation. The effects of socioeconomic status and gender have also been examined. The findings made it evident that Turkish immigrants did not acculturate uniformly. Two groups of Turkish immigrants, working class and professionals were clearly distinguished in their acculturation experiences and adaptation. Gender differences were most apparent in the low socioeconomic status group. Women in general were psychologically more vulnerable than men; the group that faced more risk factors were those women of low socioeconomic status. In terms of acculturation attitudes, Turkish immigrant couples strongly endorsed separation; however, those of high socioeconomic status preferred integration and assimilation to a greater, and separation to a lesser extent than those of low socioeconomic status.}

Multivariable analyses examined the associations between acculturation and health literacy adjusting for demographic and clinical variables. Similar analyses were performed among participants with HbA1c ≥7.0 \% to assess the association between acculturation and diabetes control. Among an insured primarily foreign born Spanish speaking Latino population, with a long residence period in the US and good healthcare utilization, higher levels of acculturation were not associated with dysglycemia. Lower levels of acculturation were associated with worse diabetes control. Health literacy level did not modify these associations.

To assess emotional fit, earlier studies compared minorities’ emotional experience with that of separate samples of 'distant' majority members in their country of residence. We added 'proximal' fit with the emotional experience of majority members in their social environment. Drawing on large random samples of immigrant minority and majority youth in Belgian high schools (N = 2,543), our study aimed (i) to test majority culture exposure and contact as predictors of emotional fit and (ii) to distinguish emotional fit with distal and proximal variants of majority culture. Minorities’ majority culture exposure predicted both distal and proximal emotional fit. In addition, contact with majority peers better predicted proximal fit. Our findings suggest that emotional acculturation is socially grounded in interactions with proximal majority members. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)}

Only recently, however, research has started to directly examine the effect of the intergroup climate on acculturation preferences. In the present research, we aimed to contribute to this new and important line of research by adopting a multilevel approach to examine the effect of the intergroup climate (social context level of analysis) on immigrants’ acculturation preferences (individual level of analysis) over and above individual-level predictors of acculturation preferences. Based on recent cross-sectional survey data from Germany, we examined the acculturation preferences (cultural maintenance and maintenance of intergroup relations) of members of immigrant groups (immigrants from non-Western countries; N individual level = 317) living in different districts in Germany (N district-level = 179). On the social context level, we used the mean prejudice- and acculturation preferences-scores of the German respondents (N = 3,495) as proxies for the intergroup climate within these districts. Results of multilevel path analysis showed that on the context level, a negative intergroup climate (i.e., a higher amount of prejudice of the German respondents within the districts) was related to a stronger desire for cultural maintenance among the immigrants. The potential implications of a hostile intergroup climate for the acculturation process are discussed.}

Despite this growing literature, results have produced inconsistent findings that may be attributable to differences in terms of the instruments used to assess acculturation and enculturation. Utilizing a 3-year longitudinal data set (with 1-year lags between assessments), the present study explored the psychometric properties of the Bicultural Involvement Questionnaire—Short Version (BIQ-S) and the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans II (ARSMA-II) and examined the overlap between changes in these measures as they relate to internalizing and externalizing problem behavior. The present sample consisted of 216 immigrant Latino youth (43\% boys; mean age 13.6 years at baseline; SD = 1.44 years, range 10 to 17). Exploratory structural equation modeling identified factor structures for the BIQ-S and ARSMA-II that diverged from their hypothesized structure. Growth curve models also indicate divergence between the BIQ-S and ARSMA-II in terms of change in acculturation and enculturation processes. Finally, the present findings emphasized that measures of acculturation and enculturation are not equivalent in terms of their effects on internalizing and externalizing problems.}

  Abstract = {According to the 2010 census Caribbean immigrants make up 49\% of the Black immigrant population of the United States, yet there remains a limited amount of acculturation research with Caribbean immigrants. Instead, the literature is dominated by studies conducted with the Asian and Latino immigrant Diasporas highlighting the complex relationship between acculturation and various psychological factors. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between acculturation, ethnic identity, and psychological outcomes in a sample of immigrants of African-Caribbean descent. Using Berry's (1997) theoretical framework for acculturation research, we hypothesized that ethnic identity would mediate the relationship between acculturation and psychological outcomes. A sample of adult, self-identified immigrants of African-Caribbean descent recruited in the Houston metropolitan area completed a survey packet that included a bidimensional measure of acculturation, a measure of ethnic identity, and scales of self-esteem, life satisfaction, and depression. Statistical analyses conducted with PROCESS revealed that ethnic identity did not mediate the relationship between acculturation and psychological outcomes. However, supplemental moderation analysis revealed mainstream orientation leads to more perceived life satisfaction when ethnic identity ranges from moderate to high. Future research should continue to study the process of acculturation in immigrants of African Caribbean descent using qualitative and longitudinal study designs.

  Abstract = {This doctoral study investigates the nature and role of leisure reading in the lives of avid immigrant readers. Guided by hermeneutic phenomenology and conducted by means of surveys and in-depth interviews, it uses a sample of Russian-speaking immigrants in Toronto, Canada, as a case study. The overarching research problem is divided into three research questions (RQ): RQ1: Who are the readers? RQ2: What are the main characteristics of reading behavior and habits of participants after immigration? RQ3: What role does leisure reading play in participants' lives in immigration? Answering RQ1, the study paints demographic and socio-cultural portraits of participants; recreates a variety of contexts shaping their reading; and unfolds their reader histories. In response to RQ2, it traces immediate post-immigration fluctuations in reading behavior; records the most peculiar reading contents; explores participants' self-perceptions as readers; outlines the major areas of post-immigration changes in leisure reading; and presents the analysis of acculturation stress in the area of leisure reading. It is concluded that leisure reading can be a more sensitive indicator of acculturation than more utilitarian measures, because it can open a window to the cultural and psychological intricacies of acculturation. Finally, RQ3 generates a theoretical discussion of the concept of 'the role of reading' and determines the study focus on immigration-specific, emotional and instrumental, roles. Leisure reading is found important in coping with the culture shock; sharing the experience of others and assessing personal immigration paths; re-evaluating the history of the fatherland and gaining a new perspective on the national heritage; stabilizing identity; learning about the new country; improving English-language proficiency; and compensating for the deficiencies of a transitional period. In addition, leisure reading emerges as a powerful force cementing ethnic and transnational reading communities. The study expands the selected acculturation models and theories; introduces clarity to the concepts of the role and appeal of reading; highlights the dual and self-reinforcing function of reading as a measure and a determinant of acculturation. Finally, it presents a systematic examination of the ethnic readership that has escaped the attention of reading researchers in the largest immigrant-receiving countries, Canada and the United States.

  Abstract = {The aim of this research was to examine the link between adhesion to different acculturation ideologies (multiculturalism, citizenship, secularism and assimilation) and group evaluation among Moroccan immigrants in France. We present two studies. In the first study, we found a negative correlation between adhesion to assimilation or secularism and in-group liking: the more immigrants preferred these ideologies, the less they displayed a positive evaluation of Moroccan people. No significant correlation was noticed between citizenship or multiculturalism and in-group liking. In contrast, adhesion to each one of the acculturation ideologies correlated positively with out-group liking. In the second study, we experimentally manipulated the acculturation ideologies and we showed that in-group liking was lower in assimilation and secularism conditions compared to citizenship and multiculturalism conditions. Out-group liking did not differ as a function of the acculturation ideology. The effect of acculturation ideologies on group evaluations was mediated by perception of the legitimacy of the acculturation ideologies. We discuss these results in terms of individual mobility.}

  Abstract = {Globalization has made it easier for people to migrate, thus increasing diversity within organizations. One problem with this migration is that 1st and 2nd generation immigrants may prefer different leadership styles than those of the mainstream culture. The purpose of this survey-based quantitative comparative study was to investigate the effects of acculturation on the work-related cultural values and leadership style preferences of Mexican immigrants living in the United States. The research question that guided this study focused on the differences in work-related cultural values and preferred leadership styles between 2 generations of Mexican immigrants, Mexicans, and U.S.-born Caucasians. Two hundred and forty-five participants completed the survey. The researcher used a Likert-type self-assessing questionnaire adapted from existing instruments to measure the work-related cultural values and preferred leadership styles of two generations of Mexican immigrants, native Mexicans, and U.S.-born Caucasians. Statistical tools, such as correlations, Cronbach's alpha, t-test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to test measurement reliability and to test for differences in the mean scores of the criterion variables among the 4 groups. The researcher found that, in the aggregate, Mexican immigrants did not acculturate to the mainstream values of the United States, 2nd generation Mexican immigrants' scores were similar to those of U.S.-born Caucasians in work-related values, and all groups prefer the servant leadership style. Implications for social change may include raising the awareness of human resource managers of the differences and similarities in values and preferences of their staff, which may help improve the relationships between managers and the employees.

  Abstract = {Few studies have examined the quality of life of immigrants in Greece and its relations to acculturation. This study explored the quality of life, psychological wellbeing and satisfaction with life among Albanian immigrants, Pontic Greeks in comparison to native Greeks. Furthermore, the relationship between quality of life, psychological wellbeing, satisfaction with life and acculturation of Albanian immigrants and Pontic Greeks was investigated. The study was based on 520 participants from broader area of Athens, 58.3\% (303 people: 150 men and 153 women) native Greeks, 21.9\% (114 people: 57 men and 57 women) Albanian immigrants and 19.8\% (103 people: 50 men and 53 women) Pontic Greeks. Quality of life was measured by WHOQOL BREF—while wellbeing was measured with Satisfaction With Life Scale and The Affect Balance Scale. An adapted a version of Vancouver Index of Acculturation was used to assess acculturation of immigrants. The findings indicated three important factors contributed to quality of life and wellbeing of immigrants: ethnicity, heritage dimension of acculturation and gender. Albanian immigrants and Pontic Greeks scored lower on quality of life and satisfaction with life than native Greek.},

  Abstract = {A theoretical model of predictors of refugee economic adaptation was tested using data from a telephone survey of a random sample of Hmong, Somali, and Russian refugees resettled in Minneapolis-St. Paul. The study examined the relative influence of demographic characteristics, flight-related characteristics, host-related characteristics, residency characteristics, acculturation characteristics, and adaptation stresses upon refugees' employment status and estimated earnings. Although previous studies have extensively examined demographic and residency characteristics, the relative influence of the other factors has not been comprehensively investigated. Multivariate analyses indicated that across the different refugee groups, the model explained 34-44\% of the variance in employment status and 12-26\% of the variance in estimated earnings. Consistent with previous findings, demographic characteristics, in particular, education, gender, and household composition, had the largest effects on the indicators of economic adaptation. The remaining factors had relatively small effects. The implications for refugee resettlement theory, policy, practice, and future research are discussed in light of these and previous findings.

Focus is given to demographic variables (age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, and education), health-related variables (chronic medical condition and self-rated health), immigration-related variables (time in the U.S. and acculturation), and family-related variables (family network and family solidarity). Cross-sectional study. Data were drawn from 2551 participants in the 2015 Asian American Quality of Life Survey (aged 18–98). Participants were asked to indicate whether they would be willing to use a nursing home in the future. An affirmative response indicated a personal willingness to use a nursing home. Approximately 38\% of the sample demonstrated willingness to use a nursing home. Higher odds for willingness were observed among those with advanced age, female gender, Korean ethnicity (compared with Chinese), better education, presence of a chronic medical condition, longer years of residence in the U.S., and lower levels of family solidarity. Reflecting the current trend of an increase in racial/ethnic minorities in nursing homes, a substantial proportion of the present sample of Asian Americans demonstrated willingness to use a nursing home. Findings on the factors associated with willingness provide implications for policies and services to respond to the long-term care needs of this emerging population.},

The theoretical six-factor structure for the AMAS-JP and two-factor structure for the MEIM-JP was consistent with the literature. The subscales of the AMAS and MEIM showed expected patterns of correlation with each other and with additional variables (i.e., number of years in the United States), providing evidence for construct validity. Cronbach’s alpha reflected high levels of reliability for both scales.

The sample consisted of 94 Chinese immigrant adolescents from grades 7-12 in Waterloo Region in and the metropolitan Toronto area of Ontario, Canada. Acculturation was measured by a questionnaire. Literacy skills, including vocabulary, reading fluency, and reading comprehension, were assessed individually using standardized tests. Hierarchical regression analyses reveal that degrees of acculturation to Canadian culture positively predicted English literacy skills after controlling for length of residence in Canada. Interestingly, acculturation explained unique variance in reading beyond variables in the simple view of reading, suggesting the independent contribution of sociocultural factors to second- language reading in adolescent English learners. © 2014 International Reading Association.}

Using epidemiological research methods, we examined the prevalence of nervios and associated risk factors, including drug and alcohol use, acculturation, and housing conditions in a population-based study of farm worker families in Mendota, CA (the MICASA Study). A household enumeration procedure was used for sampling, and 843 individuals were interviewed in 2006–2007. In this analysis, we present data on 422 men, 381 accompanied (family) males and 41 unaccompanied males. The prevalence of nervios was 22 \%, with no difference in prevalence by household status. Low family incomes, drug use, medium/high acculturation, and poor housing conditions were associated with increased odds of nervios. Self-reported poor/fair health, depressive symptoms, and high perceived stress were also associated with nervios. Since nervios has been shown to be a clinical indicator of psychiatric vulnerability among Latinos, this analysis furthers public health goals of reducing health disparities.},

A sample of 131 healthy young adults aged between 18 and 24 years old, with a Turkish or Moroccan background was recruited using snowball sampling. Data on acculturation, internalizing and externalizing problems, beliefs about psychological problems, attributions of psychological problems and barriers to care were collected and analyzed using Latent Class Analysis and multinomial logistic regression. Three acculturation classes were identified in moderately to highly educated, healthy Turkish or Moroccan young adults: integration, separation and diffusion. None of the participants in the sample were marginalized or assimilated. Young adults reporting diffuse acculturation reported more internalizing and externalizing problems than those who were integrated or separated. Separated young adults reported experiencing more practical barriers to care than integrated young adults. Further research with a larger sample, including young adult migrants using mental health services, is required to improve our understanding of acculturation, psychological problems and barriers to care in this population. Including experiences of discrimination in the model might improve our understanding of the relationship between different forms of acculturation and psychological problems.},

  Abstract = {The present study examined acculturation among Asian-Indians, residing in the United States and Canada, and explored: (1) whether acculturation can predict reporting of domestic violence, (2) how acculturation between Asian-Indians immigrants and US/Canadian born Asian-Indians is related to reporting domestic violence, and (3) how traditional practices such as arranged marriage and/or dowry influence the relationship between acculturation and domestic violence. Participants (N=100) were administered the Acculturation Scale for Asian Indians (ASAI; Parekh, 2000) and the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2; Straus, 1996). Results demonstrated that acculturation was not found to be a good predictor of physical assault or psychological aggression and that acculturation was not significantly related to physical assault or psychological aggression. Significant results were found for birth status and acculturation. Traditional arranged marriage and dowry could not be addressed due to the low number of participants that could be classified into these variables. Therefore, a qualitative analysis was conducted. Factors influencing these results and limitations of the present study were offered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

  Abstract = {The number of Korean immigrants in Manitoba increased significantly in a decade since the introduction of the Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program (PNP). Recent statistics indicate that Manitoba attracted over 13,000 immigrants in 2009, many coming from Korea. The purpose of this research is to understand and measure the integration experiences of Korean immigrants in Manitoba in terms of their social, political, education and employment domains. The primary theory used in this research is social capital. Theories of acculturation, ethnic economy, power and stratification are also used to situate my research. Data was collected using mixed methods comprising a survey of 260 Korean Canadians living in Winnipeg and qualitative interviews with 12 respondents. The analysis shows, among other things, high levels of racism felt by Korean immigrants in Winnipeg. While this perception and daily encounter of discrimination in the community would impede Korean immigrants’ integration into Canada, there also is a strong will to succeed in the community through accessing existing social capital and a willingness to invest in social capital. The contributions made in the development and operationalization of social capital in terms of willingness to invest and social capital mindset are documented. Several program ideas are offered for policy-makers and future research areas have been identified. The development of a political engagement index provides justification for observations made by the social capital theory and immigrant integration literature.}

  Abstract = {Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) may have adverse effects on both mother and child. The aims were to determine the prevalence of postpartum depressive symptoms, PPDS, identify associations with ethnicity and with the level of social integration. Method: Population-based, prospective cohort study of 643 pregnant women (58\% ethnic minorities) attending primary antenatal care in Oslo. Questionnaires regarding demographics and health issues were collected through interviews. PPDS was defined as a sum score ≥ 10 by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, used as the main outcome in logistic regression analyses, first with ethnicity, second with level of integration as main explanatory factors. Results: The prevalence of PPDS was higher in ethnic minorities 12.7\% (95\% CI: 9.31–16.09) than in Western Europeans 4.8\% (2.26–7.34). Adverse life events, lack of social support and depressive symptoms during the index pregnancy were other significant risk factors. Western European with PPDS were more likely to have had depressive symptoms also during pregnancy than women from ethnic minorities (72.2\% versus 33.3\%, p = 0.041). When replacing ethnicity with integration, a low level of integration was independently associated with PPDS (2.1 (1.11–3.95)). Limitations: Cases with PPDS were limited. Heterogeneity in the ethnic groups is a concern. Conclusion: Both point prevalence and new onset of PPDS was higher among ethnic minorities than among Western Europeans. Low level of integration was associated with PPDS. Our findings suggest that clinicians should be aware of the increased risk of new cases of PPDS among ethnic minorities compared to Western European women and offer evidence-based care accordingly.},

After controlling for background factors associated with attitudes toward homosexuality, we find evidence of acculturation, whereby attitudes become more tolerant—and more typical of those prevalent in Western Europe—with longer residency in this region. This study builds on existing research into cross-national differences in attitudes toward homosexuality and extends the existing North American literature on acculturation to a European context.}

  Abstract = {Professional Chinese immigrants (PCIs) are expected to substantially contribute to the relief of skills shortage and the bolstering of Australia’s economic and social development. However, they have encountered many adjustment difficulties arising from cultural and social differences after entering into the Australian workplace. There is a dearth of research to shed light on the adaptation of PCIs in Australia. To bridge this gap, this paper investigates PCIs’ acculturation preference and explores the predictors of each acculturation attitude. Our survey of a sample of 220 PCIs revealed that PCIs have a predominant preference to maintain their home culture, whereas logistic regressions revealed that length of residence in the host country, English proficiency, perceived social support at work and interdependent self-construal could predict the acculturation choices among PCIs. This study provides valuable information for managers and organizations in developing effective acculturation programs to assist immigrant employees with adaptation to a new workplace.}

Existing literature indicates that elderly Korean immigrants may experience higher levels of depression than other racial ethnic group elders. The purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate factors that influence depression among older Korean immigrants in Toronto. A total of 148 participants, ages 60 years or older (mean age = 74.01, SD = 8.24), completed face-to-face interviews in Korean language. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted by adding variables in three steps: 1) demographic variables; 2) acculturation variables (years of immigration and English proficiency); and 3) social determinants (social integration variables, physical health, and financial satisfaction). Results showed that acculturation factors were not associated with depression. Instead, social determinants variables, including lower physical health status and lower financial status, living alone, and lower level of social activity, predicted higher level of depressive symptoms, along with lower education. The final regression model explained about 37\% of variance of depression in the sample. These results suggest that social determinants, not acculturation, are important factors explaining the levels of depression in Korean immigrant elders living in a metropolitan city in Canada. Implications for practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

  Abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the United States (US). African-descent populations bear a disproportionate burden of CVD risk factors. With the increase in the number of West African immigrants (WAIs) to the US over the past decades, it is imperative to specifically study this new and substantial subset of the African-descent population and how acculturation impacts their CVD risk. The Afro-Cardiac study, a community-based cross-sectional study of adult WAIs in the Baltimore–Washington metropolis. Guided by the PRECEDE–PROCEED model, we used a modification of the World Health Organization Steps survey to collect data on demographics, socioeconomic status, migration-related factors and behaviors. We obtained physical, biochemical, acculturation measurements as well as a socio-demographic and health history. Our study provides critical data on the CVD risk of WAIs. The framework used is valuable for future epidemiological studies addressing CVD risk and acculturation among immigrants.},

  Abstract = {Self-efficacy is a key personal resource in individual development and successful adaptation, and it can serve innumerable purposes. Our study investigated levels and change rates in self-efficacy among newcomer and more experienced immigrant adolescents and tested whether acculturation-related and developmental variables explained inter-individual differences in self-efficacy in both groups. The sample comprised 480 newcomer (59\% female, 15.8 years old) and 483 experienced (55\% female, 15.9 years old) immigrant adolescents, assessed in four annual waves. Latent growth curve models showed newcomers to have lower levels and more pronounced increases of self-efficacy as compared to experienced immigrant adolescents. Both acculturation-related and developmental variables predicted self-efficacy. The results highlight the need for focusing on immigration stages and support the notion of combining developmental and acculturative factors in the study of immigrant adolescents.},

  Abstract = {Given the considerable variability in drinking practices among Asian American groups, the generalizations that suggest an increase in their alcohol use associated with acculturation need to be questioned. Also, the experience of children of immigrants growing up in the United States may be much more complex than a focus on acculturation can capture. Informed by the theory of segmented assimilation, this study addresses two research questions: 1) Is acculturation associated with alcohol use of Korean American adolescents? and 2) What other social, economic, and cultural forces influence their alcohol use? Survey data collected from 202 adolescents of Korean descent in Southern California were used. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that acculturation was not a significant predictor of most measures of alcohol use, while peer influence, scholastic achievement/aspirations, and current smoking were predictive. Gender and social class were unrelated to drinking. Findings suggest focusing research on an integrative approach to understanding drinking in complex social, economic, and social contexts may be useful.}

I use data from a 2009-2010 Internet survey into which I incorporated country-contextual characteristics. The results of multivariate analyses show that a social integration combining duration of residence abroad and local citizenship enhances religio-ethnic identification. Another measure of integration, social networks, deters group behaviors. All measures of general integration inhibit attachment to the home country, whereas religio-ethnic acculturation is largely insignificant for transnationalism. The religiosity of the new country does not influence immigrants' religio-ethnic patterns or homeland attachment. Insofar as group size is a significant determinant of particularistic behaviors, it weakens them. The more policy-based opportunities newcomers receive, the more they dissociate from group behaviors and homeland ties. Irrespective of individual and contextual factors, living in the United States encourages group affiliation more than living in Europe does. The results are discussed in reference to four working hypotheses-marginalization, integration, assimilation, and separation-and from a U.S.-European comparative perspective.}

  Abstract = {This study explores the relationships between acculturation, transnational ties, and depressive symptoms in a community sample of Vietnamese immigrants and descendants. Research indicates that immigration-related factors such as acculturation (Berry, 1980; Suinn, 2010) and transnational ties (Murphy \& Mahalingam, 2004) are important in understanding elevated depressive symptoms in Vietnamese immigrants (Leung, Cheung, \& Cheung, 2010) and other immigrant populations. Empirical research, however, has yet to examine acculturation, transnational ties, and depressive symptoms concomitantly. To fill this gap, the current study employed both a mediation and a moderation framework to separately examine whether transnational ties mediated or moderated the relationships between dimensions of acculturation and depressive symptoms. The sample comprised of pilot study (N = 37) and dissertation study (N = 107) participants who were recruited through convenience and snowball sampling in the Southwest and Midwest regions of the United States. Participants completed surveys comprised of demographic information, the Asian American Multidimensional Acculturation Scale (AAMAS; Chung, Kim, \& Abreu, 2004), the Transnationalism Scale (TS; Murphy \& Mahalingam, 2004), and the Center for Epidemiological Study of Depression scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977). No mediation effects were found for transnational ties as a mediator between the associations of acculturation dimensions with depressive symptoms. Significant moderation effects were found for the Financial and Commercial Ties aspect of transnational ties in moderating the relationship between acculturation to the Vietnamese culture and depressive symptoms. As acculturation to the Vietnamese culture increased, levels of depressive symptoms decreased, and the decrease in depressive symptoms was more pronounced for Vietnamese immigrants who reported higher levels of Financial and Commercial Ties compared to those who reported lower levels. When acculturation to the Vietnamese culture was high, participants with high Financial and Commercial Ties had lower depressive symptoms than those with the same level of acculturation but engaged in low Financial and Commercial Ties. However, for participants with low identification with the Vietnamese culture but engaged in high Financial and Commercial Ties, their depressive symptoms were higher than those with the same low identification with the Vietnamese culture but engaged in low Financial and Commercial Ties.

  Abstract = {This work adopts a perspective that construes acculturation as a dynamic intergroup process, and social contact with members of the new community as a key mechanism underlying cultural adaptation. We argue that migrants’ initial self-reported mainstream cultural orientation constitutes an important antecedent of early social participation in the new community. Results from two longitudinal studies of newly arrived international students ( N = 98 and N = 60) show that more positive initial mainstream cultural orientations prospectively predict higher social participation, specifically in the mainstream group, over the following months. This relation held after controlling for important alternative predictors, namely, extraversion/shyness, mainstream language proficiency, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia, a physiological index of social engagement capacity. These studies focus on the very initial stages of the temporal dynamics of acculturation, contribute to bridging research on acculturation and on intergroup relations, and establish a link between cultural orientations, a subjective attitudinal construct, and concrete social engagement behaviors.},

Previous literature tends to highlight the sufferings and difficulties that female refugees experience as they leave their homelands and settle in a new country. Few studies have been directed toward the political dimension of refugee life. The empirical results show that North Korean women defectors hold generally participatory attitudes toward politics and mostly liberal opinions on policy issues. Furthermore, among the socio-demographic variables, age and marital status are generally influential in the intention of political participation among the North Korean women defectors. Among the political attitudinal variables, attitude toward environmental policy consistently affects political participation intention. With respect to defector-specific variables, satisfaction with life in South Korea is influential, whereas cultural adaptation is not.}

  Abstract = {In the current study, 226 international students attending Florida International University responded to an Web-based questionnaire that assessed self-reported scores for: acculturation, acculturative stress, alcohol use patterns, perceived peer alcohol use, and perceived injunctive social norms for alcohol use. The purpose of the study was to evaluate structural relations among this set of variables using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) via AMOS 17.0. The results of SEM analyses documented acceptable fit of a model which hypothesized that relations between acculturation and alcohol use variables are mediated partially by acculturative stress, perceived peer alcohol use, and perceived injunctive social norms. While significant path coefficients were documented for paths between (a) acculturation and acculturative stress and (b) acculturative stress and alcohol use, the coefficients had negative signs, contrary to existing studies investigating these relations among immigrant youth. While paths between (a) perceived peer alcohol use or (b) perceived injunctive social norms and participants’ alcohol use were significant, path coefficients between acculturation and either (a) perceived peer alcohol use or (b) perceived injunctive social norms were not statistically significant. In addition, multiple-group comparisons suggested that social support had a significant moderating influence on several significant paths in the structural model. Specifically, international students reporting higher social support reported lower scores for acculturative stress and alcohol use, in contrast to their counterparts who reported lower scores for social support.

The authors suggest that Motivation for Cultural Maintenance (MCM) and Motivation for Cultural Exploration (MCE) influence acculturation behaviors of immigrants and that these acculturation behaviors, in turn, impact psychological and sociocultural adaptation. The present research investigates a dual-process model based on the relationships between these novel motivations, acculturation behavior of connections with ethnic/national peers, and psychological and sociocultural adaptation in a New Zealand immigrant sample (N = 280, 64.6\% female, M age = 39 years). Results from structural equation modeling largely support the proposed dual-process model and demonstrate that the novel motivations have predictive power. MCM predicted psychological adaptation through ethnic peer connections, whereas MCE and national peer connections predicted sociocultural adaptation directly. Implications of the findings and how the proposed dual-process model can contribute to the acculturation literature are discussed.}

The purpose of this study was to examine whether occupational physical activity, acculturation, familism, and norms held by family and friends are associated with three types of PA: vigorous and moderate leisure-time physical activity (LTPA), and resistance training. Interviews were conducted with 418 Dominican women. We assessed self-reported PA using standardized measures. Data were collected between July 2010 and July 2012 in New York City. Most women reported no vigorous LTPA or resistance training (74.5 and 73.1 \%, respectively); about half (52.1 \%) reported no moderate LTPA. After adjusting for sociodemographic factors, occupational physical activities were associated with greater LTPA. Acculturation was not associated with any outcome. Positive family norms about exercise were associated with increased LTPA and resistance training. Family norms may play a critical role in PA and should be included in programs to increase PA among Latina women.},

  Abstract = {Purpose: The extent to which immigrant-specific factors influence the intergenerational transmission of family violence is unknown. The objectives of this paper are to examine the associations between immigrant generational status (IGS), child maltreatment (CM), intimate partner violence (IPV) and acculturation (i.e., the extent to which an individual adopts the values, language and attitudes of a new culture). Methods: The sample was drawn from wave two of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC; n = 34,653), a nationally representative survey of United States (US) residents aged 20 years and older. Logistic regression was used to estimate the associations between IGS, CM history, IPV, and acculturation. Results: Compared to 3rd generation (or later) respondents, 1st generation immigrants were less likely to report a history of sexual (AOR = 0.74, CI0.95 = 0.62, 0.90) and emotional abuse (AOR = 0.69, CI0.95 = 0.55, 0.87), but were more likely to report physical neglect (AOR = 1.30, CI0.95 = 1.11, 1.52). After adjusting for covariates, IGS was not associated with IPV among respondents with or without a CM history. Among those without a CM history, highly acculturated 1st generation immigrants (AOR = 1.07, CI0.95 = 1.01, 1.13) were more likely to report perpetrating IPV, with highly acculturated 3rd generation respondents having lower odds of reporting IPV perpetration (AOR = 0.93, CI0.95 = 0.88–1.00). Conclusion: IGS and acculturation are important factors in CM and IPV. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the influence of IGS, recency of immigration, acculturation and acculturative stress on the experiences and relationship between CM and IPV.

  Abstract = {With the growth of immigrant populations and the increasing awareness and appreciation for the cultural diversity in the U.S., the present study assessed a model of acculturation with a sample of Korean American older adults. We addressed a bidimensional model of acculturation, considering both orientations toward home and host cultures, and assessed the relevance of Berry's four-cell typology of acculturation (integration, assimilation, separation, and marginalization). Based on the unique characteristics of the present sample, including that they were all born in Korea and had been exposed to their home culture for a substantial amount of time, we hypothesized that their orientation towards original culture would be strong and that simple application of Berry's four-cell typology would not be relevant. As expected, scores on Korean orientation were distributed toward the high end of the scale, suggesting a high level of familiarity and adherence to the original culture; scores on American orientation were correspondingly low. Cluster analysis showed that a two-cluster model was an optimal group classification in the sample used in this investigation. The groups were identified as "integrated group" and "separated group." Compared to the separated group, integrated group was more likely to be younger, married, and educated. More years of residence in the U.S. and better physical and mental health were observed among those who were integrated. The findings call attention to the needs to consider the unique nature of immigrant samples in order to adequately apply the acculturation typologies. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}

The canonical view is that intermarriage with the native-born White population represents a pathway to assimilation that varies over geographic space in response to uneven marital opportunities. Using data on past-year marriage from the 2009–2014 American Community Survey, the authors demonstrate high rates of intermarriage among Hispanics. The analyses identify whether Hispanics marry coethnics, non-co-ethnic Hispanics, non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, or other minorities. The authors highlight variation by race, nativity, and socioeconomic status and reveal that Hispanics living in new immigrant destinations are more likely to intermarry than those living in traditional Hispanic gateways. Indeed, the higher out-marriage in new destinations disappears when the demographic context of reception is taken into account. The analysis underscores that patterns of marital assimilation among Hispanics are neither monolithic nor expressed uniformly across geographic space.}

  Abstract = {Little empirical research has been conducted on Filipinos even though they are the second largest Asian group in the United States. Because the Philippines is the second largest source of immigrants to the United States, studying Filipinos' processes of acculturation is important as acculturation can result in Filipinos experiencing intergenerational conflict, marital discord, adjustment disorders, racism, and shifts in traditional gender roles. Because female ethnic minorities are doubly stigmatized for their race as well as their gender, this study investigated aspects of the Filipina experience. More precisely, Filipinas' level of acculturation was examined in relation to their attitudes toward women's gender roles. One hundred twenty-one Filipinas from the San Francisco Bay Area completed a demographic questionnaire, the Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identity Acculturation Scale (SL-ASIA) that measures behavioral acculturation, the Asian Values Scale (AVS) that measures adherence to Asian values, the Sex Role Orientation Scale (SRO) that measures attitudes toward women's roles, and 2 open-ended questions. Hypotheses were tested using Pearson's r correlations and a stepwise regression. Results indicated that adherence to Asian values and participants' age at immigration to the United States were significant predictors of attitudes toward women's roles. Both behavioral acculturation and adherence to Asian values were significantly correlated with attitudes toward women's roles. In addition, participants who were more behaviorally acculturated were significantly less likely to adhere to Asian values. Furthermore, participants were significantly more likely to have nontraditional attitudes toward women's roles if they had high incomes, were more educated, spoke more English at home, and were born in the United States. Limitations of this study and implications for future research are also discussed.}

  Keywords = {\#duplicate-citation-key, P-524},
  Abstract = {Obesity has been identified as a chronic disease in immigrant minority populations, contributing to an increased risk of high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and other chronic diseases. Prior to this study, it was unknown whether immigrant Nigerian children and adolescents aged 9 to 14 years are at higher risk for obesity as a result of acculturation after migrating to the United States. The purpose of this study, guided by the social cognitive theory, was to assess the risk factors that lead to increased childhood obesity in this at-risk population. Data were collected from 163 participants through a cross-sectional quantitative design involving the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System questionnaires, the body-mass index scale, and Stephenson's Multi-Group Acculturation Scale. Participants were recruited through flyers in a public setting. Descriptive statistics and multiple regression were used in the data analysis. The results indicated that multiple factors are responsible for high rates of obesity in this at-risk population, with results showing significant relationships between obesity and age ( p = .002), employment (p = .005), duration of residence in the United States (p {\textless} .0005), and dominant society immersion (p = .001). Recommendations include developing community-based education programs and policies that support healthy lifestyles and conducting further research that increases the scope of study. This study has implications for positive social change in that it may increase awareness of the value of exercise and healthier eating patterns in the Nigerian community and may support the Healthy People 2020 goal of improving life expectancy and reducing obesity in at-risk populations.}

  Abstract = {Southeast Asian youth are disproportionately represented in the juvenile justice system, and yet little is known about the correlates of their delinquency. Predicated upon segmented assimilation theory, the aims of this study were (1) to examine the relationship between linguistic acculturation and risk behaviors and (2) to investigate neighborhood effects on risk behaviors among a sample of 153 at-risk Southeast Asian youth and young adults recruited from the East Bay Area near San Francisco, California. Exploratory factor analysis from estimated Census data derived neighborhood constructs for concentrated disadvantage and immigrant concentration. A series of binary logistic regression models suggested that linguistic acculturation, neighborhood disadvantage, and immigrant concentration were not related to violence perpetration, arrest, or gang association. Males and those who had dropped out of school were more likely to report acts that are associated with delinquency. Findings suggest that scholars and policymakers should continue to use disaggregated ethnic data to implement culturally competent practices that are reflective of the respective groups’ cultural backgrounds and migration histories. Implications for further research and practice among children of Southeast Asian immigrants are discussed.}

  Abstract = {As the number of older Asian immigrants grows in the U.S., attention to their mental health disparities and mental health care has been increasing. This study aims to identify differences among five ethnic subgroups (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Filipino, and Vietnamese) of older Asian immigrants in California and to examine predictors of mental health service utilization within each ethnic subgroup. The Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations (BMVP) was used to guide the secondary data analysis of a sample of 3,453 older Asian immigrants from the 2009, 2011-2012, and 2013 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS). ANOVA and chi square tests were used to examine group differences and logistic and linear regression analyses were performed to examine predictors of mental health service use and the frequency of mental health service use, respectively. The older Asian immigrant samples were not homogeneous. The Japanese and Filipino samples had better socioeconomic status and higher level of acculturation than others. The Korean sample had the lowest level of mental distress and least use of mental health services. Help-seeking patterns regarding mental health care differed across subgroups. Decreasing age (Chinese and Japanese), female (Vietnamese), not being married (Korean), lower education (Japanese), decreasing perceived safety (Vietnamese), higher levels of mental distress (all), and having perceived need (all) were associated with an increasing likelihood of using mental health services. Not being married (Korean), higher levels of acculturation (Filipino), lower levels of neighborhood cohesion (Korean and Vietnamese), higher levels of perceived safety (Korean) and lower levels of perceived safety (Vietnamese), higher levels of mental distress (Korean and Filipino), and having perceived need (all) were related to more visits for mental health services. Mental health seeking patterns differed by ethnicity within the older Asian immigrant sample. Findings highlight the necessity of cultural competency services and programs for each Asian ethnicity.

The 2009–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey enrolled 592 Mexican American immigrants and 2391 U.S.-born, non-Hispanic whites. Predictor variables included Mexican American ethnicity and a validated Acculturation Index comprised of language spoken at home, interview language, and proportion of life residing in the U.S. The mediator variables were depressive symptoms and log10 transformed C-reactive protein. Compared to U.S.-born, non-Hispanic whites, Mexican American immigrants reported poorer SRH. Mexican American immigrant status was also indirectly associated with worse SRH via greater C- reactive protein. Among Mexican American immigrants, greater acculturation was associated with better SRH. Poorer SRH among Mexican American immigrants may be partially attributable to greater inflammation. However, Mexican American immigrants with higher levels of acculturation report better SRH.},

Using 24-hour dietary recall data from the continuous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey pooled across multiple years from 1999/00 through 2009/10, we developed and tested the validity of the “Food Similarity Index” (FSI), which indicates the similarity of the foods consumed by individuals to the foods most commonly consumed by same-aged U.S-born persons of all racial/ethnic groups. We demonstrate its utility here for children and adults of four racial-ethnic groups. FSI was positively associated with the consumption of common American foods and negatively associated with eating Hispanic and Asian foods. In addition, FSI was associated with generational status among all racial/ethnic groups and duration of U.S. residence among Hispanics. FSI was also negatively associated with the Healthy Eating Index 2010. The FSI enables researchers to compare immigrants’ dietary patterns over generations and across groups. It can be used to study how dietary acculturation shapes health risk factors and diseases.},

  Abstract = {This study investigated how the dimensions of heritage culture and mainstream culture identification, and four dimensions of acculturation, namely integration, assimilation, separation, and marginalization, are associated with the mental health and personality characteristics of first-generation Greek-Americans (including Greek-speaking Cypriots). In order to measure personality and psychopathology the MMPI-2-RF RC scales were utilized. This study was significant in its conceptualization of acculturation. The use of the RC scales has rarely been found, and it is the first time it is being employed with regard to a Greek-American community sample of first generation immigrants. Results indicated that lower mainstream-culture identification was associated with higher scores on Demoralization (RCd), Somatic Complaints (RC1), Cynicism (RC3), Ideas of Persecution (RC6), and Aberrant Behaviors (RC8); and lower heritage-culture identification was associated with higher scores on Somatic Complaints (RC1) to the direction of psychopathology. Individuals testing in the Separated category, that is, who continued to identify more with their heritage culture and less with their new (mainstream) culture experienced more somatic problems. The performance of the sample was in line with prior research, and the findings of this study are consistent with previous studies that found different levels of acculturation to have differential impact on the MMPI-2-RF performance, and studies that found higher identification with both mainstream culture and heritage culture were associated with more favorable mental health outcomes. Findings supported the premise that both mainstream and heritage cultures offer benefits for people living in and/or experiencing multiple cultures. In addition, the findings of this study indicated support for the bidimentional model of acculturation as most participants had a high identification with both mainstream and heritage cultures.

Four hundred and ninety-nine Spaniards and 500 Romanians participated in a survey. The sampling of Spaniards was multistage random and the sampling of Romanians was by quota. The results confirm our predictions. Romanians who are less prejudiced against Spaniards prefer assimilation in public areas and integration in private areas. Romanians who are more prejudiced against Spaniards prefer integration in public areas and separation in private areas. Spaniards who are less prejudiced against Romanians prefer integration in both public and private areas.

  Abstract = {Objectives: This study examined the potential influence of coping resources at individual (sense of mastery), family (spousal and family support, children's filial piety), and community levels (community cohesion) on the mental health (depression, anxiety) of U.S. Chinese older adults. Methods: The data were derived from the Population Study of Chinese Elderly in Chicago (N= 3,159). Negative binomial regressions were performed to predict depression and anxiety, respectively, by entering the three sets of coping resources separately and jointly, controlling for socio-demographic and acculturation variables. Results: Stronger sense of mastery and greater perception of children's filial piety were associated with better mental health outcomes. Spousal support was not associated with any mental health outomes, and family support was actually assciated with greater depression and anxiety. Stronger community cohesion was associated with fewer depressive symptoms but greater anxiety. Conclusion: Older immigrants’ sense of control and perception that children adhere to traditional family norms are important mental health protective factors. Whereas depending on families for support may compromise their well-being, community cohesion could be a double-edged sword for their mental health. Future studies shall further disentangle the associations among sense of mastery, reliance on family and ethnic enclaves for support, and older immigrants’ well-being.},

Principal component analysis revealed that all variables loaded substantially across six components for acculturation patterns and religious factors, which are: 'traditionalist behaviours', 'traditionalist beliefs', 'assimilationist behaviours', 'integrationist behaviours', 'religious beliefs', and 'religious behaviours'. Two new distinct subscales emerged from the adapted MASPAD for assessing religious beliefs and behaviours, which is characteristic of a multidimensional factor structure for acculturation scales.

Low levels of acculturation and self-efficacy may be risk factors for depression and psychological distress in immigrants. 355 Pakistani immigrant women in Oslo, filled out a questionnaire concerning demographic variables, self-efficacy, and psychological distress. A bidimensional acculturation variable was constructed. A stepwise logistic regression model was used to investigate the importance of the level of acculturation and self-efficacy on psychological distress. Low levels of acculturation were reported. Integrated participants reported significantly less psychological distress on the depression score and total score than separated and marginalized participants. The model showed that assimilated or marginalized participants had a fourth and three times higher risk of high levels of distress compared with integrated participants.

We use pooled cross-sectional survey data from 1988–2002. The results show that on average social integration increases with length of stay. Ethnicity, migration motive and home country education account for differences in integration that develop shortly after arrival and are maintained or even increased with length of stay, while the size of the immigrant group matters mainly at entry and then loses its influence over time. Age at migration exclusively explains differences in social integration that develop with length of stay. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)}

An investigation was conducted into the work-related well-being of Portuguese immigrants in Switzerland. The results show that on a whole Portuguese migrants working in Switzerland are satisfied with their jobs. Longer residential length was associated with higher workplace well-being. Job affective well-being and job satisfaction were predicted by sociocultural adaptation and satisfaction with migration life.}

They expected that the countries with the least pluralistic climate (France and Germany) would show the lowest level of sociocultural adjustment and the highest level of ethnic orientation and language use; the opposite was expected in Australia, as the country with the most pluralistic climate; and the Netherlands would have an intermediate position. The predictions were largely borne out. The language orientation measures yielded a (symbolic) language value factor and a (behavioral) language preference factor. In all countries Turkish identity was a positive predictor and mainstream identity a negative predictor of both the language value and preference factor. Mainstream and Turkish identity showed stronger negative correlations in the less pluralistic countries. It is concluded that immigrants showed the least maintenance and the most adjustment in Australia, which is the country with the least pressure to assimilate. © The Author(s) 2012.}

  Abstract = {This study examines the relation between acculturation and alcohol consumption patterns among older Asian and Hispanic immigrants in the state of California. Data were obtained from the 2009 California Health Interview Survey and included Asian (n = 1264) and Hispanic (n = 571) adults aged 60 and older who were born outside of the US. Outcome variables included presence of past year alcohol consumption, past year binge drinking, and number of binge drinking days. Acculturation was measured with items pertaining to English use and proficiency. Hierarchical multiple or logistic regression analyses were conducted separately for each racial/ethnic group and each dependent variable. Alcohol consumption was found in less than half of the sample for both Asians (43.2\%) and Hispanics (39.2\%). Binge drinking was found in 3.1\% of Asians and 8.4\% of Hispanics. Acculturation was significantly related to past year alcohol consumption for Hispanics, past year binge drinking for Asians, and binge drinking days for Asians, such that higher level of acculturation predicted a greater likelihood of alcohol consumption but decreased likelihood of binge drinking and fewer binge drinking days. The results indicate that acculturation may be related to alcohol consumption patterns for older immigrants. This suggests future needs to develop an in-depth understanding of the health behaviors of these immigrant elderly groups. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

  Abstract = {Based on the theoretical framework of multiple psychological sense of community (MPSOC) and acculturation models, the study explored the relationships between territorial (TPSOC) and ethnic PSOC (EPSOC) and the acculturation behaviors of 2 groups of immigrants who settled in Italy, namely, Albanians (N = 230) and Sri Lankans (N = 131). Based on survey data and quantitative analyses (general linear models), TPSOC and EPSOC were considered first separately and then combined, according to a bidimensional model of MPSOC that resulted in four combinations (dual membership, receiving society membership, ethnic membership, and no membership). The findings highlighted significant variations across groups. Among Albanian participants, both TPSOC and EPSOC were positively associated with integration and negatively with marginalization. Dual membership was positively associated with integration, prevailing ethnic membership with separation, and no membership with marginalization. Among Sri Lankan participants, EPSOC showed a positive association with separation. Dual membership was associated with marginalization, prevailing receiving society membership with assimilation, prevailing ethnic membership with separation, and no membership with integration.}

In the original article, the figure on page 141, the two predictors 'majority group contact' and 'minority group contact' are incorrectly switched. The corrected figure is given in the erratum.] Against the background of contrasting religious versus secular norms in immigrant communities and in Dutch society, this study examines how religious identity expression is related to the social integration of Dutch Muslims within (a) Turkish or Moroccan minority groups and (b) Dutch majority groups. Using nationally representative survey data (N = 2,027), we distinguish religious identification from religious practice (worship and dietary practices) and assertion (support for the role of religion in politics and society) as different forms of religious expression. Structural equation models confirm that minority group contact supports and, conversely, majority group contact suppresses religious practice and assertion. In line with religion as social identity, this result is partly because Dutch Muslims with more minority contacts identify more strongly with their religion, whereas those with more majority contacts identify less strongly. As found in a social capital approach, social integration also directly influences religious expression, especially within the most cohesive Turkish minority group.

  Abstract = {Background: Studies have shown that social integration may have a positive as well as a negative effect on the mental health of immigrants, depending on the social circumstances. Aims of the study: To investigate the relationship between social integration and psychological distress in immigrants in Oslo, Norway, with focus on gender differences. Methods: The study was based on data from a community survey in Oslo (N = 15899), and included 1448 immigrants from non-Western and 1059 immigrants from Western countries. Psychological distress was measured by a 10 items version of Hopkins Symptom Check List (HSCL-10), and social integration was measured by an index based on four items: Knowledge of the Norwegian language, reading Norwegian newspapers, visits by Norwegians and receiving help from Norwegians. Information on paid employment, household income, marital status, social support and conflicts in intimate relationships was also included in the study. Results: The non-western immigrants showed a higher level of psychological distress than the immigrants from western countries. In men this could be explained by the combination of less social integration, less employment, lower income, less social support and more conflicts in intimate relationships among non-western compared to western immigrants. In women the difference in level of psychological stress could not be explained by these variables, even if it was reduced. A reason for this seemed to be that social integration in non-western immigrants had a different effect on mental health in men and women. In men, social integration showed a positive effect through employment and income, as well as a positive effect in other areas. Also in non-western women social integration showed a positive effect through greater access to employment and income, but this effect was levelled out by integration causing problems in other areas. Conclusion: Unexpectedly, social integration in non-western immigrants was associated with good mental health in men, but not in women. A possible explanation for this might be that the traditional female role in these countries is more challenged by social integration into a Western country than the male role, resulting in conflicting norms, threat to the self and/or loss of identity. © 2007 Dalgard and Thapa; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.}

A theoretical framework consisting of acculturation, consumer ethnocentrism, time, and demographics was assembled; and an exploratory study was undertaken involving 255 samples of Malaysian consumers residing in the UK. The findings suggest that levels of consumer ethnocentrism are inversely related to their length of residence in the host country. Hence, respondents who reside longest exhibit less ethnocentric behavior. Contrary to our prediction, no significant relationship exists between assimilation and consumer ethnocentrism. Of significance, however, highly assimilated individuals are likely to be young male and single persons, with low assimilation most likely found in middle-aged to older married females. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}

  Abstract = {The present study produced the Perez Ambiguous Loss of Homeland (PALH) scale to measure Spanish-speaking immigrants’ complex psychological connections with their homeland along two dimensions: immigrants’ sense of ambiguous loss of their homeland and their sense of relative satisfaction with the host country (the United States) compared with their sense of satisfaction with their homeland. In Study 1, surveys were administered to 56 participants to refine the scale. In Study 2, psychometric evaluation of cross-sectional data with 344 participants showed high reliability and validity. Exploratory factor analysis generated a three-factor explanation, which aligned with the hypothesized conceptual framework: ambiguous loss of homeland, satisfaction with the homeland, and satisfaction with the United States. A single scale, relative satisfaction was created by taking the difference between the two satisfaction factors. The PALH can be useful in understanding individuals’ psychological challenges with leaving their homeland and adjusting to life in a new country.}

  Abstract = {This paper investigates the role that acculturation, income, and education play in safety belt nonuse among Californian drivers involved in fatal Motor Vehicle Crashes (MVCs). To achieve this goal, measures of acculturation, income, and education were stochastically incorporated into the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS). Using the 1990 California Tobacco Survey and U.S. Census data, we estimated the combination of zip-code-based measures that most accurately predicts an individual, language-based acculturation index for Hispanics and Asians. Logistic regression was used to investigate the role of these variables in safety belt nonuse in fatal MVCs. We found that acculturation has a positive direct effect on safety belt use among Hispanics. We hypothesize that this positive direct effect is caused by Hispanic immigrants learning the benefits of wearing safety belts. However, our study also suggests an indirect negative effect of acculturation on safety belt use through drinking and driving. Prevention programs aimed at increasing the safety of Hispanic drivers not only need to take acculturation differences into account, but also need to be comprehensive in their message, simultaneously targeting both seat belt nonuse and drinking-and-driving problems. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.}

  Abstract = {Objective: We applied the concept of naïve dialecticism (Peng \& Nisbett,), which characterizes East Asians' greater tendency to encompass contradictory, ever-changing, and interrelated features of an entity, to bicultural contexts and examined its effects on psychological well-being across various acculturating groups. Method: We administered questionnaire measures of the dialectical self, bicultural identity integration (BII; Benet-Martínez \& Haritatos, 2005), and well-being to Hong Kong Chinese (N=213) in Study 1 and Mainland Chinese (N=239) in Study 2. In Study 3, a 4-week longitudinal study was conducted among Hong Kong Chinese (N=173) to test the relationships of these variables over time. We then extended similar measures to new immigrants from Mainland China (N=67) in Study 4 and Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong (N=153) in Study 5. Results: Five studies converged to show that psychological adjustment was positively related to BII, but negatively related to the dialectical self. In Studies 1-3, dialecticism mediated the effect of BII on psychological adjustment among Hong Kong and Mainland Chinese bicultural individuals. Conclusions: Our findings reveal the deleterious effects of tolerance for contradiction on well-being and differentiate biculturalism patterns of immigration-based and globalization-based acculturation. © 2012, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Addressing challenges of theory, methods, and application in acculturation research requires ongoing advancements in methods and theoretical and model development. The current study was designed to explain a person-centered approach to investigating acculturation and biculturalism and to illustrate this method with a sample of 315 Hispanic youth. Pattern analyses of the Hispanicism and Americanism scores from the Bicultural Involvement Scale yielded four distinct acculturation types, including one characterized by moderate scores on both scales. Relations between acculturation types and indicators of individual, family, and peer adaptation were tested. Results indicated that bicultural youth tended to show the most adaptive pattern of functioning across multiple sociocultural domains. Assimilated youth did not show as strongly negative a pattern as has been reported elsewhere. Implications and benefits of a person-centered approach are discussed. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}

Specifically, the study investigated the mediating effects of adjustment in occupational and social life domains on the relationship between acculturation and psychological adjustment for 391 refugees from the former Soviet Union. The study used bilinear measures of acculturation to the host (American) and heritage (Russian) cultures. Using Structural Equation Modeling, the study confirmed the hypothesized relationships, such that the positive effects of American acculturation on psychological adjustment were mediated by occupational adjustment, and the effects of Russian acculturation on psychological adjustment were mediated by satisfaction with co-ethnic social support. Psychological adjustment was measured in two ways, as psychological well-being, using a measure of life satisfaction, and as symptoms of depression and anxiety, using the Hopkins symptom checklist (HSCL). Life satisfaction served as a mediator between adjustment in occupational and social domains and HSCL, suggesting that it may be an intervening variable through which environmental stress associated with immigration contributes to the development of symptoms of mental disorder. © 2013 Society for Community Research and Action.}

Acquiring social support partly mediated the relation between perceived ethnic density and lower distress. Furthermore, the relation between heritage acculturation and distress was double moderated by perceived ethnic density and time lived in the neighborhood. A person–ecology match involvingheritage acculturation and ethnic density was related to better psychological adjustment for participants who The had resided in their neighborhood for less than, but not more than, 2 years.

  Abstract = {Previous research has shown that immigrants' approach orientation positively predicts their attitudes towards contact with host nationals (Matschke \& Sassenberg, 2010). The present research builds on this previous work by investigating the extent to which immigrants' independent vs. interdependent problem-solving style moderates the relation between approach-avoidance orientation and social integration. Interdependent problem-solvers rely on other people to achieve their goals. This interdependence was expected to reduce the influence of approach-avoidance orientation on integration amongst immigrants. Immigrants to Australia (N= 137) completed a questionnaire that included measures of approach-avoidance orientation and problem-solving style. Participants also completed three measures of social integration: (1) proportion of Australian friends, (2) feelings of inclusion in Australian society, and (3) satisfaction with employment, accommodation, and life in Australia. Consistent with previous research, there was a positive relation between approach and social integration and a negative relation between avoidance and social integration. Consistent with predictions, problem-solving style moderated the relation for approach orientation: Only immigrants who were independent problem-solvers showed a significant positive relation between approach and social integration. The results are discussed in relation to Gable's (2006) model of approach and avoidance social goals and motives, and the implications for immigration services are considered. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.}

  Abstract = {In political debates, migrants' political involvement in their countries of origin and successful adaptation to receiving countries are often portrayed as incompatible. We address this concern by examining the links between acculturation preferences, perceived discrimination, and migrants' transnational political involvement in their country of origin. In line with collective action research, a cross-sectional questionnaire study (N= 84) among Senegalese migrants in Paris (France) and Geneva (Switzerland) examined three pathways to transnational political involvement (motivations and actual behaviour). Perceived discrimination, the grievances pathway, was positively related to both transnational motivations (but only when desire to adopt the receiving culture was low) and political behaviour in Senegal. Desire to adopt the culture of the receiving society as an acculturation preference, the embeddedness pathway, was also positively linked to transnational motivations and political behaviour. Finally, desire to maintain the culture of origin as an acculturation preference-the collective identification pathway-was unrelated to transnational political involvement. These findings underscore the compatibility of transnational political involvement in countries of origin and adaptation to receiving societies. We discuss the pivotal role of political psychology in bringing together acculturation psychology and transnationalism studies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.}

  Abstract = {To assess associations between acculturation, depression, and self-reported stress score with reported diagnosis of respiratory disease (RD) in Puerto Rican adults, participants (N = 1,168) were identified from areas of high Hispanic density in the Boston, MA metropolitan area. Eligible participants were interviewed in the home by bilingual interviewers in either Spanish or English. Scales included topics ranging from general background to depressive symptomatology. Respiratory disease was selfreported and checked against prescribed medication. More than one-third (37.8\%) of subjects reported doctor-diagnosed RD. A final binary logistical regression model (N = 850), which was adjusted for potential confounders (sex, age, education, poverty) showed that RD was significantly associated with psychological acculturation (OR = 1.97, P = 0.005), depressive symptomatology (OR = 1.52, P = 0.03) high perceived stress score (OR = 1.97, P = 0.009), and current smoking (OR = 1.61, P = 0.03). Significant inverse associations included a high level of language acculturation (OR = 0.65, P = 0.03), light (OR = 0.67, P = 0.01) and moderate to heavy physical activity versus sedentary physical activity (OR = 0.40, P = 0.03). We found self reported physician diagnosed RD was associated with high perceived stress and depression, as well as higher levels of psychological acculturation. Longitudinal research is needed to determine if there is a causal pathway for these associations. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.}

The ISI-CT incorporates five distinct identity styles (analytical informational, exploratory informational, normative to the country of origin, normative to the host society, and diffuse-avoidant) and a measure of immigrant identity commitment. The article reports the construction of the ISI-CT and examines its factorial structure (Studies 1 and 2), convergent and discriminant validity (Study 1), and longitudinal relationships among subscales (Study 3). Relationships between demographic variables, including age, gender, length of stay, language proficiency, and cultural background, and the ISI-CT subscales are also investigated. Findings support reliability and validity of the ISI-CT as an assessment of the identity processes underlying identity development of people in cultural transition. The potential of this new measurement and construct to contribute to the understanding of the immigrant experience and the wider field of acculturation research is discussed.}

It was possible to identify women who had no major adjustment problems in adapting to life in Canada (n = 70), transitional adjustment problems (n = 30), late onset adjustment problems (n = 7) and chronic adjustment problems (n = 23). These categories were determined by self-report and validated by symptom identification. Style of marriage, communication with spouse and mother-child interactions were hypothesized to be related to adjustment problems. A 16 item questionnaire was developed to assess the degree to which these factors affected adjustment. The only factor which affected degree of adjustment was communication with the spouse. These results are discussed within the context of traditional hypotheses concerning adaptation to a new culture and the implication for treatment.}

  Abstract = {Background: Acculturation is the phenomenon that results when a group with one culture comes into continuous contact with a host culture. Aims: To investigate the correlation between acculturation and psychotic symptomatology in a group of immigrants suffering from psychosis and to explore differences in demographic factors related with the acculturation process between individuals with and without psychosis. Methods: Sixty-five patients and 317 non-psychotic immigrants were interviewed using the Immigrant Acculturation Scale (IAS) and a structured questionnaire for demographic data. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) and the Gl?bal Assessment of Functioning (GAF) were also administered to all immigrants suffering from psychosis. Results: Total IAS scores, as well as IAS everyday life scores, were positively correlated with GAF scores. IAS everyday life score in the patient group related with religion, marital status, gender and years in Greece, while in the non-psychosis group it was related with gender and years in Greece. IAS wishful orientation/nostos (the strong desire for ones homeland) related with religion in both groups. The IAS identity in the psychosis group did not show any significant relation with any of the variables, while in the non-patient group, it was related with marital status, gender and years in Greece. Age, duration of residence in Greece and higher adoption of Greek ethnic identity were the variables that differentiated the two groups of immigrants. Conclusion: Acculturation in immigrants suffering from psychosis could be seen as a process that does not correlate strongly with the severity of the symptomatology but is probably influenced by different set of factors. © 2011 The Author(s).}

  Abstract = {This research examines how the social networks of immigrants residing in a European bicultural and bilingual context (Catalonia) relate to levels of adjustment (both psychological and sociocultural) and to bicultural identity integration (BII). Moroccan, Pakistani, Ecuadorian, and Romanian immigrants residing in Barcelona nominated 25 individuals (i.e., alters) from their habitual social networks and provided demographic (e.g., ethnicity), relationship type (e.g., family, friend, neighbor), and structural (who knew whom) information for each of these alters. Even after controlling for individual-level demographic and acculturation variables, the content and structure of immigrants’ personal social networks had unique associations with both types of adjustment and with BII. Specifically, the overall degree of cultural diversity in the network and the amount of Catalan (but not Spanish) “weak” ties (i.e., acquaintances, colleagues, neighbors) positively predicted these outcomes. Amount of interconnectedness between local coethnic and Catalan/Spanish alters also predicted sociocultural adjustment and BII positively. Finally, against a “culture and language similarity” hypothesis, Moroccan and Pakistani participants had social networks that were more culturally integrated, relative to Ecuadorians and Romanians. Results from this study attest to the importance of examining actual intercultural relations and going beyond individuals’ reported acculturation preferences to understand immigrants’ overall adaptation and cultural identity dynamics. Furthermore, results highlight the interplay between interculturalism experienced at the intrapersonal, subjective level (i.e., BII), and at the meso-level (i.e., having culturally diverse networks that also include interethnic ties among alters).}

  Abstract = {In this study, the military served as a specific arena for the contextual examination of the relationship between immigrants' cultural identity and adjustment. Our investigation was grounded in the recent literature suggesting that cultural identity, adaptation, and the relationship between them are affected by contextual factors. We see the military in general, and the Israeli army in particular, as a highly assimilative context. We therefore predicted that national identity would significantly promote immigrant's adaptation. Three hundred and sixty-five young soldiers who had recently immigrated from the former Soviet Union and serving their compulsory military service in the Israeli Defense Forces, completed anonymous questionnaires. Our findings revealed that national identity was indeed positively related to adjustment, especially adjustment to the military setting. In contrast, ethnic identity was not correlated with adjustment. When classified into acculturation categories, according to Berry's bi-dimensional model, individuals in both the "marginalization" and the "separation" groups exhibited low levels of adaptation. Common to these two strategies is the rejection of host culture. Three factors - language abilities, sources of cohesion and goals in service - were examined as possible mediators for the effects of national identity on the immigrants' adjustment to military service. National identity was shown to affect adaptation partially through sources of cohesion and goals in service. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract = {The process of cross-cultural migration may be particularly difficult for students travelling overseas for further or higher education, especially where qualitative differences exist between the home and host nations. The present study examined the sociocultural adjustment of sojourning Malaysian students in Britain. Eighty-one Malay and 110 Chinese students enrolled in various courses answered a self-report questionnaire that examined various aspects of sociocultural adjustment. A series of one-way analyses of variance showed that Malay participants experienced poorer sociocultural adjustment in comparison with their Chinese counterparts. They were also less likely than Chinese students to have contact with co-nationals and host nationals, more likely to perceive their actual experience in Britain as worse than they had expected, and more likely to perceive greater cultural distance and greater discrimination. The results of regression analyses showed that, for Malay participants, perceived discrimination accounted for the greatest proportion of variance in sociocultural adjustment (73\%), followed by English language proficiency (10\%) and contact with host nationals (4\%). For Chinese participants, English language proficiency was the strongest predictor of sociocultural adjustment (54\%), followed by expectations of life in Britain (18\%) and contact with host nationals (3\%). By contrast, participants' sex, age, and length of residence failed to emerge as significant predictors for either ethnic group. Possible explanations for this pattern of findings are discussed, including the effects of Islamophobia on Malay-Muslims in Britain, possible socioeconomic differences between Malay and Chinese students, and personality differences between the two ethnic groups. The results are further discussed in relation to practical steps that can be taken to improve the sociocultural adjustment of sojourning students in Britain. © 2008 International Union of Psychological Science.}

The convergence and divergence of viewpoints will illuminate the perceptual gaps between native and immigrant communities. In addition, the composite score of the markers will provide a measurement of social inclusiveness; it reflects the depth of psychological barriers imposed by the individual in preserving the distinct boundaries of citizenship. Multivariate analyzes showed that the two groups reacted differently to the challenges and benefits from immigration. Surprisingly, naturalized citizens were more sensitive to the impact of perceived immigrant threats and contribution even though they imposed fewer barriers to the new arrivals in becoming a part of the mainstream society.

Depression among Korean immigrants was hypothesized to be associated with socio-demo-graphic and cultural factors, including health status, gender, education, financial status, acculturation level, familism, social support, especially from the family, and family relationships. A face-to-face interview was conducted in Korean using a structured questionnaire. Depression in this study was measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies of Depression (CES-D) Scale. A substantial percentage of the sample was experiencing a high level of depression. The mean score on the CES-D scale was 15.1, slightly below 16, a cut-off score for clinical depression, and almost 40\% of the respondents scored 16 or above on the scale, indicating a high rate of clinical depression for the study sample. In multiple regression analyses, perceived health status and education were significant predictors among socio-demographic factors. Among cultural factors, acculturation status was not a significant predictor; however, positive support from the family and family relationships were significantly associated with depression. The role of family as a risk factor for depression in older Korean immigrants and implications for mental health policy, programs, and future research are discussed. © 2004 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

  Abstract = {Whether immigrants to the U.S. from collectivist cultures will adopt American individualist values is an important question at the intersection of theories on acculturation and individualism/collectivism. According to the assimilation hypothesis, Turkish immigrants to the U.S. should become more individualistic with increasing length of stay. Alternatively, the immigrant interdependence hypothesis proposes that the exigencies of immigration require retaining or increasing collectivist values and behaviors, especially the willingness to rely on others. Measures of individualism and collectivism were obtained from Turkish immigrants to the U.S., Turks residing in Istanbul, and residents of Boston. Bostonians and Istanbul residents differed primarily on vertical collectivism, which is the tendency to subordinate ones own goals to those of in-group authority figures. Immigrants' values did not change with increasing length of stay in the U.S., refuting the assimilation hypothesis. When immigrants were compared to non-immigrants, immigrants endorsed stronger horizontal and vertical collectivism and more desire to both give and receive, consistent with the immigrant interdependence hypothesis. However, this hypothesis was not uniformly supported. Compared to non-immigrants, immigrants reported more self-reliance with competition, and more internal locus of control, indicating a sense of agency and responsibility. Findings are consistent with the view that immigrants adjust in complex ways to their new society, and may have different temperaments than non-immigrants. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.}

The current study investigates the association between acculturation and suicidal ideation among Turkish migrants in the Netherlands. The mediating effect of hopelessness and moderating effect of secure attachment are also examined. A total of 185 Turkish migrants living in the Netherlands were recruited through social media and through liaison with community groups. They completed an online survey including validated measures of suicidal ideation, hopelessness, acculturation and attachment style. Mediation and moderation analyses were tested using bootstrapping. Higher participation was associated with less hopelessness and less suicidal ideation. Greater maintenance of one's ethnic culture was associated with higher hopelessness and higher suicidal ideation. Greater participation was associated with less suicidal ideation particularly amongst those with less secure attachment styles. Turkish migrants who participate in the host culture may have a lower risk of developing suicidal thinking. Participation may protect against suicidal thinking, particularly among those with less secure attachment styles.},

Method: We used Smith's (2003) theory of religious effects and Baron and Kenny's (1986) approach for mediation analysis to explain the mediating role of social support between DSE and depression. The sample consisted of 200 elderly Korean immigrants who were aged 65 or older (mean age = 72.5, range = 65-89) living in the New York City Metropolitan area. Hierarchical regression model was used with SPSS version 17.0 to analyze cross-sectional data. Results: Elderly Korean immigrants in the present sample were found to be moderately engaged in DSE but not experiencing a fair level of social support. Respondents reported no depression on the average but 30\% of them (60 out of 200 respondents) were experiencing mild to severe depression. Both DSE and social support were inversely related with depression, and the relationship between DSE and depression was mediated by social support. Conclusion: These findings are only suggestive and should not be generalized to a larger population. However, this study supports the importance of DSE and social support in the life of elderly Korean immigrants as a way to alleviate depression. Mental health professionals may consider facilitating social network when elderly Korean immigrants suffer from depression. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.}

  Abstract = {An opportunity sample of 108 Chinese participants (n male = 51 and n female = 57; M age = 29.34) was compared to a second opportunity sample of 98 Northern Irish participants (n male = 45 and n female = 53; M age = 23.67) on levels of acculturation, self-efficacy and social support. The administered questionnaire contained three scales to measure the aforementioned constructs. The first was the AMAS-NIC, a version of the Abbreviated Multidimensional Acculturation Scale [Zea, M. C., Asner-Self, K. K., Birman, D., \& Buki, L. P. (2003). The Abbreviated Multidimensional Acculturation Scale: Empirical validation with two Latino/Latina samples. Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology, 9, 107-126] modified to apply to a population of Chinese immigrants in Northern Ireland. The second measure was Mary Wegner's 1992 English version of the General Self-Efficacy Scale [Wright, S., Johnston, M., \& Weinman, J. (1995). Measures in health psychology portfolio. UK: Windsor]. The third was the Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ) whose items emerged through a semi-structured interview and was designed to measure levels of received and sought social support. The purpose of the study was to ascertain the extent to which previous findings concerning acculturation can be generalised to a Chinese immigrant population in Northern Ireland, a country characterised by segregation. T-tests, correlation analyses and a hierarchical regression initially provided support for the generalisability of previous studies on the health benefits of integration as a preferred acculturation strategy [Berry, J. W. (2008). Globalisation and acculturation. International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 32, 328-336], but further interpretation of the results brought to light the shortcomings of this model in the context of a segregated society and the inapplicability of the GSES measure within a collectivistic immigrant population. The limitations of the study are discussed and recommendations for future research are made. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

  Abstract = {Objectives: The aim of this study is to examine the relative contribution of acculturation, perceived social support, and perceived discrimination on psychological well-being (PWB) among Middle Eastern (ME) migrants in Australia. Method(s): A cross-sectional study was conducted in Queensland, Australia. A total of 382 first-generation young adult (aged 20–39 years) ME migrants completed a self-administered questionnaire. The hypothesised model was tested through a two-step process: measurement, and structural model testing. First, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was applied to test the fit of the measurement model and reliability and validity indices were calculated. Structural Equations Modelling (SEM) was then used to test the structural model. The significance of the mediating effect was tested using bootstrapping method. Results: Mainstream acculturation had the greatest accumulated total effect on PWB through both a direct and an indirect effect via perceived discrimination. Ethnic acculturation had the second greatest total effect on PWB, with both a direct effect and indirect effects through perceived social support and perceived discrimination. Perceived discrimination demonstrated both a direct effect and an indirect effect on PWB through perceived social support. Perceived social support had only a direct effect on PWB. Conclusions: Facilitating ME migrants’ active participation in both ethnic and mainstream societies is important. Moreover, developing ethnic communities associations and resources could be an effective option to provide social support to ME migrants and in turn to improve their PWB. To provide ME migrants with better mental health outcomes, there is still a need to minimize the discrimination against them.}

Relative Acculturation Extended Model: New contributions with regard to the study of acculturation. International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 29, 21-37], is used for this. This model differentiates between the real and ideal planes of acculturation, that is, between the strategies that are actually put into practice and attitudes that are preferred. Moreover, the model distinguishes seven spheres, or domains, of acculturation (political, work, economic, social, family, religious and ways of thinking), in which persons (immigrants and natives) adopt and prefer different acculturation options (strategies and attitudes). About 1523 persons (397 Maghrebis, 434 Sub-Saharans, 398 Spaniards who evaluated the Maghreb exogroup and 385 Spaniards who evaluated the Sub-Saharan exogroup), answered a questionnaire made expressly for the study. According to our predictions, immigrants and natives coincide in their choices for acculturation ("assimilation") in the peripheral domains of the RAEM (work, economic); they also coincide in their acculturation attitudes in the social domain ("integration"); however, they differ enormously in the options preferred for the central spheres, or hard core, of the culture (e.g., family, religious, ways of thinking): While immigrants prefer "separation", natives continue to prefer "assimilation". Advantages of the RAEM division into domains of acculturation are discussed with regard to previous models, as well as the implications for predicting inter-group conflict. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract = {This study documents the indirect effects of social and environmental variables as mediated by immigrant stress and physical health. Using data from a large dual frame sample of first generation mandarin speaking Chinese immigrants in metropolitan Los Angeles counties with the largest groups of Chinese immigrants, this study uses a path analytic approach to trace how predictors are related to depressive symptoms and to measure direct and indirect influences of variables. Although bivariate analyses suggested that many predictors were associated with depressive symptoms, multivariate path analysis revealed a more complex structure of mediated associations. In the multivariate path analysis only reports of physical health and immigrant stress were directly related to depressive symptoms (P {\textless} 0.05), while acculturation, time in the US, income, US citizenship, and distance of persons on whom one could rely were related to stress (but not to physical health status) and only to depressive symptoms as mediated by stress. Age and educational attainment were related to health status (and to stress as mediated by physical health) and to depressive symptoms as mediated by both health and stress. These variables were also unrelated directly to health status and to depressive symptoms. Associations were evaluated using statistical significance, P {\textless} 0.05. This study demonstrates the significance of stress and health as mediators of variables in the larger context of the physical environment and suggests that the mechanisms linking ecological characteristics of immigrants to depressive symptoms may be stress and physical health among immigrants.}

The results from the two studies showed that the SWMLS has favorable psychometric characteristics. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of the SWMLS resulted in a unidimensional factor structure. Cronbach's α was excellent. Evidence of validity was also found between scores on the SWMLS and other indicators of well-being and acculturation. The findings suggested a brief and viable tool to assess satisfaction with migration life. Potential uses of the scale for research are discussed.}

  Abstract = {Social workers are increasingly challenged to provide culturally sensitive services to older immigrants from diverse backgrounds. Assessment tools developed in the elder's own cultural context can maximize appropriate assessment and planning. This article describes the development of a tool for measuring adherence to tradition in Chinese elders. In Chinese tradition, an elder's purpose, meaning, and self-worth are derived, in large part, from their contribution to family, relatives, and the community. Existing measures of filial piety and acculturation do not capture this dimension. Filial piety involves being on the receiving end of care, honor, and obedience from younger generations. Acculturation is the opposite of adherence to tradition. One thousand five-hundred and two Chinese elders in China were asked questions on mutual aid and intergenerational exchange. Factor analysis extracted nine items loading into two factors reflective of traditional exchange. This measure could prove useful in understanding the effect of traditional beliefs upon various psychosocial outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

  Abstract = {Past research has documented the role acculturation plays in the process of adjustment to new cultures among migrants. Yet little attention has been paid thus far to the role of acculturation in the context of forced migration. In this study we examined the association between acculturation patterns and mental health symptoms among a convenience sample of Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers (n = 118) who accessed health services at the Physicians for Human Rights Open-Clinic in Israel. Participants completed measures on sociodemographic information as well as detention history, mental health symptoms, exposure to traumatic events, and acculturation pattern, in their native language upon accessing services. Consistent with our predictions, findings showed that acculturation predicted depressive symptoms among asylum seekers beyond the effect of history of detention and reports of experiences of traumatic events. Assimilated compared with integrated asylum seekers reported higher depressive symptoms. Findings draw attention to the paradox of assimilation, and the mental health risks it poses among those wishing to integrate into the new culture at the expanse of their original culture. Asylum seekers may be particularly vulnerable to the risks of assimilation in the restrictive policies that characterize many industrial countries in recent years.}

The predictive power of two different operationalisations of fit was compared. School students (193 German host society members and 128 immigrants to Germany) participated in a questionnaire study. Findings revealed that both acculturation strategies of one group and relative 'fit' between immigrant and host society strategy preference were predictive of intergroup relations. In general, a strategy of integration was associated with more favourable intergroup relations in both groups, and a mismatch between host and immigrant preferred strategies yielded the most negative outcomes.

  Abstract = {The successful integration of immigrants into a host country's society, economy, and polity has become a major issue for policymakers in recent decades. Scientific progress in the study of immigrant integration has been hampered by the lack of a common measure of integration, which would allow for the accumulation of knowledge through comparison across studies, countries, and time. To address this fundamental problem, we propose the Immigration Policy Lab (IPL) Integration Index as a pragmatic and multidimensional measure of immigrant integration. The measure, both in the 12-item short form (IPL-12) and the 24-item long form (IPL-24), captures six dimensions of integration: psychological, economic, political, social, linguistic, and navigational. The measure can be used across countries, over time, and across different immigrant groups and can be administered through short questionnaires available in different modes. We report on four surveys we conducted to evaluate the empirical performance of our measure. The tests reveal that the measure distinguishes among immigrant groups with different expected levels of integration and also correlates with well-established predictors of integration.},

  Abstract = {Background: The association between acculturation and physical activity (PA) among Mexican American (MA) adults is not understood. This study assessed potential mediating factors that may explain these associations among 75 healthy MA adults [age: 37.5 (9.3) y; 65.3\% female]. Methods: Secondary data analysis using hierarchical logistic regression examined whether perceived environmental barriers, social support, and intention to exercise potentially mediated relationships between acculturation level, and total and leisure-Time moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA). Data were collected via questionnaire. Results: Most participants (67\%) reported lower average household monthly incomes (\$0-\$3000), completed some college or obtained a college degree (64.4\%), and were first generation immigrants (59\%). Acculturation was associated with greater odds of engaging in total MVPA [odds ratio (OR) = 1.7; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-2.4] and leisure-Time MVPA (OR = 1.6; 95\% CI, 1.1-1.2). Perceived environmental barriers were associated with greater odds of engaging in both total and leisure-Time MVPA (OR = 4.3; 95\% CI, 2.1-5.8 and OR = 5.5; 95\% CI, 2.0-7.0, respectively), and social support was associated with greater odds for total MVPA (OR = 3.7; 95\% CI, 1.1-6.4). Conclusions: Results provide preliminary evidence for mediating factors that may explain the relationship between acculturation level and PA among MAadults. Contradicting prior evidence, results suggest that PA engagement, despite perceived environmental barriers, is possible among MA adults having stronger social support.}

Specifically, we explored the impact of race-based rejection sensitivity on well-being, and whether cultural identity clarity could help curtail any negative effects. Hypothesis 1 was that race-based rejection sensitivity would be negatively associated with well-being. Hypothesis 2 was that cultural identity clarity would moderate the association between race-based rejection sensitivity and well-being such that Latino/a immigrants lower in cultural identity clarity would experience poorer well-being than those higher in cultural identity clarity. Method: A community sample of Latino/a immigrants (N = 136; Mage = 38.21; 51.47\% female) completed a survey including measures of race-based rejection sensitivity, cultural identity clarity, bicultural stress, selfesteem, and life satisfaction. Results: Correlation and regression analyses revealed that race-based rejection sensitivity was negatively associated with well-being. Additionally, high cultural identity clarity attenuated the negative association between race-based rejection sensitivity and well-being. Conclusion: Results of the present study suggest maintaining clarity over their heritage cultures postimmigration can be beneficial to Latino/a immigrants in Canada, in particular when they are sensitive to cues of racial discrimination.}

The sample was comprised of 83 first-generation ICMs of preschool children residing in Maryland, Unites States (US). Cluster analysis revealed four acculturation styles: psychologically-behaviorally integrated; psychologically-behaviorally assimilated; psychologically-behaviorally undifferentiated; and psychologically-behaviorally separated. Assimilated mothers were the youngest at immigration and had resided in the US for the longest time. Separated mothers were older at immigration, resided in the US for a shorter time, were less educated, and had lower psychological functioning than mothers in the other clusters. However, there were no differences in demographic characteristics and psychological functioning between psychologically-behaviorally integrated and psychologically-behaviorally undifferentiated clusters. The importance of simultaneously assessing various cultural orientations and components of acculturation was highlighted. © 2012 The Author(s).}

We studied samples of international students from three Canadian Universities at the beginning of an academic year (N = 228) and at the end of the same year (N = 72). The results supported the hypotheses that autonomous motivation to study abroad is a predictor of students' various adjustment outcomes at different times of the academic year and that the preservation goals have a weaker negative effect upon the adjustment outcomes and this effect is relatively independent from the effect of autonomy. These results are consistent with the previous study of Chinese international students in Belgium and Canada [Chirkov, V.I., Vansteenkiste, M., Tao, R., \& Lynch, M. (2006).

The role that gender, marital status and country of origin play in moderating these relations is also studied and discussed. The main conclusion further justifies the importance of motivation in understanding the adjustment dynamics of various groups of migrants. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

  Abstract = {The present study tests the hypothesis that involvement with a new culture instigates changes in personality of immigrants that result in (a) better fit with the norms of the culture of destination and (b) reduced fit with the norms of the culture of origin. Participants were 40 Japanese first-generation immigrants to the United States, 57 Japanese monoculturals, and 60 U.S. monoculturals. All participants completed the Jackson Personality Inventory as a measure of the Big Five; immigrants completed the Japanese American Acculturation Scale. Immigrants' fits with the cultures of destination and origin were calculated by correlating Japanese American mothers' patterns of ratings on the Big Five with the average patterns of ratings of European Americans and Japanese on the same personality dimensions. Japanese Americans became more "American" and less "Japanese" in their personality as they reported higher participation in the U.S. culture. The results support the view that personality can be subject to cultural influence. © The Author(s) 2012.}

  Abstract = {Background: It has often been shown that immigrants are particularly at risk for mental ill health. The aim of the study was to investigate the association of immigrant- and non-immigrant-specific factors with mental ill health within a diverse immigrant population. Method: An extensive questionnaire was sent out to a stratified random sample of three immigrant populations from Finland, Iraq and Iran. The 720 respondents completed a Swedish, Arabic or Farsi (Persian) version of the questionnaire including the WHO (10) Well-Being Index and the HSCL-25. Results: The results indicate that mental ill health among immigrants is independently associated with non-immigrant-specific factors (i.e. high number of types of traumatic episodes, divorced/widowed, poor social network, economic insecurity and being female) and immigrant-specific factors (i.e. low level of sociocultural adaptation). These results were obtained regardless of whether mental ill health was operationalized as low subjective well-being or a high symptom level of anxiety/depression. Conclusions: These fi ndings support the notion that mental ill health among immigrants is a multi-faceted phenomenon that needs to be tackled within a wide range of sectors - e.g. the healthcare system, the social service sector and, of course, the political arena.}

Using a more nuanced conceptualization of acculturation than previous studies, we explore the associations between acculturation and Hispanic children's asthma. Data came from an observational mail survey of caretakers of Hispanic schoolchildren in El Paso, Texas (N = 1,513). Results from generalized linear models (GzLMs) demonstrate that acculturation was a significant positive predictor of asthma. The addition of interaction terms revealed that prenatal smoking, low birth weight, breastfeeding, and pest exposure significantly modified the effect of acculturation on asthma. Results suggest that although higher levels of acculturation were detrimental overall, the effects were not equally damaging for all Hispanic children. Findings foster an understanding of how the effect of acculturation on Hispanic children's asthma is intensified or attenuated by distinct individual-level risk factors.}

  Abstract = {The situation of refugees in Germany and other countries is a current and important matter. The present study adopts an ecological approach to investigate how refugees perceive the welcoming climate in Germany and the consequences of this perception. To further explore the refugees’ situation, we examined several predictors of their psychological adjustment and acculturation attitudes. In a field study in Eastern Germany with N= 94 refugees as participants, we assessed the perceived context of reception, and perceived acculturation attitudes as contextual variables, discrimination and contact as intergroup variables and, on the individual level, psychological adjustment as well as the personal acculturation attitudes as dependent variables. The results revealed that more perceived discrimination resulted in an increase in reported psychological problems. Refugees living in asylum centers reported more psychological problems and more perceived discrimination than those living in independent housing. The perceived context of reception positively predicted refugees’ desire for maintenance of intergroup relations with the host society. Positive intergroup contact lowered their desire for cultural maintenance. In sum, this study gives us rare and valuable insight into refugees’ perspectives in the context of recent immigration to Germany. In doing so, it emphasizes the importance of a welcoming climate. The study shows how meaningful the assessment of the perceived context of reception is. Practical implications for fields such as the accommodation of refugees are discussed.}

Methods: A total of n = 90 patients with different ethnic backgrounds from an outpatient consultation service for immigrants at the Hannover Medical School were investigated by the Hannover Migration and Mental Health Interview (HMMH), the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Frankfurt Acculturation Scale (FRAKK). Results: The majority of the subjects (84.4\%) had a clinically significant depression. The extent of depressive symptoms was determined by the selected acculturation style (1) (F = 3.29, p = .025): Subjects with integration as acculturation style showed less depressive symptoms than subjects with assimilation as acculturation style. Furthermore, subjects with segregation as acculturation style also showed less depressive symptoms than subjects with assimilation. Conclusion: The results suggest that even when undergoing extreme emotional distress, eventually leading to mental disorder, integration, as an acculturation style, seems to serve as a protective resource and possibly prevents further decline.}

If such reference group is fashioned by close social relations with coethnics, the higher the immigrants' need for closure, the weaker their tendency to assimilate to the new culture and the stronger their tendency to adhere to the culture of origin. By contrast, if the reference entry group is fashioned by close relations with members of the host country, the higher their need for closure, the stronger their tendency to adapt to the new culture and the weaker their tendency to maintain the culture of origin. These findings obtained consistently across 3 immigrant samples in Italy, 1 Croatian and 2 Polish, and across multiple different measures of acculturation.}

Negative Perfectionism significantly predicted more eating disorder symptoms as measured by the EDI. A strong positive evaluation of other ethnic groups together with high Positive Perfectionism predicted lower body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness, whereas the opposite was true for a more negative evaluation of other groups and high Positive Perfectionism. A strong sense of belonging and attachment towards the Chinese culture and valuing other ethnic groups were found to mediate the relationship between Positive Perfectionism and eating disorder symptoms, predicting a lower sense of interpersonal distrust. Immigrant Chinese showed better adaptation with strong ethnic attachment as well as valuing the mainstream culture. Results also suggest that promoting Positive Perfectionism together with strong ethnic identification and values towards the mainstream culture may be advantageous to Chinese immigrants.}

  Abstract = {Using a sample of Korean American elders, this study examined internal mechanisms by which the level of acculturation influences mental health outcomes. We hypothesized that the impact of five domains of acculturation on mental distress (depressive symptoms and anxiety) would be mediated by individuals' subjectively appraised acculturative stress. The latter was indexed by measures of task-oriented and emotion-oriented stress. The results from structural equation modeling with 472 Korean American elders in Florida (M age=69.9, SD=7.04) provided support for the mediation model. Findings demonstrate that acculturation exerts an influence on mental health and that acculturative stress functions as a mediator in the linkage between the level of acculturation and mental distress. Findings suggest avenues for facilitating immigrant elders' positive adaptation and promoting their mental well-being. © The Author 2009.

It was hypothesised that the level of shame/izzat associated with mental health would predict intention to access services when controlling for other, more established, predictors. Ninety-four participants were recruited from community UK centres and online sources. Results indicated that shame/izzat and biological beliefs predicted lesser intent to access psychological services, whereas higher levels of acculturation and education predicted greater intention. Further analyses suggested differences between people that had migrated to Britain and those born in the United Kingdom. Higher education levels predicted greater intention for all participants. However, shame/izzat and duration of habitation in Britain were significant predictors for migrant participants, whereas acculturation predicted intent for those that were born in the country. Clinical implications and suggestions for future research are discussed. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.}

  Abstract = {This study assessed the efficacy of a model predicting the host country identification of members of immigrant groups. The model proposed that host country identification is primarily determined by the positivity of the immigrants' acculturation attitude towards living according to the standards and values of the host country, followed by the degree of acceptance by members of the dominant cultural group, the success immigrants experience in the new country, and the extent to which they choose to live within their ethnic environment rather than the wider society. The study included 602 adult immigrants from a number of countries (Vietnam, People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, and New Zealand), which varied in their cultural similarity to the host country, Australia. Results from a multiple regression analysis of participants' questionnaire responses revealed good support for the model. As expected, acculturation attitude towards Australia was the strongest predictor of host country identification, followed by acceptance by Australians, while extent of ethnic involvement was a significant negative predictor. The results also revealed ethnic identification as a significant positive predictor of host country identification. The importance of the relationship between acculturation attitudes and identification is discussed, together with immigrants' identification processes towards their ethnic group and the host country.

One hundred and thirty-one female immigrants were recruited from community service centers. Hierarchical regression results showed that general stress and acculturative stress were linked to distress. Social support did not play a buffering role on distress. Whereas length of resi- dence and social support were strongly related to informal help-seeking, acculturation, along with age and social support, were related to profes- sional help-seeking. Given the differential effects of various cultural change variables, the importance of independently assessing their influence on immigrant mental health and help-seeking is warranted.}

In addition, it also examined the relationship between demographic factors and adjustment and compared the predictive value of attachment styles and demographic factors for immigrants' adjustment. The Attachment Style Questionnaire was used to assess respondents' attachment. Psychological adjustment was measured with the Psychological Health Scale and the Satisfaction With Life Scale. Sociocultural adjustment was measured with the Social Support List - Interactions scale. Two scales for measuring identification and contact with the native and with the Dutch culture were developed and used as indicators of cultural adjustment. We found relations between attachment styles and psychological and sociocultural adjustment. Secure attachment was positively related (p.01) to psychological and sociocultural adjustment, fearful attachment was negatively (p.01) associated with psychological adjustment, and more negatively with identification with the Dutch culture than with identification with the native culture. Preoccupied attachment was negatively related (p.01) to psychological adjustment and to identification with the Dutch culture. Dismissing attachment was weakly negatively related (p.01) to sociocultural adjustment. Correlation patterns across the three immigrants' samples indicate that dismissing individuals remain relatively indifferent towards their native and the Dutch culture. Regarding demographic factors we found that education and age at immigration were positively associated with psychological and sociocultural adjustment, and length of residence appeared to be positively related to sociocultural adjustment. In general, demographic factors showed a stronger association with sociocultural than with psychological adjustment. Regression analysis revealed that attachment styles were better predictors of immigrants' psychological and sociocultural adjustment than demographic factorseducation, age at immigration, and length of residence. The results indicate that immigrant studies would benefit from taking an attachment perspective. © 2008 International Union of Psychological Science.},

Personal views about aging, measured with a subscale of the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale (PGCMS), were regressed on demographic variables, physical health-related factors, and psychosocial attributes (social network and acculturation). Results from the hierarchical regression analysis showed that better physical health conditions (fewer chronic conditions, less functional disability, and better vision) were associated with more positive personal views about aging. Other significant contributors included larger social networks and higher levels of acculturation. Findings suggest that personal views about aging among immigrant elderly populations can be enhanced by promoting physical health, social connectedness, and acculturation. Ways to maintain and improve positive attitudes about personal aging are discussed in a cultural context. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.}

  Abstract = {The adjustment of 2 groups of immigrant students in an Israeli university was investigated as a function of their acculturation attitudes and the perceived attitude of the host society. Acculturation attitudes were divided into group attitudes representing generalized aims of the group, and personal attitudes pertaining to individual aims of acculturation that deviate from these group aims. We argued that a preference for acculturation attitudes that contradicted the group consensus would be detrimental to immigrants' psychological adjustment, whereas normative attitudes would not adversely affect this adjustment. It was hypothesized further that personal and group attitudes would not have different effects on social adjustment and that both facets of adjustment would be affected by the attitude of the majority. The data generally supported the research hypotheses. Copyright © 2005 by V. H. Winston \& Son, Inc. All rights reserved.}

  Abstract = {Posted August 6, 2003. Using a combined student and community sample, the present study examined whether there were cultural differences in gender role stereotypes between Anglo-Australians and Chinese background immigrants and sojourners in Australia. In addition, cultural differences in the sex-based differentiation of gender roles were examined, along with an assessment of the possible mediating role of acculturation. Five-hundred and ninety participants (418 Anglo-Australians, 172 of Chinese background) from academic institutions and community groups in Melbourne, Australia were administered the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI), an individual-level measure of gender roles. Factor analyses of the Bem items showed similar factor structures for the two cultural groups, despite differences on their country-level indices of masculinity (Hofstede, 1998). Further, Hofstede's proposal that sex differences in gender roles would be more pronounced in 'masculine' societies was not supported, however both genders identified more strongly with masculine values/traits if they were Anglo-Australian in background, and with feminine values/traits if they were of Chinese origin. The possible role of acculturation in mediating these identifications was not established.}

This study examined body mass index (BMI), body image, and various facets of emotional distress as contributors to weight-related eating among less-acculturated female Latina college students. It was hypothesized that unique combinations of BMI, body image, depression, anxiety, and stress would predict routine restraint, compensatory restraint, susceptibility to external cues, and emotional eating in less-acculturated Latina college students. Participants were 141 college students from a rural region in southeastern California who completed questionnaires. Preoccupation with being overweight, a body-image variable, significantly predicted routine and compensatory restraint whereas stress was an important correlate of reasons for eating other than hunger. Implications of the findings include the potential to inform models of weight-related eating among less-acculturated Latina college students. Limitations include homogeneity of sample pertinent to Latino descent. Future directions are discussed.}

This study investigated the relationship between a range of independent variables such as, demographic factors, acculturation, acculturative stress, and resilience and the dependent variable that is the employment status of former refugees. Method: Questionnaire data were gathered from 169 participants from the Ethiopian, Congolese, and Myanmar communities settled in Brisbane, Australia. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to investigate the factors that predicted employment status. Results: Resilience and demographic variables such as age, education, gender, and country of origin were not associated with being employed. Length of stay and English proficiency increased the likelihood of being employed. Surprisingly, an increase in acculturation was associated with the likelihood of being unemployed, while an increase in acculturative stress was associated with the likelihood of being employed. Conclusions: These findings indicate that unemployed participants perceived themselves to be acculturated and integrated, while those who were employed reported more acculturative stress. Furthermore, employment despite its positive impact can also be stressful. The study has practical and theoretical implications for stakeholders involved in the employment of refugees.}

  Abstract = {Asian international students' acculturation to Australia was significantly influenced by their personal ties with other international (non-conational), conational, and local Australian students, and by the individual difference of need for cognitive closure (NCC). High NCC students tended to find their sojourn in the foreign country more unsettling and stressful. Nevertheless, having personal ties with locals alleviated their psychological adjustment. Students with more international ties were better adjusted in general. The study also suggested that international students' social identities may change dynamically during their acculturation. Greater social ties of all three types facilitated identification with their Australian university. Further, cognitively open and flexible low NCC students tended to hold stronger identification with their heritage culture if having more international ties. Further research should replicate these results with potential applied implications for those concerned with international education. The present results were also compared with the previous research on international immigrants. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

  Abstract = {Background: Although psychological distress among Asian immigrants adjusting to a Western society has been reported in the clinical literature, empirical research support for this phenomenon is lacking. This is particularly true regarding Korean immigrants, an Asian population that is currently immigrating to non-Asian countries in large numbers. Aims: This study investigated how degree of acculturation and adherence to Asian values correlate with psychological distress among Korean immigrants (N = 118) in the United States. Method: Participants from the Midwestern United States (N = 118) completed survey packets including a demographic questionnaire, the Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identity Acculturation Scale, the Asian Values Scale, and the Brief Symptom Inventory 18. Results: A multiple regression analysis revealed that less acculturation, stronger adherence to Asian values, and fewer years of living or being educated in the host country cumulatively predicted heightened psychological distress in this population. However, no single variable alone significantly predicted psychological distress, indicating that additional factors not studied here may influence distress symptoms among Korean immigrants. Conclusion: Psychological distress among Korean immigrants living in a Western culture can be identified, and it is associated with a combination of lifestyle factors that impact mental health. © Shadowfax Publishing and Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.}

  Abstract = {This work focuses on the study of the psychological acculturation process of the largest immigrant group in Spain: Romanian immigrants. It is known that both social support and perceived discrimination affect the acculturation process of immigrant people, but not how those three variables act together. This study aims to analyse the mechanism by which social support affects the acculturation of immigrant people –both maintenance and adoption dimensions in public and private acculturation domains– and the role played by perceived discrimination –both group and individual– in that relationship. In order to fulfil this goal, 150 immigrant people of Romanian origin (49.3\% male) with a mean age of 35.33 years (SD = 11.84) answered a questionnaire, which included the aforementioned variables. Results show that social support has a positive indirect effect on the degree of adoption of Spanish customs (both in public and private domains) by Romanian immigrants through a reduction of their perceived discrimination. Besides, social support has no effect on Romanian immigrants’ maintenance of home society customs. This research contributes to knowledge on how immigrants’ perceived social support is related to their adoption of host society’s customs, highlighting the mediating role of the perceived discrimination in this process.}

One aspect of differentiation, the ability to take an "I-position" with others, uniquely predicted greater American acculturation and less Russian acculturation, indicating that participants who reported an ability to act on their own needs in the context of social pressure tended to be more assimilated. Russian acculturation was also uniquely associated with more frequent perceived discrimination (one aspect of acculturative stress) during adolescence.

With regard to the role of social problem solving, among the five dimensions of social problem solving (i.e., positive problem orientation, negative problem orientation, rational problem solving, impulsive/careless style, and avoidant style), negative problem orientation and impulsive/careless style significantly predicted depressive symptoms. Avoidant style significantly interacted with acculturative stress, indicating that avoidant style is associated with depressive symptoms when acculturative stress is high.

The research was based on data of temporary immigrants (sojourners), being international students who reside in the Netherlands and participants of a Dutch language course (total N = 163). Questionnaires were used to collect data at two time points (time lag: 3 months). Findings from multiple regression analyses reveal that an increase in L2 proficiency is related to a positive change in two indicators of cultural integration: identification with the host society and attitudes towards the host culture. An increase in L2 proficiency appears to be related to a positive change in terms of identification, regardless of sojourners’ personality traits. With respect to attitudes towards the host culture, however, we find that increasing L2 proficiency only goes together with a positive change in attitudes towards the host culture for sojourners with a high degree of social initiative. Another notable finding is that, in the time period that this study was conducted, sojourners with a high degree of openness became more positive in their attitudes towards the host culture, regardless of the progress they made in terms of L2 proficiency. Results from this study cautiously suggest the importance of social perceptual personality traits in the cultural integration of sojourners. In line with this, institutional policies on the L2 learning of sojourners, including the training of social perceptual personality traits, could be recommendable.}

There is also a lack of agreement in the interpretation and measurement of constructs underlying the notion of changing ethnicity. In an effort to resolve these differences, this study initially presents a conceptual framework for changing ethnicity by delineating and then integrating its key underlying aspects. This is followed by the development and validation of a multidimensional measure of acculturation for Italian Canadians-one aspect of their ethnic change. Construct validation is based on confirmatory factor analyses of the multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) data. Once validated, the measure is used for an investigation of the relationships between acculturation and some aspects of gender-role perceptions of Italian-Canadian spouses.

  Abstract = {This study investigates factors predicting acculturation strategies among potential ethnic migrants prior to their migration. 325 potential migrants from Russia to Finland were surveyed at the pre-migration stage. Factors studied included perceived acculturation expectations of the members of the receiving society, values, cultural identities, general well-being, self-efficacy, cultural knowledge, social networks in the new home country, language proficiency, perceived cultural similarity, support for multicultural ideology and perceived discrimination in the country of origin. In line with the hypotheses, the respondents preferred integration over assimilation, separation and marginalisation strategies. Discriminant analysis was computed to distinguish integrationists, assimilationists and separationists, resulting in two functions that discriminated between the groups. The most important predictors explaining pre-migration acculturation attitudes were the perceptions potential migrants have of future hosts' preferences for immigrants' cultural maintenance and contacts with hosts. In addition, general well-being, Russian identity and support for multicultural ideology significantly predicted acculturation attitudes in the pre-migration stage. The study highlights the importance of acknowledging that acculturation begins already at the pre-migration stage. It contributes to our understanding of pre-acculturation in general and factors affecting the formation of pre-migration acculturation attitudes in particular. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.}

The 307 members of 96 families who actually immigrated were interviewed again approximately 3 years later. Their satisfactions with many aspects of their lives and their performances in several roles were assessed by a variety of methods. Adaptation was treated as a multi‐faceted process, and the immigrants were found to differ in level of adaptation from one area to another. The measures of subjective adaptation tended to be more highly intercorrelated than were the measures of role performance. Twenty‐six such measures of adaptation were related to 11 characteristics assessed on the pretest, yielding a number of different prediction patterns, depending on the outcome variable considered. The most generally useful predictors of adaptation were experience with diverse cultures, fluency in English, emotional health, socio‐economic status, optimism about prospects, (low) affiliative dependence, family solidarity, and interpersonal ties in the former community. 1985 Australian Psychological Society}

  Abstract = {This article investigates the embodied experiences of a group of professional sports labour migrants whose experiences have largely been ignored by sociological literature: southern hemisphere rugby players playing professional rugby league in the United Kingdom. The migrant pathway from Australasia to the UK is well established. Moreover, rugby league is a sport in which debate concerning the merits of employing labour migrants from Australasia is prevalent and ongoing. The study used interview and questionnaire data to investigate the embodied experiences facing this group of migrant professionals. Migrant experiences prior to migrating were contoured by access to resources and by the formal and informal relationships developed through professional and personal careers. The embodied and complex nature of contractual negotiations is highlighted. The centrality of embodied migrant identity and habitus is noted in relation to acculturation strategies adopted over time and space, both prior to and during a foreign sojourn, in terms of established and outsider groups. The paper also highlights how subgroups within a more general group of labour migrants can emerge. Furthermore, the complex influence of personal and professional relationships was found to be both enabling and constraining. These differences between subgroups are considered in light of previous work on acculturation strategies and the existential nature of migration. Future research requirements in the sports labour migration field are suggested.}

These items were combined to form an acculturation scale. We performed psychometric analysis of scale properties. Greater duration of residence in the U.S., greater percentage of lifetime in the U.S., and younger age at immigration were associated with more acculturated responses to the items for Asian Indians. Item-scale correlations for the 11-item acculturation scale ranged from 0.28–0.55 and internal consistency reliability was 0.73. Some support was found for a two-factor solution; one factor corresponding to cultural activities (α = 0.70) and the other to social behaviors (α = 0.59). Temporal measures only partially capture the full dimensions of acculturation. Our scale captured several domains and possibly two dimensions of acculturation.}

Bivariate correlations and independent samples t tests assessed SASH correlation with acculturation proxies and relationships between proxies, SASH, and sociodemographics. SASH was highly correlated with commonly used acculturation proxies; inter-scale correlations and alpha scores were high. Sociodemographics associated with proxy variables were associated with SASH. In conclusion, SASH is useful and valid for assessing acculturation among Hispanics; however, a shortened version or acculturation proxy variables could also be utilized. © Springer 2011.}

Neuroticism, openness to experience and agreeableness emerged as significant predictors of integration and marginalisation (except agreeableness) strategies and acculturative stress. A hierarchical regression analysis revealed neuroticism, openness to experience and marginalisation as significant predictors of acculturative stress. The results suggest that both personality traits and mode of acculturation account for significant variance in the experience of acculturative stress. © 2012 Department of Psychology, University of Allahabad.}

Anxious attachment was associated with heightened intragroup marginalization from friends and, in turn, with increased acculturative stress; anxious attachment was also associated with increased intragroup marginalization from family. Avoidant attachment was linked with increased intragroup marginalization from family and, in turn, with decreased subjective well-being.}

According to Ward and colleagues, both psychological and sociocultural adaptation change at different rates and extend into later life. For this study, participants 50+ years of age and born in Iran completed questionnaires measuring life satisfaction, depressive symptoms, acculturation, and demographic and sociocultural variables (e.g., pre- and post-immigration occupational status). We collected study data anonymously in Persian to obtain responses from long-term residents of Canada as well as more recent immigrants who may not read or write English. We examined both life satisfaction and (the absence of) depressive symptoms as distinct forms of psychological adaptation; these emerged as independent predictors of acculturation. Contrary to theory, acculturation appears to predict life satisfaction, not vice versa; moreover, there seems to be no direct link between depressive symptoms and acculturation. Our findings suggest that integration within Canadian society is associated with higher life satisfaction. In contrast, sociocultural factors are indirectly associated with life satisfaction (except age) and acculturation (except ethnic diversity of social interactions). Involuntary migrants reported higher levels of depression, whereas loss of occupational status is associated with reduced life satisfaction. Implications for future research and health policy are discussed.}

This mixed-methods study conducted among Afghan and Iraqi refugee and asylum-seeker psychiatric patients aims to fill this gap. Associations between postmigration stress, symptoms of anxiety and depression disorders, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder were significant. When differentiated for the two groups, associations with postmigration stress were no longer significant for Afghan patients, who were predominantly younger and more often single, lower educated, and without resident status compared with Iraqi patients. Qualitative results indicate that, in addition to psychopathology and postmigration stress, acculturation problems contribute to confusion of cultural identity. The findings suggest that reduction of postmigration stress and acculturation problems may clarify cultural identity and as such may contribute to posttraumatic recovery.},

Informed by Bornstein’s Specificity Principle in Acculturation Science, acculturation was defined by levels of: language acquisition, having realised/met expectations, and self-identification with host country. Using a cross-sectional study design, a convenience sample of English-speaking participants was recruited through a link on a well-known English-language internet site targeting immigrants to Israel. Due to the diversity of respondents, only questionnaires completed by immigrants from the following four countries were included (n = 641): Canada (n = 40), South Africa (n = 66), the United Kingdom (n = 132) and the United States (n = 403). Life satisfaction only was linked to the acculturation variable of having a higher level of realised expectations for life after immigration and reporting good health, but not associated with the other acculturation variables of language acquisition or self-identification with host country. While having realised expectations was related to life satisfaction, the number of years in the host country and language acquisition was not. Having realistic expectations (related to greater life satisfaction) may be increased by providing prospective immigrants information on the new country’s culture while they are still in the host country and planning their immigration.}

The first is Immersion within the Society of Origin (ISO), which has two facets: "Orientation towards Members of the Ingroup" (OMI) and "Orientation towards the culture of origin" (OCO). The second, "Immersion within the Host Society" (IHS) also comprises two facets: Orientation towards People of French Origin" (OPFO) and Orientation towards French Culture" (OFC). The aim was to analyse the relationship between these four facets of sociocultural acculturative orientations and various socio-demographic and psychosocial variables. Two-hundred-and-ten North African immigrants in France answered a questionnaire adapted from Stephenson's Multigroup Acculturation Scale (SMAS). Stepwise multiple regression analyses show that OMI is linked to the country of origin and cultural identity, and OCO to satisfaction with life, family situation, sex and cultural identity. OPFO is linked to participation in club activities, and OFC to work/student activity and family situation. These results illustrate the relevance and value of studying immigrants' sociocultural, acculturative orientation on the basis of ISO vs. IHS models, and in the fields of their social relations and their relationship with the culture. They highlight the importance of looking at acculturation as a composite process, the various facets of which are related to different variables that can therefore be regarded as relevant indicators of immigrants' intercultural adaptation.}

It was found that while the immigrant groups did not increase their total media consumption, their consumption across different media types followed both assimilation and ethnic affirmation models.

Methods: The participants were 250 Italian native and 100 immigrant adults who completed a questionnaire with items to measure their acculturation strategies (real plane) and attitudes (ideal plane), in general and related to different life domains (peripheral and central). Results: Results revealed that the acculturation attitude of immigrants is integration, whereas Italians prefer their assimilation. Conclusion: However, when different life domains are taken into account, immigrants claim to put in practice and prefer integration in most of the domains, whereas Italians perceive immigrants are separated but they prefer their assimilation or integration, depending on the specific domain.

  Abstract = {Background The process of becoming a humanitarian migrant is potentially damaging to mental health. We examined the association between pre-migration and post-migration potentially traumatic events and stressors and mental health, and assessed the moderating effect of post-migration stressors in humanitarian migrants in Australia. Methods In this study, we used the first wave of data between 2013 and 2014 from the Building a New Life in Australia survey. The survey included 2399 migrants who had arrived in Australia holding a permanent humanitarian visa 3–6 months preceding the survey, with 77\% and 23\% of participants being granted visas through offshore and onshore humanitarian programmes, respectively. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was measured with the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder 8 items (PTSD-8) and severe mental illness was measured with the Kessler Screening Scale for Psychological Distress (K6). Pre-migration potentially traumatic events and post-migration stressors related to asylum process and resettlement were measured with a self-reported questionnaire. Findings Of the 2399 participants, 762 (31\%; 95\% CI 29·4–33·2) had PTSD and 394 (16\%; 95\% CI 14·2–17·2) had severe mental illness. The mean number of pre-migration potentially traumatic events was 2·1 (SD 1·4). 64\%, 59\%, 49\%, and 18\% of participants reported poor social integration, economic problems, worrying about family or friends overseas, and loneliness as post-migration stressors. Pre-migration potentially traumatic events and post-migration stressors were positively associated with PTSD and severe mental illness. Factors significantly modifying the association between pre-migration potentially traumatic events and mental health after controlling for confounding factors were resettlement related stressors, including loneliness (odds ratio 1·17, 95\% CI 1·05–1·28 for PTSD and 1·28, 1·16–1·41 for severe mental illness) and the number of social integration stressors (1·10, 1·05–1·16 for PTSD). Interpretation Our data suggest that post-migration resettlement-related stressors were the most important correlates of mental health in humanitarian migrants, accounting for both direct and indirect associations. Targeting resettlement-related stressors through augmenting psychosocial care programmes and social integration would be a key approach to improve humanitarian migrants' mental health.

  Abstract = {Berry (1990) distinguished four acculturation attitudes (integration, assimilation, separation and marginalization) arising from two acculturation questions (concerning cultural maintenance and cultural contact). This research examines the distributions of acculturation attitudes based on his original cultural maintenance-cultural contact conceptualization and on a later cultural maintenance-cultural adoption model. In line with the Relative Extended Acculturation Model it also compares the outcomes of real (self-reported behavioral) and ideal (attitudinal) assessments of acculturation. Two hundred and eighty-nine first generation immigrants in New Zealand participated in the study. In line with the hypotheses, integration occurred more frequently when derived from cultural contact than from cultural adoption and when acculturation was framed in attitudinal, rather than behavioral, terms. The findings point to the necessity of clearly defining the dimensions of acculturation, ensuring they are appropriately operationalized, and differentiating attitudinal and self-reported behavioral measures. The consequences of the operationalization of acculturation for its relationship to adaptation are also reported and discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.}

  Abstract = {This study applies facet theory to validate Berry’s bidimensional conceptualization and measurement of acculturation attitudes and its extension by Horenczyk to include acculturation expectations. Three components of facet theory (mapping sentence, confirmatory SSA [smallest space analysis], and SSA with external variables) are proposed as valuable tools for the purpose of cross-cultural validation and theory building. In total, 526 Israeli immigrants from the former Soviet Union completed questionnaires assessing own and "perceived expected" acculturation attitudes, as well as a questionnaire measuring the strength of their cultural identities. The bidimensional "radex" configuration of acculturation attitudes confirms expected distinctions (a) between integration, separation, assimilation, and marginalization types of acculturation attitudes and (b) between similarly structured own immigrants’ attitudes and the expectations attributed to hosts. Moreover, the distinct placement of group identifications and sociodemographic characteristics as external variables in the bidimensional space corroborates the concurrent and discriminant validity of the acculturation model and measurement.}

  Abstract = {A world-wide internet survey was conducted to test central assumptions of a recent theory of cultural transmission in minorities proposed by the authors. 844 1st to 2nd generation immigrants from a wide variety of countries recruited on a microjob platform completed a questionnaire designed to test eight hypotheses derived from the theory. Support was obtained for all hypotheses. In particular, evidence was obtained for the continued presence, in the immigrants, of the culture-transmission motive postulated by the theory: the desire to maintain the culture of origin and transmit it to the next generation. Support was also obtained for the hypothesized anchoring of the culture-transmission motive in more basic motives fulfilled by cultural groups, the relative intra- and intergenerational stability of the culture-transmission motive, and its motivating effects for action tendencies and desires that support cultural transmission under the difficult conditions of migration. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the assumption that people have a culture-transmission motive belongs to the folk psychology of sociocultural groups, and that immigrants regard the fulfillment of this desire as a moral right.

  Abstract = {Domestic violence against women is an oppressive condition extended across race, class, and gender in the United States (Sokoloff, \& Pratt 2005; U.S. Department of Justice, 2004). Athena's (2000) discussion the English Common Law of 1967 in the context of wife abuse was supported by Stedman's (1917) statement that, 'by the old common law rule the husband had the right to inflict moderate personal chastisement on his wife, provided that he used, as some of his domestic authorities stated it, a switch no longer than his thumb' (p. 1). This study examined the help-seeking behavior of women of Hispanic origin who have been in situations of domestic violence. In particular, it is focused on the perceptions of Mexican immigrant and Mexican American women regarding the social services available to them (Tiefenthaler, Farmer, \& Sambira, 2005). It also explored how this help-seeking behavior is affected by their degree of acculturation and the incidence of intimate partner violence. I wanted to understand whether a difference existed between these two similar ethnic groups. I reviewed their differences in perception about their situation, as well as their awareness of the quality of social services available to them. The participants in this study were 10 Mexican immigrant and 7 Mexican American women who were living in Memphis, Tennessee when the research was conducted. In order to investigate the phenomena, mixed methods were used. The quantitative instruments selected were ARSMA-II (Cuéllar \& Maldonado,1995), the Inventory of Abusive Behavior (Shepard \& Campbell, 1992), and a customized demographic questionnaire. The qualitative data were collected through a semi-structured interview. Descriptive data and t-tests were reported for the quantitative data, and constant comparative analysis (Glaser, 1965) supported the interpretation of the qualitative data. I report the challenges that women of Hispanic origin had while seeking help from social service providers and the relationship between acculturation and incidence of intimate partner violence. Recommendations to improve the quality of services that this population receives, as well as suggestions for future research, are provided.

  Abstract = {Using a sample of youth with a Turkish background living in Germany, the study aimed to identify their cultural identifications and acculturation attitudes, and test the effects of cultural identifications together with background variables on cognitive and affective aspects of subjective well-being. Measures of identification with the Turkish and German cultures, Turkish identity, German identity, dual identity, life satisfaction, and positive and negative affect were used. The most favored acculturation strategy was integration followed by separation. Whereas heritage-culture identification and mainstream-culture identification were found to be independent of each other, both contributed to the well-being of immigrants, with the former predicting affective and the latter predicting cognitive well-being. Turkish identity, German identity, as well as dual identity as both Turkish and German contributed to the well-being of the youth. Besides, dual identification had a unique contribution to well-being outcomes above and beyond other acculturation variables. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.}

  Abstract = {Objectives: This study sought to measure the prevalence of smoking among the Hmong, Vietnamese, Lao, and Cambodian communities of Minnesota and explore the relationship between smoking and acculturation within these communities. Methods: A community-based participatory research framework was used through all phases of this study. Standard as well as community-developed measures of acculturation were used. Data were obtained by face-to-face and telephone interviews with 1,628 respondents from July 2006 to March 2007. Results: Vietnamese and Cambodian men smoke at higher rates than men in the U.S. general population (35\% and 58\% compared with 20\%, respectively). Most men across the Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Lao populations started smoking prior to immigration to the United States, although most former smokers quit smoking after immigration to the United States. Most male Hmong respondents started smoking after immigration. Education was predictive of smoking status across genders, with less education associated with greater odds of being a smoker. Logistic regression found some acculturation measures to be predictive of smoking status across both genders: Less acculturated male respondents and more acculturated female respondents are more likely to be smokers. Discussion: Results of this study suggest that the role of acculturation in tobacco use may not be straightforward as has been presented previously. Other factors, such as social norms and cultural or linguistic isolation, may also be playing a role in tobacco use patterns and may play different roles for different subgroups. Further research is needed within each population and subgroups within those populations to understand these relationships and how they affect smoking behavior © The Author 2010.},

This study investigated gender and acculturation differences in TB-specific Health Belief Model (HBM) constructs, and the applicability of the HBM's traditional configuration to Mexican Americans. Acculturation and gender substantially influenced the findings. Traditional Mexican Americans reported higher perceived susceptibility and seriousness, more barriers, and greater attention to cues regarding TB prevention than Highly Integrated Biculturals. Women reported greater benefits, attention to cues, and intent to engage in TB prevention behaviors than men. Highly Integrated Bicultural men reported less attention to cues and less intent to engage in health behaviors than other groups. The traditional HBM configuration did not fit this sample. Reconfiguration did, however, result in adequate fit. Overall, higher perceived susceptibility, action benefits, attention to media cues, and female gender predicted greater intent to engage in TB health behaviors.},

A necessary step in using a database for cross-ethnic comparisons is first to verify whether its items and scales are equivalent. I examined item- and scale-level differential functioning (DF; n = 4,663, six ethnic minority groups) on four of the database’s sociocultural scales: Feelings About School (11 items), Relational Family Efficacy (four items), Being Bullied (five items), and Perceived Teacher Discrimination (four items) using an item response theory (IRT)–based framework. Findings demonstrated no meaningful DF on items and, in most cases, scales as well. Second, distinct ethnic group patterns are present. Third, the Perceived Teacher Discrimination scale was not functioning for the majority of the ethnic minority groups which is of grave concern.

American acculturation predicted greater levels of social support from cross-race friends. For same-race friendships, students who went to schools with higher percentage of Asian students reported more same-race friendships; however, percentage of Asian students was not a significant predictor of social support from same-race friends. Students who reported greater levels of Vietnamese acculturation reported greater levels of social support from their same-race friends.

This study examined the association of ethnic drinking culture, acculturation, and enculturation with alcohol drinking among male immigrants in Taiwan. This cross-sectional survey recruited 188 male immigrants. Ethnic drinking culture was divided into dry and wet according to per capita alcohol consumption and abstinent rate in the countries of origin in reference to that in Taiwan. A scale, Bidimensional Acculturation Scale for Marriage-Based Immigrants, was developed to measure acculturation (adaptation to the host culture) and enculturation (maintenance of the original culture). Drinking patterns (abstinent, low-risk drinking, and hazardous drinking) were determined by scores on the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test. There was a significant interaction between ethnic drinking culture and enculturation/acculturation on drinking patterns. Multinomial logistic regression models identified that for those from dry ethnic drinking cultures, a high level of acculturation was associated with increased low-risk drinking, while a high level of enculturation was associated with decreased low-risk drinking. For those from wet ethnic drinking cultures, a low level of acculturation and high level of enculturation were associated with increased hazardous drinking. High family socioeconomic status was associated with increased drinking, while perceived insufficient family income was positively associated with hazardous use. To prevent hazardous use of alcohol, health education should be targeted at immigrant men who drink, especially among those who have economic problems, are from wet ethnic drinking cultures, and demonstrate low adaptation to the host culture.}

  Abstract = {Introduction: We analyzed the association between different acculturation measures and smoking among pregnant immigrant women from Turkey and compared smoking rates between Turkish and German women. Methods: Perinatal data from a project on the influence of migration and acculturation on pregnancy and birth in Berlin was analyzed. An acculturation index (FRAKK) and two proxy measures (German language proficiency, length of stay in Germany) were used. We performed logistic regression models and calculated age-standardized prevalence ratios (SPR). Results: Smoking prevalence was 19.8\% among pregnant Turkish women (n = 702) and 17.8\% among German women (n = 2,999). The chance of being a smoker was significantly higher among Turkish women with a length of stay of ≥20 years compared to 0-4 years (OR = 3.63, 95\% CI = 1.64-8.05); with good/very good language skills compared to none/minor skills; with high levels of acculturation compared to low levels (the latter only among 18-29-year-old women). Compared to German women, Turkish women with a short length of stay, low acculturation scores and none/minor language skills had lower smoking rates. This finding inverts with long length of stay, high acculturation scores and good/very good language skills (≥20 years: SPR = 2.14, 95\% CI = 1.56-2.94). Conclusions: Smoking among pregnant Turkish women increases with increasing acculturation. Additionally, immigrant women with a low acculturation level are less often smokers and women with a high level are more often smokers than German women. Prevention measures have to prevent women with a low acculturation from starting to smoke and to induce those with a high acculturation to quit. As smoking and acculturation are group phenomena, it is necessary to involve immigrant communities.},
