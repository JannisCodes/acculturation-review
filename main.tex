% Abstract
\abstract{
\Warning\ Needs to be updated! One of the key challenges to researching acculturation is an immense heterogeneity in definitions and measures. These inconsistencies make it difficult to compare past literature on acculturation, hinder straight-forward measurement selections, and hampers the development of an overarching framework. To structure our understanding of the migration process, we propose to use the four basic elements of human experiences (motivations, emotions, thoughts, and behaviors) as a descriptive framework. We then embed this migration experience structure within the individual socio-historical context. To test our framework, we perform a systematic review and separately analyse validated scales and empirical studies in their measurements of motivational, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral acculturation aspects. We find that most scales and studies focus on behavioral and cognitive operationalisations. We inversely find that emotional and motivational aspects are measured rarely and predominantly in conjunction with other experience elements. We also find structural differences acculturation measures across publication fields. We, thus, showcase the utility of an experience-based framework in structuring our analyses and understandings of acculturation.

%% Relevance:
% Migration as a growing societal debate
Migration is a complex human experience of change and the process of adapting to this change. The adaptation of migrants in new cultural contexts is an important issue in many societies around the world. With many of the migration push and pull factors in the economic, safety, social, and environmental domains worsening, the topic is likely to become even more important in the future \citep[e.g.,][]{InternationalOrganizationforMigration2020}.
The current challenges and increasing migration highlight once more how important it is to understand how adaptation processes unfold and which aspects are most important to positive and sustainable outcomes. 

%% Problem:
% Heterogeneity leads to challenges of: comparison, inclusion/focus decision in research and interventions, and overarching framework
One of the fundamental challenges to psychological integration, faced by researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers, is an essentially scattered field with immense heterogeneity in definitions and measures of individual cultural adaptation
\footnote{\textbf{I know this is way too long and we should probably just use `acculturation' and make a note that we mean the original meaning.} Researchers have used a wide range of terms in the context of cultural interactions, including acculturation, enculturation, transculturation, assimilation, integration, and cultural adaptation, -adjustment, or -transition. While there are often important conceptual differences between the terms, they all aim to capture and describe a process of change when two cultures interact. In this paper we will mostly use the term \textit{cultural adaptation}. The term `adaptation' in its etymology takes a functional approach -- where both individuals and interactive systems adjust to be better suited for their environment. In this understanding, cultural adaptation is (1) relevant on an individual- and a group level, (2) places responsibility on any individual and group in the environment, and (3) is inherently a temporal and interactive process. Note that we do not specify what exactly is adaptive in any circumstance and that 'adaptation' is not a necessary outcome (i.e., many change processes do not enhance the livability of groups or individuals). Cultural adaptation rather seems to be a target that underlies most measures and definitions in the field. We also want to highlight that the term (psychological) acculturation was originally referred to as a neutral and descriptive umbrella term, which shares many of these attributes (e.g., \citealp{Berry2003}). Yet, we chose not to use acculturation as our primary term because over the past 90 years users of the term have most frequently used it in a static manner \citep{Brown2011, Ward2019} and have placed disproportional responsibility on migrants \citep{Bourhis1997a} -- despite its more neutral original intention \citep[e.g.,][]{Berry2009a}. We believe that part of this confusion stems from the word itself, where the ac- prefix indicates a movement (of an individual) towards a cultured end-state. Yet, because the term \textit{acculturation} is often used in the psychological literature and the term \textit{integration} is widely used in societal debates, we will, at times, use these terms interchangeably with cultural adaptation.}.
The inconsistency of included and excluded aspects brings researchers and practitioners to face fundamental challenges when (1) looking back at past literature and interventions, because it becomes hard to compare different effects and outcomes, (2) when looking forward, it becomes hard to choose a definition and measurement for new research and intervention efforts, and (3) more generally, the scattered state of the literature hampers the development of an overarching framework.

%% Solution/Aim:
% Propose and test a framework to analyse, measure, and understand cultural adaptation.
The aim of this paper is, therefore, to offer a descriptive conceptual framework to analyse, measure, and understand the concept of individual cultural adaptation. Such a framework has a different objective than previous efforts to catalogue literature on cultural adaptation \citep[e.g.,][]{Castels2003}, build multidimensional measures of integration \citep[e.g.,][]{Harder2018}, normative frameworks \citep[e.g.,][]{Ager2008a}, or theories of acculturation \citep[e.g.,][]{Berry2005}. Rather than offering a new measurement, definition, or theory, we aim to build a framework to assess and compare any of these conceptual elements. 
We propose to do so by using the basic elements of human experiences and motivation to structure the concept of cultural adaptation.
Once we have introduced our conceptual framework, we will systematically review the past methodological and applied empirical literature on acculturation to apply our framework and tests its utility. \\

\section{The Framework: Embedded Migration Experiences}
%% Structure of the section: 
% Both widely applicable structuring but also context.
The utility of a conceptual framework arguably depends on its ability to comprehensively structure a concept and to do so across a wide range of contexts. Yet, at the same time, the contexts should not remain a black box. In the following sections we will, thus, introduce both our structuring framework and our conceptualization of context in more detail (also see Figure \ref{fig:ModelContext} for an overview).

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}

\subsection{The Migration Experience}
%% Proposal: 
% Use human experience to structure our understanding of cultural adaptation.
To build a framework that captures the complex process of cultural adaptation and is applicable across a heterogeneous field, we chose to focus on basic psychological faculties relevant to all human beings --- across contexts and time scales. A growing body of literature suggests that any human experience can be understood as a set of needs, emotions, cognitions, and behaviors \citep[sometimes referred to as the ABCs or ABCDs of psychology: affect, behavior, cognition, desire; e.g.,][]{Cottam2010, Hogg2005, Jhangiani2014}. Following the premise that any human experience can be perceived within these four basic elements, we propose that the migration experience (i.e., cultural adaptation) can also be structured as a set of motives, emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. 

%% Example: 
% Examples of ABCD in cultural adaptation.
Cultural adaptation in this framework might, for example, be understood or measured in terms of behavioral adaptation, such as language use, or voting; cognitive adaptation, such as identification with cultural values; affective adaptation, such as feeling at home, or loneliness; motivational adaptation, such as the satisfaction of competence or independence needs; or as a complex combination of any or all of these aspects. 

%% Features of Experience Framework: 
% ABCD comprehensively captures experience, is a scale-able evaluation, and universally relevant across contexts.
Using the building blocks of human experiences not only ensures that the framework comprehensively captures the entire migration experience, but experiences are also relevant across time-scales, because experience perceptions are scale-able evaluations --- of a single situation, a recent period, or a life-long journey \citep[e.g.,][]{Clewett2019}.
Moreover, there is also evidence that ABC(D) frameworks are universally relevant for all human beings\footnote{For a detailed discussion of the distinction between \textit{universalism} and \textit{absolutism} see \citet{Berry2000, Berry2009a}.}. The frameworks have, for example, been found across cultures \citep[e.g.,][]{Bhawuk2011} and likely structure human forebrain functioning \citep{Swanson2020}\footnote{It should also be noted that ABC(D) frameworks have been used effectively to structure theories and models across a wide variety of fields --- including research on attitudes \citep{Breckler1984} and ambivalence \citep{VanHarreveld2015}, self-regulation \citep{Ben-Eliyahu2015}, the big five personality traits \citep{Wilt2016}, suicidality \citep{Harris2015} and in clinical interventions \citep{Eifert1989}, and even the review of acculturation literature \citep{Ward2001, Ward2019}. Interestingly, the affect, behavior, and cognition structure has even found application in the development of human-like machines \citep{Guo2020}.}.

%% Application: 
% Universality of elements allows us to ask: Which aspects have been considered? How many aspects have been considered? And which have been considered together?
% In this study we ask answer these questions for past literature.
These attributes of comprehensiveness, scale-ability, and universality are ideal for comparing and assessing different definitions and measurements in past and present literature. It allows us to ask questions such as: Which aspect of the migration experience has been considered as part of acculturation in a particular research project? Which aspect is measured most frequently in a certain field? Or what is the average number of aspects included in definitions or measurements? 
In the current paper, we will test some of these questions for the past empirical literature. In particular, we will assess which aspects of cultural adaptation have most frequently been included. And which aspects are most frequently considered together. We will also assess how many of the motivational, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral aspects are measured within the studies. Moreover, to assess differences between fields, we will also group past research based on the journals' target audience. 
% interesting: call for unpublished data or check in theses, whether different ABCD composition.

%% Experience as Critical Research Tool: 
% Thinking about experience forces you to take the perspective of your research participants.
Before we move on to the context of the migration experience, we would like to remark on a few important nuances of the framework. One important emphasis of the experience conceptualization is that it is inherently a bottom-up approach to the topic. Taking migration experiences as the starting-point highlights the considerations for the lived realities of the researched individuals and communities. Scholars in the traditions of critical research methods have long highlighted the importance of including the participants in the research conceptualization process \citep[e.g.,][]{Kovach2009}. If one uses the experiences of the researched individuals to guide the study questions and design, one inevitably emphasizes the agency and needs of the community -- lending relevance and ownership of knowledge to the community \citep[e.g., ][]{Schmidt2021}.

%% Experience Content:
% we focus on structure not on content.
One further important distinction is that while anyone will have motives, emotions, thoughts, and behaviors, what one needs (e.g., belongingness or independence), feels (e.g., sadness or happiness), thinks (e.g., identification or disinterest), or does (e.g., studying or working) is highly ideographic. It is this ideographic content that makes the framework relevant to such a broad range of migration contexts (see next section). Yet it is the content-free structure (i.e., the presence or absence of the basic elements) that is transferable across contexts and studies, enabling comparisons and broader conceptual discussion. In this paper, we will thus focus on the the latter structuring properties of the experience framework. That is, we will, for example, assess whether migrant behaviors or emotions were considered but not which behaviors or emotions were considered in particular. This allows us to start a broader discussion of the type cultural adaptation experience considered across the scattered field (inversely, considerations of particular emotions and behaviors will likely be important to individual studies of contexts).

\subsection{The Context}
%% Introduction context: 
% Experience depends on what is permitted by culture, situation, individual background, and time in the migration process.
The perceptions of an experience are often fundamentally influenced by the context and environment of the experience. Which perceptions a situation permits (i.e., contextual affordances) has long been a topic of discussion in the field of ecological psychology \citep[e.g.,][]{Cantor1994}. Recent efforts to formalize the structure of contexts have, for example, highlighted the interactive process of group-environments and individuals \citep[e.g.,][]{Young2002}.
Adjacent to these discussions in ecological psychology, we would like to address four contextual factors in particular: (1) Cultures, (2) individuals, (3) situations, and (4) the process.

\subsubsection{Culture} 
%% Introduction Culture: 
% Culture is prominent and should be structured for a widely applicable framework.
The most prominent contextual factor of cultural adaptation are probably the interacting cultures. 
Most (semi-)applied research projects might not need to consider or formalize the structural role of cultures --- because they can simply embed their research in the context of the two particular cultures they considered.
Yet, theories of acculturation and broader socio-cultural theories have long considered different conceptual influences of culture and society on the individual's experience. We will rely on these theories to guide our understanding of culture here\footnote{It should be noted that because our framework focuses on the individual acculturation experience, we will merely use the structuring elements of these sociological, anthropological, and psychological theories. Moreover, because these fields often use different terms to describe the same or similar concepts, our presentation here might not always be consistent with the original terminologies. Similarly, the individual theoretical and philosophical positions as well as their implications (and their criticisms) would be beyond the scope of our paper and will, thus, not be discussed here.}.

%% Culture as social facts: 
% social facts (formal: law, regulations, policies, history, language; informal: norms, values, beliefs, [e.g., roles, moral-, religious beliefs], rituals, customs, cultural products: fashion, architecture, arts [e.g., film, music, literature, art]) relate to the affordances of ABCD
Discussions within the sociological literature have long structured cultural influences and have related these influences directly to the psychological experiences. For example, functional structuralists have argued that social and cultural influences can be divided into informal social facts (e.g., norms, values, beliefs, rituals, customs), formal social facts \citep[e.g., laws, regulations, policies, history, language; also see][]{Herzog2018, Gilbert1989}, as well as more physical cultural products or artifacts \citep[e.g., food, fashion, architecture, or arts, such as film, music, literature, and fine arts; e.g., see][]{Alexander2001}. These external influences usually define expected patterns of behavior (e.g., dress or communication styles), cognition (e.g., sense of race-, class-, gender-, and sexual identities), emotions (e.g., expressions of emotions), and motivations (e.g., virtues and duties)\footnote{Interestingly, the concept of social facts originally directly referred to affect, behavior, and cognition (and potentially desires), when Durkheim wrote that social facts ``consist of manners of acting, thinking and feeling external to the individual, which are invested with a coercive power by virtue of which they exercise control over him'' \citep[][p. 52]{Durkheim1982}.}.

%% Interaction of multiple cultures: 
% Use Berry to highlight power imbalances of where once culture might be more influential than another.
In the case of cultural adaptation, an individual needs to deal with (at least) two sets of cultural influences --- their heritage culture and the culture of the new environment \citep[e.g., see models of][]{Berry1997b, Berry2006a}. This is particularly the case if there are cultural differences \citep[e.g.][]{Triandis2001} and the local cultural majority expects assimilation \citep[e.g.,][]{Berry1997b, Berry2003}. The individual will thus have to negotiate their individual response to cultural expectations\footnote{The structure of formal, informal, and physical dimensions of cultural adaptation also highlights the nefarious nature of tension between cultures because it showcases how deep power imbalances can run \citep[e.g., see][]{Bhatia2001}. Adaptation tensions will, for example, become apparent in formal or material elements, such as laws or language, but also extend to more informal elements, such as default expectations in communication or behavioral norms and customs.}.

Once we consider this encounter of multiple cultures within the structure of culture as social facts, it also becomes apparent that the experience framework may be ideally suited to discuss the concept of culture.
Functional structuralists assert that cultures can have informal, formal, and physical influences on emotions, behaviors, cognitions, and desires. At the same time, acculturation theories stress that cultural adaptation involves individual adjustments to the presence of multiple cultural influences.
The individual cultural adaptation experience (i.e., the individual experienced ABCD) is, thus, the ideal place to capture the adjustment to a tension in external influences on affect, behavior, cognition, and desire. Studying cultural adaptation in the experience framework then also allows us to reflect on which cultures' social facts are considered in the conceptualization of acculturation (by researchers and practitioners). As part of the analyses presented in this paper, we will offer such a reflection by extracting the cultures for which acculturation measures are used. This allows us to examine how much the external influences of culture on motives, emotions, thoughts, and behaviors are reflected within structural differences of measures and definitions (if the systematic review identifies cultural clusters with sufficient power to assess differences).

\subsubsection{Individual} 
%% Individual based on inter-group contact and Berry: 
% Individual differences in general (e.g., age, gender) but also migration related differences (e.g., reason for migration, language proficiency)
Another contextual factor to consider during the cultural adaptation process are the interacting individuals themselves. There has been a rising focus on the idea that acculturation centers around the daily interpersonal interactions a person has with people of the other group \citep{Maxwell2017, Sam2010}. And although it can, at times, be difficult to disentangle cultural from individual influences, there are a range of personal features that likely influence the cultural adaptation process. These personal differences might relate to relatively stable individual differences, such as gender or personality, but also migration related differences, such as the reason for migration (e.g., voluntary vs. forced migration), cultural distance, or migration status. Within the migration related factor we would also include aspects that might change over the course of the adaptation process but give migrants different starting positions, such as language skills and education level.
Similar to the influences of cultures, the individual differences of the interaction partners (if there are multiple people) will likely impact the cultural adaptation. And similar to culture, individual differences likely play a role for multiple aspects of the cultural adaptation process (also see Figure \ref{fig:ModelContext}). As part of this study, we will mainly analyze the migration relevant differences. Considering individual differences on a larger, cross-study level we will mainly extract data on the type of samples collected within the validation and the empirical papers (e.g., forced vs. voluntary, youth, or clinical samples). We will then assess whether these different samples show different patterns of cultural adaptation measures (i.e., differences in ABCD composition).

\subsubsection{Situation} 
%% Situations as domains of psycho-social functioning: 
% Many theories have come up with life domains that form different cultural interaction situations.
Beyond the cultural group and the individuals, the interactions of cultural adaptation are further dependent on the situational context. One way of structuring this situational context is what we will here refer to as the \textit{domains of psycho-social functioning} -- the idea that the social experience will take place within different domains in life. There are many social-scientific theories that have discussed these spheres of life. One famous example is Bronfenbrenner's Ecological systems theory \citep{Bronfenbrenner1992}, according to which humans get into contact with others, and society at large, through a number of environmental systems that range from the closest relations (e.g., family or colleagues) to the more remote relationships (e.g., mass media or societal services). A similar framework was suggested by prominent theorists of the (structural) functionalist traditions with the concept of social institutions \citep[e.g.,][]{Turner1997}. According to these sociological theorists, it is through societal institutions (commonly: family, government, economy, media, education, healthcare, and religion) that culture is transmitted and maintained \citep[e.g.,][]{Durkheim1982}. Similar ideas for domains of interaction with society and culture have also been proposed within the acculturation literature. \citet{Arends-Toth2006, Arends-Toth2007} have, for example, suggested 15 public and private life domains (e.g., education [public], child-rearing [private]) in which acculturation takes place. Empirical research in the individual acculturation field, have also provided evidence that acculturation processes can develop separately and differently within these situational domains \citep[e.g.,][]{Arends-Toth2003a}. 

%% Point of convergence: 
% We aggregate a list of micro to macro domains from past literature.
What structurally unites the conceptualizations of life domains is the dimension of closeness to the individual. That is, most areas of life found in the literature can be arranged from the most immediate (i.e., micro or private, such as family) to the broadest levels (i.e., macro or public, including government or media). So, based on sociological theories of social institutions \citep{Durkheim1982}, literature on life domains in acculturation \citep{Arends-Toth2006, Arends-Toth2007, Zane2004}, a categorization of psychological influences by the British Psychological Society \citep{Michie2005a}, and Bronfenbrenner's Ecological systems theory \citep{Bronfenbrenner1992}, we conceptualized a range of life domains relevant to the migration process (see Figure \ref{fig:ModelContext}). Interestingly, most methodological and empirical authors mention explicitly which domains of acculturation they measure or very clearly focus on a limited number of domains in their measurement or definition of acculturation. As part of this study we will, therefore, extract information on the domains mentioned and measured in the literature. We will then assess whether different foci on life domains also show differences in their understanding and measurement of the motivational, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral cultural adaptation.

\subsubsection{Process} 
%% Dynamic process rather than static end-product: 
% Experience can answer this call because it can only be understood based on past experiences
A final, fundamental factor we would like to address in the cultural adaptation framework is the understanding of cultural adaptation as a dynamic process rather than a static end-product. That cultural adaptation is a developmental process, and that ``acculturation occurs when two independent cultural groups come into \textit{continuous first-hand contact over an extended period of time}'' \citep[][186]{Berry1989} seem to be a generally accepted assumption within the field. Yet, within the empirical literature, few studies have actually considered the theoretical implications of migration as a process and even fewer have methodologically followed the trajectories of migrants over time. Recent years have seen a growing awareness of this discrepancy \citep[e.g.,][]{Brown2011, Ward2019}. We believe that the experience framework of cultural adaptation, as it is presented here, is ideally suited to deal with this conceptualization as a developmental process. Philosophers of the phenomenological tradition have long highlighted that subjective experience can only be understood within the history of past experiences \citep[e.g.,][; also see Figure \ref{fig:ModelContext}]{Heidegger1867}. In this study we apply our interest in the role of time by extracting the types of analyses (static vs. dynamic) done by the authors, and assessing whether data was collected prior to migration, after migration, or both. We will then also assess whether cross-sectional and longitudinal studies show differences in their understanding and measurement of the motivations, emotions, thoughts, and behaviors aspects of cultural adaptation, if the systematic review includes a reasonable number of longitudinal studies.

\section{The present study}
The aim of our empirical efforts presented here is to put our proposed framework to the test. We have lamented that one of the challenges of a heterogeneous field is that it is difficult to assess and compare past literature. As a framework, we have suggested that the psychological elements of experiences could comprehensively structure our assessment of the literature. We will thus retrieve the past psychological literature that has proposed or used a measure of cultural adaptation and we will extract which experiential elements were considered in the research. We expect that these efforts will provide insights into the perceived importance of motives, emotions, cognitions, and behaviors for cultural adaptation. We also expect that this allows us to assess how many experience aspects are usually considered and which aspects are considered jointly. And finally, we aim to compare the understanding of cultural adaptation across different contexts and fields. 

To test the utility of the framework, we specifically target the measurement of cultural adaptation as an operationalization of the concept within the empirical literature. We will first consider methodological literature, which aims to develop acculturation measures. Validated scales usually focus on a concept in general rather than aspects only relevant to a specific `applied' investigation. Coding cultural adaptation measures separately might also aid future considerations of measure selection because we effectively build a data base of scales that can be filtered by whether the scale includes measurements of motives, emotions, thoughts, or behaviors. Once we have considered the validated scales in particular, we will further assess the empirical literature that measures of cultural adaptation in general. Thus, in the following section we will briefly discuss how we extract key information from the literature and will then sequentially analyze the role of experience elements in the methodological and broader empirical literature of psychological cultural adaptation.

\Question\ Potentially Paragraph on: Why not meta analysis? (main problem: comparability across studies. Too diverse and scattered but also at different places in the model)

\section{Systematic Review}
%% Search Strategy:
To assess the past psychological literature on cultural adaptation, we performed a systematic review. On March 4\textsuperscript{th}, 2020, we searched for empirical work on the acculturation of migrants within the ``APA PsycInfo'' bibliographic databases via the EBSCO\textit{host} provider (for the full information on the search strategy see Appendix \ref{app:AppendixSearchStrategy}). We downloaded all references and abstracts, which two independent coders screened for relevance -- first based on the titles and then based on the abstracts. We downloaded all relevant and available works for full-text coding. We used this database to identify validated scales in the literature as well as empirical work in general. For both groups of work we extracted a range of variables to test our framework. Before we describe each of the two data sets in more detail we will briefly lay out how we extracted the variables for our main analyses. The full coding process and data extraction is described in the online supplementary materials \hl{X} (as well as on \hl{citation to public osf and/or github repository goes here}).

\subsection{Framework Coding}
For our main tests of the proposed framework we extracted data on the experience elements as well as the experience context.
\subsubsection{Experience Elements}
One major focus of our coding efforts was identifying the experience elements that were assessed within each manuscript. For each article we, thus, retrieved the items used and coded whether the measure included references to emotions (affect), behaviours, cognitions, and needs. Because this concerned the most central aspect of our framework, each manuscript was double-coded and inconsistent codes were resolved after discussion. Examples of how individual aspects were identified and coded are in Table \ref{tab:DimensionExamples}.
\input{Tables/tabDimEx}

At this stage we also noted if items measured concepts that are complex and relate to multiple experience aspects. As an example, a single item asking about `satisfaction with the new life' might include emotional and cognitive elements. In this case, we code the manuscript as measuring both emotions and cognitions, but note that these elements are not measured independently. We also noted if the measures do not consider an individual's experiences, such as reporting migration status or length of residency.

\subsubsection{Experience Context}
As part efforts to capture the migration context we were interested in cultural, individual, situational, as well as process related contexts. Assessing these contexts in a manner that is relevant across a wide range of studies is challenging and likely superficial at best. Context is arguably more relevant if one considers a single case, yet gaining a more general understanding of the contexts frequently considered in the literature could prove useful in evaluating and comparing conceptions of cultural adaptation. We, thus, extracted a range of general context variables from the empirical literature.

\paragraph{Cultural Context}
To capture the cultural contexts researched, we coded both the heritage country of the migrants as well as the country of the receiving host society. Coding the two societal contexts allows us to extract information on the specificity of the studies (e.g., Mexican migrants in the United States, vs any migrant in Scandinavia). Migrant and host country coding could also reveal patterns of interest within the literature (e.g., common migrant groups, common host societies, or common combinations investigated). And finally, if common clusters emerge, we could compare the types of experience elements assessed within each cluster (e.g., focus on behavioral adaptation in one and cognitive focus in another cluster). 

\paragraph{Sample}
To capture the individual background on a cross-paper level, we extract the types of samples recruited by the authors. Some studies might focus on young or elderly samples, men or women only, clinical samples, or authors might simply recruit any migrant from a certain country or region. Clusters and differences in the experience foci within these clusters might offer insights into the understanding of cultural adaptation for different individual contexts.

\paragraph{Life Domains}
To capture the situational focus of the authors, we coded which life domains the scales referred to. There were a range of ways in which we could identify the domains the authors wished to cover. Often times authors will explicitly mention which life domains their measure aims to capture. Others will mention clear domain focus as part of sub-scale or factor labels. If there is no explicit mention by the authors, questions are likely worded to refer to a specific life domain (e.g., behaviors at school, or values in the family context). If there is no clear reference to a life domain or the questions are about life in general, we code this as meaningful information as well. We can then process the situational foci as a list of domains, which offers information on the diversity of domains (e.g., number, or similarity of domains) but also the focus in the literature in general (e.g., frequency of domain across all articles). If clusters of similar focus domains emerge, we could, additionally, assess differences in the assessment of cultural adaptation for these clusters.

\paragraph{Migration Time}
To capture the process focus, we also coded which migration step(s) the authors focused on. We coded whether the authors focused on the migration experience after the arrival in the new society, prior to the migration, or focused on both time points. We, additionally, coded whether cross-sectional or longitudinal data was collected and how this data was analyzed. Given the observations of past reviews \citep[e.g.,][]{Brown2011, Ward2019}, we expect that most researchers will collect cross-sectional data at a single time-point after migration.

\section{Discussion}
%% Summary:
%Focus group discussion: behavior, cognition, affect, and desire clearly distinguished in the discussion of what is important in the field for a variety of societal players.
%Behavior and cognition have more expectations from host population and are more visible, affect and desire are more personal (i.e., less visible) but more powerful motor of change.

Literature review: complexity of dimensions and domains widely different between scales, studies, and fields. Cognition and behavior main focus across the board. Desire mostly in more complex measures and conceptualisations.

mention that we only compared between fields -- else too messy.

%% Host-Migrant Interconnectedness:
% Focus on migrant perspective because often disadvantaged position but any interdependent aspect should show up in ABCD + framework can also be used for majority perspective (but not focus of this paper)
Before we move on to the systematic review and our test of the conceptual framework, we would like to remark on our focus on the migrant's rather than the majority group member's experiences. 
While this framework explicitly focuses on the migrant's experience as the structuring experience, this is not meant to put the sole responsibility of ``migration success'' on the newcomer or ignore the interconnectedness of intercultural exchange. We focus on the migrant experience as the structuring element because migrants usually find themselves in disadvantaged positions. 

We would also like to address the issue of interactive acculturation. \citet{Bourhis1997a} and others, have often highlighted that cultural adaptation is essentially interactive and one should not consider the acculturation process of one individual or group without the consideration of the other group and the interaction partners. We agree, and while we address some of these issues explicitly in the framework, we would also like to highlight that within the experience framework aspects of cultural adaptation that are interconnected, co-dependent, or depend on the host majority members likely influence the individual's migration experience. As an example, if a migrant is frequently confronted with exclusion and hostility, this will likely affect their motivations, emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. 
We would also like to highlight that the framework is equally applicable to the cultural adaptation experience of host majority members in their interactions with or perceptions of migrants. Although not the focus of this paper, the same assessments of measures, definitions, and understandings should be able to be conducted with the experience of the majority group.
Additionally, this framework is not meant as an exhaustive or exclusive list of all adaptation aspects but rather offers a structural framework to analyze and understand the broad experience of cultural adaptation.
%Migration is a complex trans-formative experience within different areas of personal- and social life.

%% Use of the framework:
\textbf{Practitioners}: Focus group discussion: good grass-root level validation of the framework.

Useful for considering the concept in its personal complexity and to guide decisions in interventions, as well as monitoring and evaluations. 

\textbf{Researchers}: Literature review: framework good tool to describe measures, empirical work, and fields.

% Novel predictions: Thinking about ABCD aspects allows for new questions about focus, connections, and differences. Why is A, B, C, or D more important? What is the relationship between A, B, C, and D? Are internal aspects (D) more important than external aspects (B)?
Moreover, the structural framework also allows for novel questions and predictions. The structure, for example, allows for considerations of the relative importance, the interconnections, or the accessibility of these elements. There might, for example, be theoretical reasons why a certain aspect is more important to a specific issue (e.g., the role of emotions and cognitions to mental health; reference to theory here?). One could also offer process considerations, making theoretical arguments why a certain aspect might precede another or how one aspect might feed back into another (e.g., motivations guiding cognition and affect, which in turn drive behavior; reference to theory here? e.g., theory of reasoned goal pursuit). Another example, for a novel prediction could be a consideration of the accessibility of the individual aspects, where more public aspects, such as behaviors, might be seen as more important to the majority society, whereas more internal aspects such as motivations and goals might be more important to the newcomer (or their group; reference to theory here?). [\Warning\ maybe move to discussion?]

However, there might also be structural patterns one could assess and novel questions one can ask. One might, for example, assess which emotions were most frequently included in measures and definitions of acculturation \citep[e.g., specific emotions such as anger or pride, but also types of emotions, such as positive or negative, or about yourself or others;][]{DeLeersnyder2017}. One might also be interested in co-occurences of contents (e.g., within aspect: identifications and attitudes, but also between aspects: the need for belongingness and emotion of loneliness). It would also allow for conscious considerations of relationships within or between experience aspects. And these types of questions can be asked about past definitions and measurements (i.e., are there patterns in the literature), for a specific field (e.g., which emotions are relevant in the clinical context) or a specific cultural context (e.g., are there specific needs of Syrian refugees in Europe). 

Also offers framework for reflection on study conception and conscious decision of focus on dimensions and domains.

Framework and literature review can also be used as a database to selectively search measures and empirical results.
\subsection{Limitations}
As a psychological model it does not capture physical, cultural, or societal changes as part of the structural. Also ignores measures of integration that outside the agency of the migrant such as length of residence, immigration status, or discrimination experiences.

\subsection{Conclusion}
A person-centered framework based on core facets of the migrants’ experience and the environmental contexts of life domains offers a useful tool for both researchers and practitioners. Qualitative analysis shows embeddedness of conceptualization and systematic review shows utility to structure, and understand the concept of cultural adaptation.

\section{Search Strategy}
\label{app:AppendixSearchStrategy}

In our search we used an adapted version of the `SPIDER' research tool \citep[e.g.,][]{Cooke2012}. We utilized the \textit{Evaluation} element mainly to exclude articles that were not relevant to the search. The exact search terms used are listed in Table \ref{tab:SearchStrategiesTab}.
