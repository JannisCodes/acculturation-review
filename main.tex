% 150 word version
One of the key challenges to researching psychological acculturation is an immense heterogeneity in theories and measures. These inconsistencies make it difficult to compare past literature, hinder straight-forward measurement selections, and stifle theoretical integration. To structure acculturation, we propose to utilize the four basic aspects of human experiences (wanting, feeling, thinking, and doing) as a conceptual framework. We use this framework to build a theory-driven assessment of past theoretical (final \textit{N} = 92), \textcolor{blue}{psychometric} (final \textit{N} = 233) and empirical literature (final \textit{N} = 530). We find that the framework allows us to examine and compare past conceptualizations. For example, empirical works have understudied the more internal aspects of acculturation (i.e., motivations and feelings) compared to theoretical works. We, then, discuss the framework's novel insights including its temporal resolution, its comprehensive and cross-cultural structure and how the framework can aid transparent and functional theories, studies, and interventions going forward.

%One of the key challenges to researching psychological acculturation is an immense heterogeneity in theories and measures. These inconsistencies make it difficult to compare past literature on acculturation, hinder straight-forward measurement selections, and hamper the development of an overarching framework. To structure our understanding of the migration process, we propose to utilize the four basic aspects of human experiences (wanting, feeling, thinking, and doing) as a conceptual framework. We use this framework to build a theory-driven assessment of past theoretical (final \textit{N} = 92), methodological (final \textit{N} = 233) and empirical literature (final \textit{N} = 530). We find that the framework meaningfully structures past research. We, for example, find core differences between the theoretical and applied literature, where empirical works have understudied the more internal aspects of acculturation (motivations and feelings) and have often fallen short of capturing all four aspects of the migration experience. We also show that some publication fields include on fewer experience aspects and focus on different combinations of factors. We, then, discuss the framework's novel insights including its temporal resolution, its comprehensive and cross-cultural structure and how the framework can aid transparent and functional theories, studies, and interventions going forward.

\noindent\textbf{Public significance statement}: This systematic \textcolor{blue}{scoping} review indicates that the concept of psychological acculturation can be structured in terms of affect (e.g., feeling at home), behavior (e.g., language use), cognition (e.g., ethnic identification), and desire (e.g., independence wish). We find that the framework is useful in structuring past research and helps with new predictions and interventions. We, for example, find a crucial disconnect between theory and practice, which will need to be resolved in the future.

% Relevance
% Long discussed and relevant to society
The question of how people change when they get into continuous first-hand contact with other cultures is likely as old as the history of human migration. And thus migration adjustment remains an important issue for many societies around the world. 
Over the past 80 years, researchers of the psychological sciences have proposed hundreds of models and measurements for this phenomenon of "psychological acculturation" \citep[][]{Rudmin2003a}. Yet, despite enormous theoretical and empirical advances, it remains unclear what psychological acculturation exactly entails and a conceptual framework allowing for a synthesis of the past literature on psychological acculturation is still missing \citep{Birman2014c}.

% Problem - Illustration: Past Theory Use
We find an illustration of this challenging heterogeneity in the use of prominent theories of psychological acculturation. One prominent approach has been to conceptualize psychological acculturation as a two-dimensional set of orientations towards the heritage- and the dominant culture --- Berry's (\citeyear{Berry1980, Berry1997b, Berry2005}) now famous `acculturation orientations'. However, over the past 40 years, Berry himself has used a variety of attitudes (i.e., preferences) and behaviors (i.e., actual activities) to describe what these orientations should entail \citep{Berry2005}. And a broader review of the theory found that other researchers had conceptualized and measured `acculturation orientations' with even more diverse aspects. Conceptualizations had, for example, included attitudes, attachments, goals, identifications, or choices and uses of cultural elements \citep[e.g., language, food, or dresses. See,][]{Rudmin2003a}. We see a similar pattern with conceptualizations of psychological acculturation as a `psychological and socio-cultural adaptation' process. Here, cultural adaptation has, for example, included aspects such as life satisfaction and well-being, as well as cultural skills, and work performance \citep{Searle1990, Ward2001, Berry2003}.
Measurements of psychological acculturation are, thus, inconsistent across studies and it remains unclear what aspects the concept exactly entails, and how these aspects are organized.

% Problem - Consequences
% Theory and Application; Past and Future
This heterogeneity of aspects presents fundamental challenges to researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers in the field. Looking back at past theories and measures, different conceptualizations might lead to different results \citep{Snauwaert2003} and the diversities of included or excluded concepts makes it virtually impossible to compare different studies --- which makes it difficult to integrate them quantitatively or qualitatively \citep{Taft1981}.
And looking forward, it remains difficult to select acculturation elements and develop new theories and measurements. A coherent conceptual framework would be necessary to make informed and transparent choices on which aspects are (ir)relevant to a given research question and how they relate to one another.
Given these challenges, some have even suggested that psychological acculturation should not be measured until common terminologies and frameworks are available \citep{Escobar2000}.

% Aim - General
% Therefore we suggest a conceptual framework
We have, thus, developed a descriptive conceptual framework to analyze, measure, and understand the concept of psychological acculturation. In this paper we describe how this framework was developed based on work with practitioners in the field and recent developments within the literature. We then apply the framework in a systematic \textcolor{blue}{scoping} review of the literature to examine its utility and identify gaps within the literature. The proposed framework, thus, has a different objective than previous efforts which have catalogued literature on acculturation \citep[e.g.,][]{Castels2003}, built multidimensional measures of integration \citep[e.g.,][]{Harder2018}, normative frameworks \citep[e.g.,][]{Ager2008a}, or theories of acculturation \citep[e.g.,][]{Berry2005}. Rather than offering a new measurement, definition, or theory, we aim to build a framework to assess and compare these conceptual elements. 

% Aim - Specific
% We do this by using ABCD
To build a framework that would comprehensively structure the concept of psychological acculturation across a wide range of contexts, we propose to utilize the basic aspects of human experiences.
Building on discussions with experts in the field and past reviews, we propose that the psychological acculturation experience can be understood in terms of affects, behaviors, cognitions, and desires. Psychological acculturation in this framework might, for example, be understood or measured in terms of behavioral acculturation, such as language use, or voting; cognitive acculturation, such as ethnic identification, or cultural values endorsement; affective acculturation, such as feeling at home, or loneliness; motivational acculturation, such as the satisfaction of competence or independence needs; or as a combination of any or all of these aspects (also see \tblref{tab:AspectExamples} for a range of example concepts). 

\color{blue}
Such a framework, thus, explicitly aims to allow researchers and practitioners to review past acculturation literature based on the aspects considered. As a result, researchers can consider broader integration efforts and novel predictions of how acculturation processes develop psychologically. Moreover, the affect, behavior, cognition, desire separation allows researchers to make clearer and more transparent decisions of which aspects of acculturation are relevant to their research question and which aspects they measure. Similarly, practitioners can use the framework to make more informed decisions on which aspects are relevant for policy development and intervention design.

% Structure of Paper
In the following sections, we will develop this framework in more detail and will then apply it in a systematic \textcolor{blue}{scoping} review of the past theoretical, \textcolor{blue}{psychometric}, empirical literature on acculturation.

\input{Tables/AspectExmpl}

\section{Framework Development} 
This framework was developed based on collaborations with resettlement organizations and migrant citizens as well as based on past reviews and theoretical developments within the field. A focus group discussion with key societal stakeholders inspired this undertaking and laid the groundwork for the development of an experience framework of psychological acculturation \textcolor{blue}{(see Supplemental Material X for full methodological detail)}\footnote{For the focus group discussion we reached out to societal stakeholders of the acculturation process to gather information on key acculturation aspects in the lived realities out in the field. These experience reports formed the earliest foundation of our framework aspects. The focus group consisted of voluntary migrants, refugees, teachers, language- and integration coaches, volunteers and staff of a regional refugee resettlement agency as well as a representative of the local government. The 12 carefully selected and invited participants joined a 120 minutes round-table focus group discussion on the concept of acculturation. With informed consent by the participants, the discussion was audio recorded, transcribed, and later coded in three coding cycles of (1) initial In Vivo coding using the participants own words, (2) open coding inductively identifying common topics and elements, as well as (3) a content analysis using focused coding to summarize the overarching themes, which included the experience aspects discussed here.}. Yet, at the same time, the framework also grew out of a strong theoretical tradition in the field and arguably brings together many of the past advances in capturing psychological acculturation. We will first briefly address the notion of using a phenomenological approach for psychological acculturation and will then introduce each of the experience aspects before we apply the framework in a systematic literature review.

% Experience Structure
There is a converging theoretical consensus that human experiences can fundamentally be understood in terms of wanting, feeling, thinking, and doing \citep[sometimes referred to as the ABCs or ABCDs of psychology: affect, behavior, cognition, desire; e.g.,][]{Cottam2010, Hogg2005, Jhangiani2014}.\footnote{It should also be noted that ABC(D) frameworks have been used effectively to structure theories and models across a wide variety of fields --- including research on attitudes \citep{Breckler1984} and ambivalence \citep{VanHarreveld2015}, the self \citep{Cote2009} and self-regulation \citep{Ben-Eliyahu2015}, the big five personality traits \citep{Wilt2016}, suicidality \citep{Harris2015} and in clinical interventions \citep{Eifert1989}. Interestingly, the affect, behavior, and cognition structure has even found application in the development of human-like machines \citep{Guo2020}.} Following the premise that any human experience can be conceptualized within these four basic aspects, we believe that an ABCD framework of psychological acculturation could offer a comprehensive and theory-driven framework to structure and analyze the concept of psychological acculturation. Importantly, affect, behavior, cognition, and desire are ideally suited to structure the concept of psychological acculturation in particular, because all four aspects (1) are influenced by culture, (2) are relevant in the interactions between cultures, and (3) are fundamental to the concept of adaptation.

% Culture
% Definition: culture as external social expectations focused on our "manners of acting, thinking and feeling, which are invested with a coercive power by virtue of which they exercise control over him" \citep[][p. 52; on social facts]{Durkheim1982, Gilbert1989}.
Cultures are often defined as external social expectations focused on our "manners of acting, thinking and feeling, which are invested with a coercive power by virtue of which they exercise control over him" \citep[][p. 52; on social facts]{Durkheim1982, Gilbert1989}. In such an understanding, cultures, for example, define expected patterns of behavior (e.g., dress or communication styles), cognition (e.g., sense of race-, class-, gender-, and sexual identities), affects (e.g., expressions of emotions), and desires (e.g., virtues and duties)\footnote{For a discussion of culture and behavior see for example \citet[][]{Legare2019, Whiting1980}, for cognitions see for example \citet[][]{Gelfand2011, Nisbett2002}, for emotions see for example \citet[][]{Holodynski2012, Boiger2018}, and desires see for example \citet[][]{McInerney2016, Morling2017}.}. The study of affect, behavior, cognition, and desire is, thus, well-aligned with the experience of culture in acculturation.

% Interaction
Additionally, affect, behavior, cognition and desire are also closely related to inter-group and inter-cultural contacts --- which is an essential condition for acculturation to occur. How and why people get into behavioral contact with people from other backgrounds has, for example, been linked to group-specific needs, and desires, such as power and acceptance \citep[e.g.,][]{Hassler2021, Shnabel2008a}. Similarly, outcomes of these interactions are often governed by inter-group cognitions, such as perceptions of threat or shared identities \citep[e.g.,][]{Dovidio2017, Stephan2000a} and inter-group emotions, including pride, or anxiety \citep[e.g.,][]{Iyer2008, Stephan1992}. Affect, behavior, cognition, and desire are, thus, also at the very heart of contacts between cultural groups.

% Adaptation
And lastly, affect, behavior, cognition, and desire have all been highlighted in the conceptualization of human functioning and adaptation --- a core outcome for many acculturation researchers \citep[e.g., see][]{Berry2006a,Searle1990,Ward2001,Maertz2016}. Adaptation in such an understanding can include, behavioral adaptions, such as building skills and competences \citep[e.g.,][]{Bevan1965}, cognitive adaptation, including self-image restorations and dissonance reductions \citep[e.g.,][]{Czajkowska2017}, affective adaptions, such as dealing with feelings of culture shock and homesickness \citep[e.g.,][]{Smith1990, VanTilburg1996}, as well as desire adaptations, such as regulations of status and affection needs \citep[e.g.,][]{Steverink2006}. In sum, affects, behaviors, cognitions, and desires not only form the fundamental aspects of human experiences but also have a deep connection to culture, cultural contacts, and psychological adaptation --- which are essential to the idea and definition of psychological acculturation.

% ABC in Theoretical Traditions
Interestingly, the ABC structure is not entirely foreign to the field of acculturation. Ward and colleagues \citep{Ward2001, Masgoret2006, Ward2019} have previously pointed out that theoretical perspectives on acculturation tend to focus on affect, behavior, or cognition. Within the affective tradition Ward situates the stress and coping literature, behavioral traditions are the cultural learning theories, and social identification theories form the cognitive theories. \citet{Sam2006b} has even noted that such a perspective might be useful in structuring the core components of psychological acculturation. 
Following Sam's (\citeyear{Sam2006b}) suggestion, we propose that, once we include desires (i.e., motivational literature), we can build a generalized conceptual framework. That is to say, that an expanded ABCD structure would not only summarize theoretical traditions but would offer a universal and theory-based framework to the concept of psychological acculturation because it comprehensively structures the concept based on the fundamental aspects of the human experience. Such a framework should structure psychological acculturation at any level of abstraction (from the most abstract theory level to the most applied operationalization level).

In the next sections we will discuss how each of the aspects emerged out of the focus group discussion as well as conceptual developments within the field. 

\subsection{Behavior}
% Focus Group Discussion
Behaviors --- that is actions and mannerisms --- were one of the major themes within the focus group discussion because they were perceived as particularly visible and subjected to clear expectations by the dominant group. The discussants especially focused on social behaviors (such as language learning and contacts outside the home) as interactive and reciprocal elements of psychological acculturation because they enable connections to the culture and being an active member of society.

\begin{displayquote}
    Maria:\\
    {[...]} \textit{while, of course, you integrate best when you go to work.}
    
    Moderator:\\
    \textit{Why is that exactly?}
    
    Maria:\\
    {[...]} \textit{Because there you have daily contacts with locals.}
\end{displayquote}

% Past literature
Given the overt nature of behaviors and their interconnectedness with culture, behaviors have also been a prominent aspect of the acculturation literature. Ward and colleagues (\citeyear{Ward2019}) in their review have identified cultural learning theories as one key literature tradition that has focused on behavioral aspects of acculturation. They relate these learning theories to the acquisition of effective skills and competences as the behavioral operationalizations \citep[including, verbal and non-verbal communication skills][]{Ward2001}. Other examples of behavioral conceptualizations of acculturation (beyond Ward's focus), include civic participation \citep[e.g., voting;][]{Lessard-Phillips2020}, inter-ethnic marriage \citep[e.g.,][]{Song2009}, and media consumption \citep[e.g.,][]{Shoemaker1985}. 

\subsection{Cognition}
\begin{displayquote}
    Yahya:\\
    {[...]} \textit{Once I started my education, I felt part of society.} {[...]} \textit{That was not the case when I was learning Dutch at the university, at the language school, or at other places before. Only later when I was at school, ... I feel: Okay, now I feel I am really in the Netherlands.}
    
    Joop:\\
    \textit{Why did you not have that at the language school?}
    
    Yahya:\\
    \textit{Because I was only a refugee.}
\end{displayquote}

% Focus group discussion
Cognitive aspects, which commonly entail the thinking processes of the human experience, were also highlighted in the focus group discussion because they pertain to many navigational issues in society. Language-, social- and communication norms and learning about more formal social systems, values, and social rules were examples of how cognitive changes related to bridging social gaps. A second major topic discussed was the role of identity development. The newcomers pointed to both a break in identity (the struggle of defining oneself in the new environment) as well as the struggle of dealing with a singular (migrant or refugee) identity label and the process of developing a more complex identity narrative towards others.

% Past literature
Given the pertinent connection between cultures and cognitive processes, it might come as little surprise that cognitions have also played a major role in the acculturation literature. Within the cognitive tradition, Ward and colleagues (\citeyear{Ward2001, Ward2019}) have identified ethnic identity and group perception theories, with a particular focus on Berry's (\citeyear{Berry1997b}) acculturation attitudes. Beyond the theories identified by Ward, the acculturation literature has recently also focused on several other cognitive conceptualizations of psychological acculturation, including cultural values \citep[e.g.,][]{Marin2003} and stereotypes \citep[e.g.,][]{Stanciu2018}. 

\subsection{Affect}
\begin{displayquote}
    Fariq:\\
    {[...]} \textit{But for me the language is very very difficult. And then you think people are not open. And you don't understand because your language isn't that good. And then I maybe don't feel welcomed when I have questions or want to approach them.}
\end{displayquote}

Affect --- the human capacity to feel \citep[including emotions and moods;][]{FeldmanBarrett2007} --- was a prominent theme in the focus group discussion because it foregrounded the importance of the subjective experience as acculturation. Instead of focusing on purely behavioral outcome conceptualizations (e.g., housing, job, education), the group highlighted the importance of considering the affective acculturation experience (e.g., feeling at home, feeling accepted). As an example, when asked why having a job is important to acculturation, newcomers and supporters pointed to a feeling of usefulness and being part of society. 

% Past literature
But affect and emotion have also been discussed within the psychological acculturation literature. \citet{Ward2001} in her review of the acculturation traditions, describes the stress and coping literature --- especially Berry's concept of acculturation stress \citep{Berry1997b} --- as the affect component of acculturation. In this tradition, the main constructs that constitute the affective dimension are the psychological and emotional well-being as part of the psychological adaptation process \citep[including, for example, life satisfaction and depression;][]{Ward2019}. However, beyond the theoretical stress literature tradition, there are also more immediate models and measurements of emotional acculturation. There is, for example, a relatively young tradition of 'emotional acculturation' as a distinct concept in which acculturation is understood as the similarity in emotional patterns \citep[see][for a review]{DeLeersnyder2017}. But also individual emotions, such as 'feeling accepted' \citep{Jasini2018}, or 'pride' \citep{Suinn1995} have received attention as discrete conceptualizations of acculturation. 

\subsection{Desire}
\begin{displayquote}
    Yahya:\\
    {[...]} \textit{Yes, they [parents] have control like a boss or a god. And I still had that in Syria but it kind of stopped, ... because I am not gonna be a kind of a slave to my family, ... because I want freedom for myself.}
\end{displayquote}

% Focus group discussion
Desires --- the motivational forces of the human experience --- were likely discussed most interestingly during the focus group discussion. The (lack of) motivation to interact with the new culture and its members was one key discussion point but motives for actions and psychological needs of the migrants were also discussed as more impalpable properties of other acculturation aspects (e.g., the need for acceptance during interactions). Yet, importantly the motivational aspect also highlighted the functional essence of individual acculturation. The needs for interactions, to be understood, for purpose, and for identity continuity were discussed as not necessarily expected by the dominant group but as intrinsic and fundamental to the health and functioning of the newcomers during the acculturation process.

% Past literature
Yet, despite these deep connections, few of the past reviews have examined motivation as a distinct aspect of psychological acculturation within the literature or the concept. However, outside of reviews, needs and wants have been discussed more frequently as a conceptual aspect of psychological acculturation. For example, more and more researchers are looking at the motivations for migration in understanding acculturation \citep{Sandu2018, Echterhoff2020}. Additionally, motivations are more frequently considered as underlying  acculturation orientations \citep{Recker2017a}, acculturation behavior \citep{Reece2000}, and psychological adaptation \citep{Safdar2003}. 

\subsection{\textcolor{blue}{Aspect Distinctiveness and} the Lived Acculturation Experience}
% Experience aspects and lived experience
While we have introduced the four experience aspects as distinct elements, it is important to note that both in theory and in practice affect, behavior, cognition, and desire are not experienced as distinct entities. This was highlighted during the focus group discussion but is also reflected in theories on the aspects. As an example, most affects have a cognitive component just as most cognitions have an affective value. Similarly, motivation is commonly conceived as having both emotional (e.g., desire) and cognitive (e.g., goals) aspects, both of which are often directed towards behaviors (i.e., conation). Muddying the waters further is the difficulty that many operationalizations (and empirical measures) of psychological acculturation also include multiple aspects. Concepts such as satisfaction or distress, which are common measures of acculturation, famously include affective and cognitive components. Yet, despite the interdependence of aspects in theories and lived experience, the four aspects can consistently be identified within experiences and concepts --- they remain qualitatively different aspects of the experience. And as such, they offer a pragmatic lens to structure the psychological acculturation concept \citep{Kuhn1962}. Differentiating the four (needing, feeling, thinking, doing) qualities of an experience in what we consider psychological acculturation to be, allows us to structure our discussions of past, current, and future theories and measures of psychological acculturation.

% Past literature
%% Dynamic process rather than static end-product: 
% Experience can answer this call because it can only be understood based on past experiences
A final, fundamental property we would like to address in the experience framework is the understanding of psychological acculturation as a dynamic process rather than a static end-product. That psychological acculturation is a process, and that ``acculturation occurs when two independent cultural groups come into \textit{continuous first-hand contact over an extended period of time}'' \citep[][186]{Berry1989} seem to be a generally accepted assumption within the field \citep[e.g.,][]{Ward2016}. Yet, some reviews have pointed out that few empirical studies have actually considered the theoretical implications of migration as a process and even fewer have methodologically followed the trajectories of migrants over time \citep[][]{Brown2011, Ward2019}. We believe that the experience framework of psychological acculturation, as it is presented here, is ideally suited to deal with this conceptualization as a process. Philosophers of the phenomenological tradition have long highlighted that a subjective experience can only be understood within the history of past experiences \citep[e.g.,][]{Heidegger1978}. The human experiences are thus scalable and can capture processes of seconds or years and might even relate to generational or future conceptualizations.

In sum, the conceptual framework we propose suggests that the concept of psychological acculturation is psychologically fundamentally structured into affect, behavior, cognition, and desire aspects. And while each experiential aspect captured part of the concept, only jointly will they comprehensively capture the full psychological acculturation concept. We have also shown that the four experience aspects are all highly relevant to the concept as they capture cultures, cross-cultural contact, and adaptation. The framework can thus find utility in comparing past literature and interventions (e.g., which conceptual aspects were considered for particularly important findings), can structure future study and intervention designs (e.g., which aspects are relevant to health behaviors), and can advance future theoretical developments (e.g., which experiential aspect organizes the other acculturation aspects for specific outcomes). In the following, we will take first steps at exploring the applied utility of the framework, using the past literature on psychological acculturation.

\section{The Present Study}

%\begin{center}
%    \Warning\ \textsc{next sections not re-worked yet} \Warning
%\end{center}

The aim of our empirical efforts presented here is to put our proposed framework to the test. We have lamented that one of the challenges of a heterogeneous field is that it is difficult to assess and compare past literature. As a framework, we have suggested that the psychological aspects of experiences could comprehensively structure our assessment of the literature. We will thus systematically retrieve the past literature on psychological acculturation \textcolor{blue}{of first-generation migrants. We chose first-generation migrants specifically to allow for a focused systematic literature search while still maintaining the broad heterogeneity of acculturation experiences. For all relevant works we} will extract which experiential aspects were considered in the research. We expect that these efforts will provide insights into the perceived importance of desires, affects, cognitions, and behaviors for psychological acculturation. We also expect that this allows us to assess how many experience aspects are usually considered and which aspects are considered jointly. And finally, we aim to compare the understanding of psychological acculturation across different fields to assess the comparative utility. 

To apply the framework, we specifically target three bodies of literature that capture the concept of psychological acculturation. Firstly, we will assess the theoretical literature on psychological acculturation. The theoretical literature should offer the broadest, most abstract, and most comprehensive works on psychological acculturation. A coding of the aspects considered in these theories should, thus, offer insights into the assumptions on which researchers build their empirical work.
Secondly, we will assess methodological literature developing acculturation measures. As operationalizations of the concept within the empirical literature, validated scales usually focus on a concept in a generalized manner, rather than focusing on aspects only relevant to a specific `applied' investigation. Coding psychological acculturation measures separately might also aid future considerations of measure selection because we effectively build a database of scales that can be filtered by whether the scale includes measurements of affects, behaviors, cognitions, and desires (see Supplemental Material D). 
Thirdly and finally, once we have considered the validated scales in particular, we will more generally assess the empirical literature that used measures of psychological acculturation. Capturing operationalizations within empirical studies, allows us to investigate the focus within the empirical literature more broadly and allows us to compare differences between fields and research subjects.

\color{blue}
In short, the main aims of our empirical efforts can be summarized in four main research questions.
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,label=RQ \arabic*:,leftmargin=1.8cm]
    \item How have psychological acculturation experiences been conceptualized within the past literature?
    \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,label=(RQ 1\alph*):,leftmargin=1.64cm]
        \item What is the relative importance of each of the affect, behavior, cognition, desire aspects within past conceptualizations?
        \item Which experience aspects are considered jointly in the conceptualization of psychological acculturation?
        \item Which conceptualizations of psychological acculturation cannot be captured with the ABCD framework?
    \end{enumerate}
    \item What are the main differences in the conceptualizations of psychological acculturation experiences across the past theoretical, methodological, and empirical literature?
    \item How do conceptualizations of psychological acculturation differ in terms of affect, behavior, cognition, and desire aspects across different publication fields?
    \item How is the cultural, individual, and situation context of psychological acculturation conceptualized and addressed in the past literature? [see Supplemental Information C]
\end{enumerate}

To address these research questions we, specifically chose a \textit{systematic scoping review}. Such a review is \textit{systematic} because it uses ``systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant research, and to collect and analyze data from the studies" \citep[PRISMA guidelines; ][p. 1]{Moher2009}. In practice, this meant that we developed systematic a literature search and data extraction protocols for a structured, transparent, and reproducible review (for the systematic search protocol see \appref{app:AppendixSearchStrategy} and for our coding manual see Supplemental Material A; also see \citealp{Peters2015}). To analyze and summarize the data we then perform a \textit{scoping analysis} to ``map the key concepts underpinning a research area and the main sources and types of evidence available" \citep[][p.21]{Arksey2005}. In our case, this meant that we were able to address our broader research questions of how psychological acculturation has been conceptualized within different bodies of past literature and how useful the ABCD separation was in assessing and comparing conceptualizations.

\color{black}
It should also be noted that we consciously chose not to conduct a meta-analysis. We conduct this review exactly because we are worried about comparability across studies, a key requirement of meta-analyses \citep{Pogue1998}. In our case, we, arguably, do not have a clearly defined concept and exclusions to ensure a cohesive data set would be counterproductive to our efforts. Moreover, a meta-analysis is commonly understood as an analysis of analyses \citep{Glass1976}. However, since we are interested in a conceptualization (rather than a relationship, a scale metric, or population parameter) a quantitative summary in form of a meta-analysis is not well-suited to answer our research question. Also a meta-analysis of our own extracted data seems profitless because it would likely mirror a sample size weighted average.

In the following section, we will briefly discuss how we conducted the systematic \textcolor{blue}{scoping} review and will sequentially analyze the role of experience aspects in the theoretical, methodological, and empirical literature of psychological psychological acculturation. \textcolor{blue}{Please note that all protocols, materials, data, and software code is openly accessible as part of our OSF repository \citep[][]{Kreienkamp2021e}.}

\section{Discussion}
% Recap: Problem, Aim, Proposal
% Problem:
An enormous variety of aspects of our lives are affected by cultures, the psychological changes we experience when we get into continuous first-hand contact with another culture (i.e., psychological acculturation) are consequently equally plentiful and diverse.
% Aim:
In order to make sense of past theories and measures of psychological acculturation and to develop new theories and measures, it is thus necessary to build a conceptual framework that allows us to analyze, compare, and understand the individual aspects of psychological acculturation.
% Proposal:
In this paper, we have proposed that taking the fundamental aspects of the human experience (affect, behavior, cognition, and desire) would offer a comprehensive and theory-based structure to the psychological acculturation concept (in both theory and application). 

% Focus Group Discussion:
Our investigation has utilized a variety of empirical sources and applications that offer support for the applicability of an experience framework in the acculturation field. Firstly, the ABCD experience framework is, in part, based on a qualitative investigation, where key societal stakeholders have distinguished behavior, cognition, affect, and desire as important aspect of acculturation. The discussants highlighted that behavioral and cognitive aspects have more expectations from host population and are more visible, but affect and desire are equally important and often form powerful motors of change. The discussion of psychological acculturation in the field has thus offered a strong bottom-up source for the validity of the framework and the importance of all four aspects.

% Literature Review:
% Scales, Empirical, Theories
And secondly, we also applied the experience-based framework in a systematic \textcolor{blue}{scoping} review of past theoretical, methodological, and empirical literature on psychological acculturation.
\color{blue}
We found that the framework was able to capture a heterogeneous set of theoretical, psychometric, and empirical works. We were able to assess and bring together a broad set of theoretical works and were able to compare conceptualizations between publication fields and across different types of literature. We particularly found that theoretical conceptualizations of psychological acculturation tended to include more ABCD aspects than the psychometric and empirical works, and across all three types of literature researchers have tended to focus on the more external behaviors and cognitions while the more internal affects and desires have remained understudied, especially in applied empirical works.
\color{black}
    
From our framework development and systematic \textcolor{blue}{scoping} review, we thus offer several novel insights, which address past conceptual issues.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Our framework highlights that psychological acculturation is based on separate experiences of contact over time. This emphasises the episodic nature of acculturation, where a majority of the psychological changes are driven by contact events. In most cases, past experiences collectively generate the present contact experience \citep[also see][]{Husserl1959, Heidegger1978}. There is thus usually a clear aggregating `temporality' to human experiences (although experiences can focus on the past, present, and even the future). We see this in the systematic \textcolor{blue}{scoping} review, where \textcolor{blue}{an episodic and contact-focused condition-response-outcome separation was able to organize the past theoretical literature. Additionally,} the framework was able to capture cross-sectional as well as longitudinal studies and was relevant with samples prior and post the migration event (including, prospective migrants). 

\item Because affect, behavior, cognition, and desire broadly capture the human experience \textcolor{blue}{\citep[e.g.,][]{Jhangiani2014}}, the experience framework comprehensively captures the psychological aspects of acculturation. The framework, thus, captures a broad and complex phenomenon while still offering a clear and theory-driven structure of the concept and its applications. This meant that in our systematic \textcolor{blue}{scoping} review application very few studies did not capture any experience aspect \textcolor{blue}{(e.g., length of residency, or migration status; also see \tblref{tab:ExclusionsCombined})} and we were arguably able to make meaningful comparison across a wide variety of contexts and even fields.

\item The experience aspects of psychological acculturation are culturally universal. The experience approach is based on basic human faculties, where generally speaking every healthy person has the capacity for feelings, thoughts, desires, and behaviors. Focusing on fundamental faculties relevant to any conscious person makes the framework widely applicable across cultural contexts. ABCD frameworks have, for example, been found across cultures \citep[e.g.,][]{Bhawuk2011}\footnote{It is important to note that while anyone will have motives, emotions, thoughts, and behaviors, what one needs (e.g., belongingness or independence), feels (e.g., sadness or happiness), thinks (e.g., identification or disinterest), or does (e.g., studying or working) is highly ideographic. It is this ideographic content that makes the framework relevant to such a broad range of migration contexts. Yet, it is the content-free structure --- the presence or absence of the basic aspects in conceptualizations of acculturation --- that is transferable across contexts and studies, enabling comparisons and broader conceptual discussion. It should also be noted that in our opinion such a framework does not stand in conflict with cultural or indigenous psychological concerns of an absolutist, or deterministic psychology \citep[e.g.,][]{Kim2006a}. In fact, cultural psychologists, together with many decolonial researchers, have long argued that the individual embedded and lived experience should gain a more central role in our theoretical developments \citep[e.g., ontological turn;][]{Pedersen2020}.}. It is thus not surprising that we were able to identify ABCD aspects in acculturation research from more than 40 cultural contexts (see Supplementary Information C).

\item We explain psychological acculturation as a complex phenomenon. Most theoretical works we collected as part of the systematic \textcolor{blue}{scoping} review conceptualize psychological acculturation as a composite phenomenon that includes multiple aspects of the human experience (affect, behavior, cognition, and desire). This stands in stark contrast to singular research traditions and many empirical operationalizations that have intentionally or unintentionally focused on a single aspect of the psychological acculturation experience \citep[also see][]{Ward2001}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{New Research Directions}
From both the development of the experience framework of psychological acculturation and its application in the systematic \textcolor{blue}{scoping} review, we can thus formulate a number of lessons learned that could guide future work in the field (also see \tblref{tab:SummaryTbl}). We believe that these have a number of broader implications for researchers and practitioners.
For advancing future research projects, the systematic \textcolor{blue}{scoping} review and the conceptual framework can offer future perspectives for (1) the clarity of conceptualizations, (2) the focus of study or intervention, (3) future empirical tests, and (4) new theoretical predictions. 

% Transfer-ability and comparability: 
% - Additionally, we observed a number of transparency and clarity issues during our systematic scoping review: focus of aspect, operationalization (e.g., items or clear descriptions)
% - Lastly, potential data issues: broad category of migrants considered (e.g., Asian, Spanish-speaking), use of ad-hoc and non-validated scales, focus on clinical outcomes with non-clinical samples.
\paragraph{On transfer-ability and comparability.} Our systematic \textcolor{blue}{scoping} review highlighted a number of transparency- and transferability issues within the field. In some works the conceptualization and operationalizations of acculturation remained vague and unexplained \textcolor{blue}{(for more information on this issue see Supplemental Materials B and C)}. Future research should clearly define which experience aspect is focused on and why a particular aspect is (ir)relevant to a specific project. Also more broadly, future research should assess the impact and transfer-ability of sample and measurement decisions, such as recruiting broad categories of migrants (e.g., "Asian", "Spanish-speaking"), the use of ad-hoc and non-validated scales, or the focus on clinical outcomes with non-clinical samples --- all of which were common within the empirical literature.


% Empirical studies:
% - re-iterate the importance of process focus (disconnect theory and empirical)
% - test theories in complexity (disconnect theory and empirical)
% - empirical studies need to investigate affect and desire are needed (highlighted in theories and focus group)
\paragraph{On testing current theories.} We find that theoretical works commonly focus on acculturation as a process that includes multiple experience aspects, while empirical works were considerably more static and narrow in their conceptualization. This gap means that many theoretical models remain empirically untested and many empirical test are not accurately embedded within theories. Future research should, thus, consider more longitudinal and multi-faceted conceptualizations of acculturation to meaningfully test theoretical models and -predictions in their entirety.

A similar gap exists in the focus on specific aspects, where affect and desire conceptualizations are highlighted in theoretical works as well as our qualitative study but remain relatively absent in empirical works. Future empirical studies will thus need to investigate the mechanisms and roles of affective and motivational acculturation.

% Relationships:
% - need to investigate the relationships between different experience aspects. 
% - need to investigate the relationships of experience aspects with other concepts.
\paragraph{On novel theoretical predictions.} Finally, our framework also opens up the possibility to investigate relationships between individual experience aspects of acculturation and of these aspects with other concepts. Future research could, for example, assess whether a certain aspect precedes another or how one aspect might feed back into another. There are plenty (social) psychological theories that speak to the organization of human experiences and offer meaningful predictions of causal pathways for functional elements. For example, when focusing on acculturation behaviors one prediction model might argue that in response to a given interaction situation, cognitions regulate affect and desire to produce adaptive behaviors (cf., cognitive self-regulation theories; \citealp{Panadero2017}; for illustration see \fgrref[A]{fig:NovelModels}). However, a conflicting model might propose that motivations organize cognition and affect, which in turn drive behavior (cf., theory of reasoned goal pursuit; \citealp{Ajzen2019}; also see \fgrref[B]{fig:NovelModels}). It is thus up to future studies to determine which experience aspect causally drives acculturation behaviors. And similar endeavors could help explain emotional, motivational, or cognitive acculturation outcomes. Similarly, the subdivision into experience aspects also allows for more nuanced investigations of these acculturation aspects to other concepts (e.g., does behavioral acculturation have the same impact on health as emotional acculturation?). 
\color{blue}
It is important to note here that distinguishing the four aspects should not reduce the complexity of human experiences. While researchers and lay people are generally able to identify affect, behaviors, cognitions, and desires as distinct aspects of the psychological acculturation, it remains important to consider that they often co-occur in psychological concepts and experiences.
\color{black}

% Extended Model as theoretical integration
More broadly, the framework also integrates many of the prominent models and theories within the acculturation literature (see \fgrref{fig:ModelContext}). The distinction of affect, behavior, cognition, and desire on an individual and cultural level (i.e., personal vs. expected ABCDs) are consistent with the generalized frameworks \citep[e.g.,][]{Berry2005, Cross1991} and ecological process models within the field \citep[e.g.,][]{Ward2016, Serdarevic2005, Mistry2010}. And by differentiating expected ABCDs prior to contact (i.e., acculturation conditions) from experiences ABCDs during contact (i.e., acculturation response) and after the contact (acculturation outcome) the different temporal stages of an episodic contact experience extend and streamline traditional orientation-outcome models \citep[e.g.,][]{Arends-Toth2006a, TeLindert2008a}. In such a process approach cultural conflict models can additionally address conditions of change \citep[e.g.,][]{Robinson2019} and stress adaptation models can further discern conditions of stress \citep[e.g.,][]{Kim1988, Hajro2019, Sam2006b} between the experience steps. In its structure and approach the framework is also consistent with liminality- \citep[e.g.,][]{Loon2021, Baird2015}, and structuralist approaches \citep[e.g.,][]{Kemppainen2020}.

In its application the framework might then address the difficulty of quantitative integration --- for example, through meta-analytic reviews. The ABCD experience framework offers both a filter- as well as a moderator solution for new quantitative integration efforts. For specific relationships (e.g., between psychological acculturation and health-seeking behaviors) quantitative reviewers may choose to only select a specific set of experience aspects (e.g., only behavioral acculturation) and if multiple aspects are considered the ABCD structure offers a meaningful moderator variable. 

\subsection{Practical Implications}
Our framework also offers guidance to practitioners, policy makers, and acculturating individuals. 

%% Use of the framework:
\paragraph{Facilitating intervention focus.} The framework might be of interest to practitioners and policy-makers because it is theory-based and brings together a wide range of past literature. The structured approach might be useful in making clear and informed decisions while still considering the concept in its personal complexity. When considering psychological acculturation practitioners can choose to assess or address emotions and moods (affective acculturation), behaviors and mannerisms (behavioral acculturation), thoughts and cognitions (cognitive acculturation) or needs and desires (motivational acculturation). Whichever selection is made for an application, the framework offers a concise decision making tool and the review suggests that most theories of acculturation call for a large number of aspects.

\paragraph{Giving agency to the target group.} The experience conceptualization of psychological acculturation is inherently a bottom-up approach to the topic. Taking migration experiences as the starting point highlights the considerations for the lived realities of the researched individuals and communities. Scholars in the traditions of critical research methods have long highlighted the importance of including the participants in the research conceptualization process \citep[e.g.,][]{Kovach2009}. If one uses the experiences of the researched individuals to guide the study or intervention design, one inevitably emphasizes the agency and needs of the community --- lending relevance and ownership of knowledge to the community \citep[e.g., ][]{Schmidt2021}. Using the individual experience as our conceptual foundation reminds us that in clinical and social protection contexts the recipients are human beings with complex experiences. In its application, the four experience aspects thus offer a structure for building humane interventions as well as monitoring and evaluations efforts of such interventions. 

\paragraph{Comprehensive considerations.} Our framework itself, the underlying focus group discussion, as well as the systematic \textcolor{blue}{scoping} review of the theoretical literature suggests that psychological acculturation is best captured with all four experience aspects of acculturation (i.e., wanting, feeling, thinking, and doing). Efforts that aim to monitor, or address maladaptive acculturation should thus consider the entire broad acculturation experience. Resettlement organizations aiding new migrants may, for example, want to monitor cognitive and behavioral acculturation (e.g, cultural knowledge, or contact behaviors) but should equally consider motivational or emotional acculturation (e.g., unfulfilled competence needs, or feelings of loneliness).

\label{fig:NovelModels}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Limitations and Reflexivity}
Yet, as with any large-scale conceptual undertaking, the framework and this review study are not without limitations. Notably, the framework exclusively focuses on the psychological acculturation process. This has been the explicit focus of our efforts but this also means that non-psychological aspects such as biological, cultural, or societal changes are not captured directly but only to the extent to which they impact the experiences of the involved people. Future work might want to integrate these different levels of group and individual, body and mind \citep[e.g.,][]{Eronen2021}. 

Another point that we have thus far mostly disregarded is the role of the migration context. While we have argued that the framework structure (i.e., the four experience aspects) is relevant across any context, the lived experiences are often fundamentally influenced by their context and environment. Three major contextual factors often found within the literature are the cultures of the dominant and non-dominant groups, the interacting individuals, and the interaction situation or life domain. All of these contextual elements will likely have a profound impact on the experience of affects, behaviors, cognitions, and desires. Cultural differences, such as laws or norms, individual differences, such as personality or age, but also situational differences in how public or private the acculturation experience is are all likely intermingled with the individual experience aspects. This means that especially within more applied research projects such contextual considerations will be meaningful predictors of individual and group differences (for a first discussion of these contextual factors within our systematic \textcolor{blue}{scoping} review, see Supplemental Material C). 

Next to the more formal limitations of scope and methodology, we would like to
\color{blue}
reflect on some of our more idiosyncratic research approach choices. One is our focus on the migrant minority perspective in understanding the psychological mechanisms of acculturation. The framework was developed as part of a university-NGO collaboration with a local refugee resettlement organization and the joint focus group discussion formed a cornerstone of this framework (also see Supplemental Information X). While we belief that the ABCD framework should equally apply to a dominant group perspective, our systematic scoping review has explicitly excluded any research from a dominant group perspective (see \tblref{tab:ExclusionsCombined}, ``not migrant"; for more detail see exclusion reasons in Supplemental Information A). Thus, future efforts might validate whether the ABCD framework applies to the acculturation responses of the dominant group in a similar manner.

A second issue of reflexivity is our empiricist approach in validating the ABCD framework. In particular, we chose to conduct a systematic scoping review of the past literature on acculturation to apply the framework. While we have also discussed the results with our societal partners and have shared an internal policy brief, our empirical efforts here have not explicitly addressed responses of practitioners, policy makers, and migrant residents. We have laid out above where we see practical applications of the framework and how the framework can be used by both researchers and practitioners, yet full validation of the framework for individual studies and interventions is still advisable and larger policy briefs might still be needed for full practical validation. Please note that as part of our transparency efforts, we offer a full reflexivity- and positionality discussion in Supplementary Information Y.
\color{black}

\subsection{Conclusions}
\color{blue}
Based on bottom-up work with expert practitioners and by building on recent developments within the field, we suggest a psychological acculturation framework utilizing the affect-behavior-cognition-desire aspects of human experiences. We showcase the structuring and comparative utility by applying the framework in a systematic scoping review of the past theoretical, methodological, and empirical literature. We find that the framework is able to comprehensively structure past works (e.g., few articles did not fit the ABCD conceptualization), identify gaps within the literature (e.g., crucial disconnect between theory and empirical practice), and is able to assist in future theoretical and applied conceptualizations (e.g., novel predictions and interventions). As such, the framework provides a robust starting point and a useful tool for both researchers and practitioners.

\section{Search Strategy}
\label{app:AppendixSearchStrategy}

To assess the past empirical and theoretical literature on psychological acculturation, we performed a systematic literature review. We first read seminal and review works within the field \citep[including,][]{Ward2019, Berry1997b, Berry2003, Szapocznik1978, Sam2006a, Rudmin2003a}. Based on our reading of the literature, we designed a comprehensive literature search strategy in an iterative fashion. 

For the empirical work on acculturation, we performed a literature search on March 4\textsuperscript{th}, 2020 and February 14\textsuperscript{th}, 2021, within the ``APA PsycINFO'' bibliographic databases using the EBSCO\textit{host} provider. The databases also included the PsycARTICLES, PsycBOOKS, and PsycCRITIQUES databases as well ProQuest Dissertations with psychological relevance. The second literature search included alternate terms used less frequently to describe what we mean with psychological acculturation, including "transculturation" and "cultural transition". Additionally, the second search removed limiter terms that could have exclude interdisciplinary investigations and focused on human participants.

For the theoretical literature performed an additional, more specific, search of the same databases as well as the Web of Science Core Collection using the Clarivate Analytics provider on March 3\textsuperscript{rd}, 2021.

In designing our search strategy we used an adapted version of the `SPIDER' research tool \citep[e.g.,][]{Cooke2012}. We utilized the \textit{Evaluation} element mainly to exclude articles that were not relevant to the search. The exact search terms used are listed in \tblref{tab:SearchStrategiesTab} below.
