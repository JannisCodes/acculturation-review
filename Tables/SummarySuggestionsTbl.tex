Critical issues identified during systematic review &
Perspective / Suggestions \\ 
\hline

\vspace{-0.5em} The four experience aspects comprehensively structure psychological acculturation across a range of contexts & 
\vspace{-0.5em} Focus more on ABCD to structure our understanding of psychological acculturation                     \\ 

\vspace{-0.5em} Theories longitudinal but studies cross-sectional & 
\vspace{-0.5em} Focus more on longitudinal data assessments (congruency between theory–method–application)            \\ 

\vspace{-0.5em} Theories complex but studies few aspects & 
\vspace{-0.5em} Focus more on complex data assessments (congruency between theory–method–application)                 \\ 

\vspace{-0.5em} Little empirical focus on emotional and motivational changes (even though important in theories and qualitative) & 
\vspace{-0.5em} Focus more on internal aspects of affect and desire (close the gap)                                   \\ 

\vspace{-0.5em} Acculturation conceptualization often not explained & 
\vspace{-0.5em} transparency in focus: what is relevant to my question (research, or intervention)                    \\ 

\vspace{-0.5em} Acculturation operationalization often not explained (and sometimes not available) & 
\vspace{-0.5em} Transparency in measurement (or at least be very transparent in what is being measured).              \\ 

\vspace{-0.5em} Aspects are commonly mentioned independently & 
\vspace{-0.5em} Relationships between aspects                                                                         \\ 

\vspace{-0.5em} Theories have been used with focus on different aspects & 
\vspace{-0.5em} Structural theories (e.g., two dimensional acculturation orientations): Differences between aspects?  \\ 

\vspace{-0.5em} Adaptation defined inconsistently & 
\vspace{-0.5em} Functionality and adaptation per aspect                                                               \\ 

\vspace{-0.5em} Untransparent whether acculturation is in service of dominant or non-dominant group & 
\vspace{-0.5em} Start from bottom-up approach (if interested migrant); maybe move to conceptualization point          \\ 

\vspace{-0.5em} Target group often very broad (any migrant, Asia, Spanish-speaking, third world) & 
\vspace{-0.5em} Make certain that research question is transferable across cultural contexts and group specific       \\ 

\vspace{-0.5em} Scale validations in few cultural contexts but application in many cultural contexts & 
\vspace{-0.5em} Is this a scale or a theory problem? Should be checked.                                               \\ 

\vspace{-0.5em} much focus on clinical outcomes with few clinical samples & 
\vspace{-0.5em} probably drop this                                                                                    \\ 

\vspace{-0.5em} few applied studies use validated scales (problems of scales or applied studies?) & 
\vspace{-0.5em} Is this a problem? Should be checked.                                                                 \\ 

\vspace{-0.5em} Lots of theories & 
\vspace{-0.5em} Theoretical synthesis needed?                                                                         \\
