\purpose{
	This protocol document lays out detailed information for coders of the (included) manuscripts. This document serves as an instructive manual to the coders and documents the operationalizations of the coded variables. The systematic review produced three literature databases that aim to capture the status quo of the (1) theoretical, (2) methodological, and (3) empirical literature on psychological acculturation. The coding procedures (i.e., data extraction) for each dataset are documented in the following document protocol.

\step{domainPaper}{Focus concept of the manuscript.}{Data Collection}
\textit{Please specify the main focus of the manuscript. The focus is often clearest in the dependent variable within the model or analysis but should also be clearly stated within the title, abstract, or introduction. The focus could be `acculturation' but it could also be something else (that might, for example, be predicted by acculturation; e.g., depression).}

\textit{To identify the author(s) situational focus in their conceptualization of psychological acculturation, you can examine the manuscript for self-identified mentions of life domains. Please place a particular focus on the study description, as well as the methodology, including scale descriptions, the (sub-)scale labels, and the  items themselves.}
