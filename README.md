This repository brings together the full manuscript (syncronized from Overleaf) as well as all data sets and their analysis markdown files (syncronized from a local RStudio instance in RMarkdown files).

The full annotated analysis code is available here: [Supplemental Material B - Annotated Review Analysis](https://janniscodes.github.io/acculturation-review/Supplemental-Material-B-Annotated-Analysis)

An interactive directory of the 233 acculturation scales and 93 acculturation theories included in the manuscript is available here: [Acculturation Directory](https://acculturation-review.shinyapps.io/acculturation-directory/)

Please note that the full repository will remain 'private' until after the manuscript has been accepted for publication (to allow for blind peer review).
