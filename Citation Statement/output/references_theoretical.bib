  Abstract = {With the effectiveness of therapeutic agents ever decreasing and the increased incidence of multi-drug resistant pathogens, there is a clear need for administration of more potent, potentially more toxic, drugs. Alternatively, biopharmaceuticals may hold potential but require specialised protection from premature in vivo degradation. Thus, a paralleled need for specialised drug delivery systems has arisen. Although cell-mediated drug delivery is not a completely novel concept, the few applications described to date are not yet ready for in vivo application, for various reasons such as drug-induced carrier cell death, limited control over the site and timing of drug release and/or drug degradation by the host immune system. Here, we present our hypothesis for a new drug delivery system, which aims to negate these limitations. We propose transport of nanoparticle-encapsulated drugs inside autologous macrophages polarised to M1 phenotype for high mobility and treated to induce transient phagosome maturation arrest. In addition, we propose a significant shift of existing paradigms in the study of host-microbe interactions, in order to study microbial host immune evasion and dissemination patterns for their therapeutic utilisation in the context of drug delivery. We describe a system in which microbial strategies may be adopted to facilitate absolute control over drug delivery, and without sacrificing the host carrier cells. We provide a comprehensive summary of the lessons we can learn from microbes in the context of drug delivery and discuss their feasibility for in vivo therapeutic application. We then describe our proposed “synthetic microbe drug delivery system” in detail. In our opinion, this multidisciplinary approach may hold the solution to effective, controlled drug delivery.},

We present data on the contemporary second generation and review the challenges that it confronts in seeking adaptation to American society. The concept of segmented assimilation is introduced to describe the diverse possible outcomes of this process of adaptation. The concept of modes of incorporation is used for developing a typology of vulnerability and resources affecting such outcomes. Empirical case studies illustrate the theory and highlight consequences of the different contextual situations facing today's second generation.},

  Abstract = {The theme of this conference focusses attention on conflict and negotiation. In this paper, I take one example of these issues, and examine the cultural and psychological aspects of these phenomena that take place during the process of acculturation. During acculturation, groups of people and their individual members engage in intercultural contact, producing a potential for conflict, and the need for negotiation in order to achieve outcomes that are adaptive for both parties. Research on aculturation, including acculturation strategies, changes in behaviours, and acculturative stress are reviewed. There are large group and individual differences in how people (in both groups in contact) go about their acculturation (described in terms of the integration, assimilation, separation and marginalisation strategies), in how much stress they experience, and how well they adapt psychologically and socioculturally. Generally, those pursuing the integration strategy experience less stress, and achieve better adaptations than those pursuing marginalisation; the outcomes for those pursuing assimilation and separation experience intermediate levels of stress and adaptation. Implications for public policy and personal orientations towards acculturation are proposed. With respect to the conference theme, since integration requires substantial negotiation, but results in the least conflict, the concepts and findings reviewed here can provide some guidance for the betterment of intercultural relations. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract = {This study presents the concordance model of acculturation (CMA), which was developed with reference to Berry's acculturation model (Berry, 1997). A comparison of the attitudes of a dominant and a non-dominant group gives rise to four levels of concordance that represent different possibilities of (mis)matched attitudes: consensual, culture-problematic, contact-problematic, and conflictual. A basic assumption of the CMA is that the greater the mismatch in attitudes, the more threatening and less enriching the intergroup situation will be perceived to be. This assumption was tested in a survey study comparing the attitudes of Germans (N = 265) with the attitudes they imputed to Polish or Italian immigrants. We were able to show that the level of concordance is related to perceived intergroup threat and/or enrichment when controlling for the underlying acculturation attitudes: the greater the concordance between the dominant group's acculturation attitudes and the attitudes imputed to immigrants, the lower the perceived threat and the higher the perceived enrichment. © 2002, Sage Publications.

In addition to raising critical questions about this line of research, the chapter examines some underlying assumptions and their implications for the study of acculturation in younger people. It is argued that ambiguities in the final outcome of acculturation and differences in acculturation experiences of adults and children make it necessary to bring developmental perspectives closer into this line of research among children and adolescents in immigrant families. Against this background a modified developmental contextual model is suggested as an alternate perspective to the understanding of the acculturation of children and adolescents.},

  Volume = {14},
  Year = {1990},
  Abstract = {This study attempts empirically to distinguish psychological and sociocultural forms of adjustment during the process of cross-cultural transitions. One hundred and five sojourners (Malaysian and Singaporean students in New Zealand) completed a questionnaire which examined psychological well-being (depression) and sociocultural competence (social difficulty) in relationship to the following variables: expected difficulty, cultural distance, quantity and quality of social interactions with both host and fellow nationals, attitudes towards hosts, extraversion, Iife changes and personal variables such as age, sex, length of residence in New Zealand, cross-cultural training, and previous cross-cultural experiences. Multiple regression analysis was employed to construct predictive models of psychological and sociocultural adjustment. Satisfaction with relationships with host nationals, extraversion, life changes, and social difficulty combined to account for 34\% of the variance in psychological adjustment. Cultural distance, expected difficulty, and depression combined to account for 36\% of the variance in sociocultural adjustment. It was concluded that although psychological and sociocultural adjustment are interrelated, there is a need to regard these factors as conceptually distinct. In the last two decades research in the general area of culture contact and change, concentrating on such diverse groups as immigrants, refugees , sojourners, and native peoples, has flourished. The expanding field, however, has been plagued by a variety of problems, in particular the lack of consensus across studies as to the appropriate theoretical frameworks for investigation of the phenomena and the lack of agreement on definitions of key constructs. With specific reference to sojourn-er research, a major detriment to advances in the study of cross-cultural},

  Volume = {49},
  Year = {2011},
  Abstract = {This article proposes expanding Berry's theory of acculturation strategies into a three-fold model to be applied to the case of acculturation among migrants. The expanded model includes the community of co-migrants as a distinct referent. It addresses the dynamic and multi-directional relationship between the three referents and the individual migrant, which all interact to create the experience of acculturation among migrants. An expanded typology is presented representing positive or negative attitudes toward each referent. The typology delineates eight possible strategies of acculturation among migrants, namely positive attitudes towards all three referents, negative attitudes towards all three, and the six possible variations between these extremes. Though not previously conceptualized and formalized, examples of all eight strategies were found in the existing literature. Some examples are cited, supporting the assertion that in the socio-psychological phenomenon of acculturation among migrants, the community of co-migrants plays a role which may be differentiated from the home culture and the host culture referents of the Berry model. The model provides a structure for exploring expression of these acculturation strategies among various sub-groups within a community of co-migrants. The current article is essentially a hypothesis paper, citing support for each of the proposed strategies of acculturation from published empirical studies carried out among a wide variety of migrant populations. A preliminary testing of the typology (Taieb, 2008) found that the cultures of the home, host and co-migrant communities do play distinct roles in the acculturation process, and verified that the eight profiles may be recognized in an empirical study. Directions for further empirical verification and refining the preliminary model are suggested. © 2010 The Author. International Migration © 2010 IOM.},

  Volume = {142},
  Year = {2016},
  Abstract = {Cross-cultural research has traditionally emphasized predicting adjustment, treating it as a level to be achieved more than a change process to be understood and controlled. The lack of focus on process integration has inhibited our understanding of precisely why and how adjustment processes unfold and ultimately cause (dys)functional change in criteria. In response, we review the motives and processes of cross-cultural adjustment and integrate these into a theoretical framework, examining the discrete episode of expatriate-host national interaction as the focal vehicle for change. First, we synthesize the general causal sequence within an interaction episode. We then summarize state inputs that condition processing. Next, we describe identity management and learning processing in depth. Then, we discuss key interactions among the motive and processing categories. Finally, we orient the cross-cultural interaction episode within the nomological network of cross-cultural adjustment predictors and criteria. This framework prescribes that an expatriate should initially reduce acculturative stress through repeated, functional identity management and learning processing of novelty encountered in cross-cultural interaction episodes. To do so, one must avoid inhibitory input states and the many potential processing failures identified here. If the expatriate experiences enough such functional interaction episodes, a "Stage 2" is reached where the motive to reduce stress has been largely overcome, and thereafter, interaction episode processing proceeds more functionally in general.},

We present a conceptual model for the development of expertise in navigating across cultures, delineating how community characteristics interact with family and individual practices to create the conditions under which children develop expertise in navigating multiple cultural worlds and identities. Core constructs and propositions about the nature of relations are derived from a multidisciplinary review of extant scholarship. To illustrate an application of the model, we compare two waves of immigration to the US from the Indian subcontinent and derive potential hypotheses about how differences in immigration history and circumstances of settlement in the host country are associated with the processes of negotiating identities.

  Volume = {56},
  Year = {2015},
  Abstract = {Acculturation to the culture of the host society as well as to one’s heritage culture have been shown to impact immigrants’ adjustment during the years following resettlement. While acculturation has been identified as an important factor in adjustment of Vietnamese immigrants (Birman and Tran in Am J Orthopsychiatr 78(1):109–120. doi:10.1037/0002-9432.78.1.109, 2008), no clear pattern of findings has emerged and too few studies have employed an ecological approach. The purpose of this paper is to contextualize the study of acculturation and adjustment by taking an ecological approach to exploring these relationships across several life domains, using a bilinear scale, and examining mediators of these relationships for adult Vietnamese refugees (N = 203) in the United States. We call this approach the Ecological Acculturation Framework (EAF). Results of a structural equation model (SEM) showed that job satisfaction fully mediated the relationship between American acculturation and psychological distress, demonstrating that this relationship was specific to an occupational domain. However, while Vietnamese acculturation predicted co-ethnic social support satisfaction, it did not predict reduced psychological distress. Implications for a life domains approach, including domain specificity, are discussed.},

  Volume = {29},
  Year = {2005},
  Abstract = {The worldwide volume and social relevance of migratory processes justify the need to study the psychological acculturation of the host and immigrant populations through a model adapted to the social context in which they develop. Therefore, the main objective of this article is to carry out a review of some of the existing acculturation models (e.g., Berry, Kim, Power, Young, \& Bujaki. (1989). Applied Psychology, 38, 185-206; Bourhis, Moïse, Perreault, \& Senécal. (1997). International Journal of Psychology, 32(6), 269-386; Piontkowski, Florack, Hoelker, \& Obdrzálek. (2000). International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 24, 1-26), ending up with a proposal for a Relative Acculturation Extended Model (RAEM). This theoretical framework gathers some elements from previous models and adds some new ones in order to offer new explanations for the acculturation strategies and attitudes preferred by both the native and immigrant populations. The most relevant contributions of the RAEM can be summarised as, on the one hand, the consideration of different acculturation domains (political, work, economic, family, social, religion and ways of thinking) and on the other, the differentiation between the acculturation strategies adopted in reality and the acculturation attitudes ideally preferred by the groups in contact. This model also takes into account the ethnocultural origin of immigrants and some variables predicting and modulating their acculturation strategies and attitudes. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Differences in BII, acculturation stress, and bicultural competence were measured with new instruments developed for the purposes of the study. Using a sample of Chinese American biculturals, we found that variations in BII do not define a uniform phenomenon, as commonly implied in the literature, but instead encompass two separate independent constructs: perceptions of distance (vs. overlap) and perceptions of conflict (vs. harmony) between one's two cultural identities or orientations. Results also indicated that cultural conflict and cultural distance have distinct personality, acculturation, and sociodemographic antecedents. © Blackwell Publishing 2005.},

We meet the challenge of this problem by conceptualising a theoretical model using a liminal lens; more specifically, through the three thematic lenses of liminality as process, liminality as position and liminality as place. By addressing the research question; ‘how does a liminal lens provide new insights into refugees' integration into the workplace?’ we make three contributions to extant literature. First, we offer a dynamic perspective of refugees' integration into the workplace. Second, we provide a synthesis that brings together key factors at the micro, meso and macro levels that are germane to refugees' assimilation into the workplace. Finally, we contribute to human resource (HR) literature by showing a more nuanced view of the role of human resource management, specifically how an ambidextrous HR architecture can help firms explore refugees as a talent pool, while exploiting existing talents.},

  Abstract = {This paper examines the various ways in which the concept of "diaspora" has important implications for rethinking traditional notions of acculturation in Psychology. In this paper, we argue that the idea of a fixed, invariant, and apolitical notion of acculturation dominates much of Psychology, and as such it needs to be revised and reexamined in light of transnational migration and global movements. Drawing on our previous and current scholarship on acculturation and identity [Bhatia, S., \& Ram, A. (2001). Rethinking "acculturation" in relation to diasporic cultures and postcolonial identities. Human Development, 44, 1-17; Bhatia, S., \& Ram, A. (2004). Culture, hybridity and the dialogical self: Cases from the South-Asian diaspora. Mind, Culture, and Activity, 11(3), 224-241; Bhatia, S.

Rethinking culture and identity in psychology: Towards a transnational cultural psychology. Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology, 28, 301-322], we provide a counterargument to models of acculturation that claim that all immigrants undergo a universal psychological process of acculturation and adaptation. More specifically, we show how members from the Indian diaspora reexamined their acculturation status after the events of 9/11. We use interdisciplinary research to critically examine the role of race in the acculturation process. In addition, we provide a new analytical framework to understand the larger structural forces that shape the acculturation and assimilation process of transnational and diasporic migrants. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  Volume = {23},

  Abstract = {The rate of international migration has reached unprecedented levels over the past few decades (Schwartz, Unger, Zamboanga, \& Szapocznik, 2010). According to the International Organization for Migration, the number of migrants worldwide was 244 million in 2015. Current literature in cross-cultural adaptability describes acculturation as a 4-phase process, namely honeymoon, crisis, adjustment, and biculturalism (Sawyer, 2012). This approach characterizes all migrants equally, regardless of the type of migrant. This approach however is missing other factors such as an individual’s developmental stage, needs, interests, and exposed/reinforcing memes. Orientations of these characteristics can vary drastically from one immigrant to another, and play an important role in acculturation outcomes. For a successful transition, immigrants and natives alike need to form successful relationships, while immigrants discover how systems work in the new country, and learn how to pursue their goals using the new resources in their new environment. These adaptive behaviors displayed by immigrants and natives are analyzed using stage theory, Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, interests, and memes. In this article, we explore why some individuals and groups adapt better than others. A low-acculturated immigrant operates at a lower stage, may have been and continue to be exposed to memes that are less diverse, have lower needs, and choose more traditional careers. A highly acculturated immigrant operates at a higher stage, may be exposed to more diverse memes, have higher needs and choose more nontraditional careers. Through this analysis, we hope to contribute to a better understanding of immigration processes of different immigrants.

Differences in integration contexts include institutional arrangements in education, the labour market, housing, religion and legislation. Differences in the social and political context are especially important for social and cultural participation and belonging. The TIES data show high degrees of local involvement in the second generation and the dwindling centrality of single ethnic belongings - a reflection of the dramatically changing ethnic and (sub)cultural landscapes in cities in Europe.

It also provides a number of factors involved in the acculturative process and attainment of acculturative goals for the participants. Social, psychological, cultural, and environmental supports and barriers are presented that impact the acculturative process. Findings suggest that the level of acculturation attained resulted from decisions made by the participants and their perceptions of their own autonomy and empowerment.

  Abstract = {We outline a theory of cultural transmission in socio-cultural minorities in a foreign cultural environment. The explanatory focus of the theory is on the educational activities of minorities and on the educational policies of the majority towards them. The theory comprises two components referring to, respectively, the proximate psychological mechanisms and the distal cultural-evolutionary processes that underlie minority- majority interactions. The first theory component is an action-theoretical model of the interaction between majorities and minorities in the educational domain. A central assumption of this model is that socio-cultural groups have a culture-transmission motive, i.e. a desire to maintain and transmit their culture. The second component of the theory consists of a set of assumptions about the evolution of socio-cultural groups that provides an enhanced understanding of the basic goals and strategies of minorities and majorities in cultural-transmission situations. It is argued that the theory allows an explanation of several findings that pose difficulties to existing theories, in particular, the frequently observed stability of cultural traits in ethnic minorities. © The Author(s) 2013 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.},

  Year = {2012},
  Abstract = {Introduction The well-being of immigrant youth – of the first or second generation – is intimately tied to their socioeconomic status and success, and these are important for social cohesion in society. Institutional settings and policies vary greatly from one country to the next, so studying key outcomes for immigrant youth in a comparative perspective illuminates which are most effective in promoting their well-being. In this chapter, a framework is presented for that exercise, highlighting recent literature on multidimensional well-being, social inclusion/exclusion, and child well-being. Then key findings from research on immigration and youth are examined within that framework in order to delineate the potential and the challenges associated with this approach to teasing out what works for immigrant youth. Capturing Well-being To assess the well-being of immigrant youth, one needs a clear conceptual perspective. There is now a substantial body of research focused on monitoring well-being, including across countries, from which much can be learned about the key dimensions of well-being and how they are measured for the general population and for children and young people. This can provide a general framework within which to set assessment of the situation of immigrant youth, supplemented by specific features of particular relevance for them (for a review see Fahey, Nolan \& Whelan, 2003).},

  Volume = {65},
  Year = {2010},
  Abstract = {This article presents an expanded model of acculturation among international migrants and their immediate descendants. Acculturation is proposed as a multidimensional process consisting of the confluence among heritage-cultural and receiving-cultural practices, values, and identifications. The implications of this reconceptualization for the acculturation construct, as well as for its relationship to psychosocial and health outcomes, are discussed. In particular, an expanded operationalization of acculturation is needed to address the " immigrant paradox," whereby international migrants with more exposure to the receiving cultural context report poorer mental and physical health outcomes. We discuss the role of ethnicity, cultural similarity, and discrimination in the acculturation process, offer an operational definition for context of reception, and call for studies on the role that context of reception plays in the acculturation process. The new perspective on acculturation presented in this article is intended to yield a fuller understanding of complex acculturation processes and their relationships to contextual and individual functioning. © 2010 American Psychological Association.},

  Volume = {36},
  Year = {2012},
  Abstract = {In this study, a new acculturation intentions model (AIM) was formulated to help explain immigrants' preferences for different acculturation strategies and their further emigration intentions, i.e. their plans to either remain in the host country, return to their country of origin, or emigrate to a third country. The AIM applies the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991) to the case of immigration. In the present study, the AIM was assessed among high-school adolescents who immigrated from Russia and Ukraine to Israel as part of an educational program (n=151). The adolescents completed questionnaires twice: half a year before and three years after their immigration. In accordance with the theoretical model, attitudes towards the country of origin and the host country and perceived environmental constraints (including perceived discrimination as well as perceived social support from parents, peers, and teachers) affected the immigrants' acculturation intentions. In contrast with what was hypothesized in this study, immigrants' psychological resources were not related to their acculturation intentions. The significance of these findings for both the immigrants and the host society are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  Abstract = {As global migration increases worldwide, nursing interventions are needed to address the effects of migration on health. The concept of liminality emerged as a pivotal concept in the situation-specific theory of well-being in refugee women experiencing cultural transition. As a relatively new concept in the discipline of nursing, liminality is explored using a method, called ID-EA , which we developed to advance a theoretical concept for application to nursing practice. Liminality in the context of cultural transition is further developed using the five steps of inquiry of the ID-EA method. The five steps are as follows: (1) inductive inquiry: qualitative research, (2) deductive inquiry: literature review, (3) synthesis of inductive and deductive inquiry, (4) evaluation inquiry, and (5) application-to-practice inquiry. The overall goal of this particular work was to develop situation-specific, theory-based interventions that facilitate cultural transitions for immigrants and refugees.},

  Year = {2018},
  Abstract = {HRM and Migration scholars increasingly employ Bourdieu’s concepts of capitals, fields and habitus to explain the interrelationships between migrant careers and context. Both literatures employ a Bourdieusean framework to examine devaluation of migrant capitals in host nations and migrant responses to such devaluation. However, their explanations are based on different assumptions of context. HRM literature regards migrants as confined to the host nation context, whereas Migration literature places them in a transnational context, spanning both originating and host nations. In this conceptual paper, we argue for integrating transnational perspectives into HRM literature to offer a more accurate portrayal of contemporary migrant lives, and to capture greater nuance in migrant career experiences. We seek to expand the conceptual lexicon to support new conceptualisations of transnational context, and to explore how locating a Bourdieusean framework in transnational contexts enhances its ability to explain migrant career experiences.},

  Volume = {5},
  Year = {2019},
  Abstract = {As the global mobility of the workforce increases, little is known regarding how cross-regime migrants from a centralized planned economy to a free market economy adapt to working in capitalist organizations. This study investigates the migration, work, and adaptation experiences of North Korean escapees living and working in capitalist South Korean society. Using grounded theory methods, we uncover an underlying mechanism of cross-regime work adaptation, the internalization of capitalist work norms into the migrants' personal values. This mechanism is linked with the migrants' adoption of an opportunity-focused approach to the new environment and the emergence of postmigration goals in response to perceived opportunities. This adaptation process is particularly characteristic of those motivated to escape for economic reasons, whereas those motivated to escape by political reasons actually resist assimilation. As a function of pre-and postmigration experiences, individual migrants are found to differ in their internalization of capitalist work norms-from high (integration of norms) to moderate (compliance with norms) to low (resistance to norms). High internalization is linked to such work-related adaptation behaviors such as acquiring new skills and building supportive workplace relationships. We offer theoretical and practical implications for work adaptation in cross-cultural settings and for cross-regime migrants in particular.},

  Abstract = {The purpose of the present study is two-fold. First, it aims to develop a theoretical model of the acculturative process of immigrant adolescents based on the understanding of the relationships among acculturative stress, coping, and growth. Second, it aims to propose a typology that offers distinct patterns in the process of acculturation and the resulting outcomes. Using the grounded theory method, the study identified stress related to communication problems, ethnic prejudice, academic pressure, homesickness, and interpersonal conflict. The lack of social support and the school climate were identified as contextual factors of perceived stress. Peer mediation and motivation were identified as intervention factors of coping behaviors. The immigrant adolescent coping behaviors included media use for emotional release, focus on a goal, connectedness to the home country, and the creation of social capital in the host country. The typology of different acculturative patterns classified immigrant adolescents into three types: adaptive, academic, and competent. Based on the findings, the significance of family functioning, peer mediation, self-expansion motivation, and coping behaviors to create social capital for immigrant adolescents' normal development was discussed.},

  Abstract = {Starting from discussions on the validity of the classical assimilation concept, a general model for the explanation of different structural outcomes of interethnic relations is developed. The core of the model builds on the assumption that different outcomes are the often unintended and situation-logic results of (mis-)investments in and with ethnic and non-ethnic capital. Central initial conditions of the model are group size, social and cultural distances and the availability of social capital. The model specifies the mutual relations between these three constructs. Different variants of intergenerational integration of immigrants can thus be reconstructed as special cases of a general mechanism. © 2004 by the Center for Migration Studies of New York.

Based on survey data and quantitative analyses (general linear models), TPSOC and EPSOC were considered first separately and then combined, according to a bidimensional model of MPSOC that resulted in four combinations (dual membership, receiving society membership, ethnic membership, and no membership). The findings highlighted significant variations across groups. Among Albanian participants, both TPSOC and EPSOC were positively associated with integration and negatively with marginalization. Dual membership was positively associated with integration, prevailing ethnic membership with separation, and no membership with marginalization. Among Sri Lankan participants, EPSOC showed a positive association with separation. Dual membership was associated with marginalization, prevailing receiving society membership with assimilation, prevailing ethnic membership with separation, and no membership with integration.},

In addition, the composite score of the markers will provide a measurement of social inclusiveness; it reflects the depth of psychological barriers imposed by the individual in preserving the distinct boundaries of citizenship. Multivariate analyzes showed that the two groups reacted differently to the challenges and benefits from immigration. Surprisingly, naturalized citizens were more sensitive to the impact of perceived immigrant threats and contribution even though they imposed fewer barriers to the new arrivals in becoming a part of the mainstream society.

  Abstract = {Following a critique of Berry's model of 'acculturation strategies', the paper considers the relationship between heritage culture and ethnic identity. Analysis of processes of development, maintenance and redefinition of identity in contexts of alternative cultural norms contends with the assumption of conscious choice or strategy towards mainstream and heritage cultures. From the perspective of identity issues, enculturation of cultural elements rather than acculturation is often the more significant process. Going beyond critique to consider issues of the persistence of ethnic identity and processes of cultural reformulation, brings attention to the origins of primordialist sentiment within ethnic identity and the possibilities for generating situationalist perspectives. Reference to empirical investigations using Identity Structure Analysis (introduced as a conceptual framework for explicating complex identity processes) provides evidence for different identity processes and structures according to socio-historical context and the greater malleability of situationalists compared with primordialists in their empathetic identifications with alternative cultural groups. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract = {The immigration of French-speakers to Canada and their successful integration into Francophone minority communities has become a priority for the country's federal government. A critical ethnography served to challenge assumptions regarding successful integration embedded within government documents and to raise awareness of the challenges faced by French-speaking immigrants from visible minority groups residing within London, Ontario, Canada. A theoretical framework applying Goffman's concept of performance and Bourdieu's concepts of field, habitus, and capital guided the study. Eight migrants participated in up to five sessions including narrative and in-depth interviews, Occupational Mapping, and participation in occupations. Findings highlight that integration involves a process of 'starting over,' which entails becoming aware of differences in fields and habitus within and between home and host societies, learning 'how things work' in the host community, and negotiating performances in social interactions. This negotiation, enacted primarily through occupation, is influenced by differential access to forms of capital. It is further related to ways immigrants' intersecting identity markers are constructed within particular places and embedded in broader social systems and structures. These findings challenge the linear and individualized process of integration identified within government documents, and the narrow focus on economic productivity as the occupation-based marker of integration. © 2013 The Journal of Occupational Science Incorporated.},

  Abstract = {Research on the psychological well-being of refugees has focused on deficiencies within individuals either in terms of psychiatric symptoms or feelings of distress. To achieve a more holistic view of the life experiences of refugees, we need to look at the limitations of our current theoretical models. This article critically examines some of the major theoretical approaches that have guided research on the psychological well-being of refugees: the medical model, the psychosocial stress model and Berry's (1997) 'acculturation framework'. It goes on to examine Hobfoll's (2001) Conservation of Resources stress theory, a model which has important implications for refugee research. Drawing upon the models reviewed, the last section outlines a conceptual framework for adaptation among refugees. At the heart of it lies the concept of resources. However, resources must be understood in terms of the individual's needs, personal goals and the demands he or she encounters. Each of these concepts must be examined in the context of the pre-migration, flight and post-migration phases. The additional concept of constraints on the use of or access to resources is particularly relevant to the post-migration phase. Such a conceptual toolkit could prove especially useful in going beyond quantitative data to present the human stories of refugees. It could also sensitize researchers to the impact of host societies on the well-being of refugees. © The Author [2008]. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

This research examines the distributions of acculturation attitudes based on his original cultural maintenance-cultural contact conceptualization and on a later cultural maintenance-cultural adoption model. In line with the Relative Extended Acculturation Model it also compares the outcomes of real (self-reported behavioral) and ideal (attitudinal) assessments of acculturation. Two hundred and eighty-nine first generation immigrants in New Zealand participated in the study. In line with the hypotheses, integration occurred more frequently when derived from cultural contact than from cultural adoption and when acculturation was framed in attitudinal, rather than behavioral, terms. The findings point to the necessity of clearly defining the dimensions of acculturation, ensuring they are appropriately operationalized, and differentiating attitudinal and self-reported behavioral measures. The consequences of the operationalization of acculturation for its relationship to adaptation are also reported and discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  Volume = {38},
  Year = {2012},
  Abstract = {The transnationalism literature has focused on the transborder social networks that immigrants in the receiving country maintain with their sending countries and has not sufficiently examined how such transborder connections enable them to become simultaneously engaged in both nation-states. This paper argues that simultaneity is an important part of transnationalism that distinguishes it from long-distance nationalism. We therefore need to more extensively analyse how immigrants' transborder involvement in their home country simultaneously affects their participation in the host country. I suggest four ways in which the dynamic relationship between home- and host-country engagement can be conceived. The first is a zero-sum relationship, where increased engagement in one country leads to decreased involvement in the other. The second involves the side-by-side co-existence of sending- and receiving-country engagement without one directly influencing the other. The third is a positively reinforcing relationship, where increased engagement in one country leads to increased involvement in the other. The final option is a negatively reinforcing relationship. I illustrate these four types of transnational simultaneity with examples of migrant socio-economic, political, cultural and identity transnationalism. Finally I discuss their implications for the long-term engagement of immigrants in both sending and receiving countries. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

  Abstract = {The 75-year history of marginality theory is reviewed and evaluated, leading to the recommendation that the use of the marginality idea be discarded by social scientists because it lacks construct validity. A review of the literature reveals that, at present, the concept of marginality is employed in five different social science lines of investigation. These models are examined fromthe perspective of their contribution to the validity of the construct and are found wanting. Marginality is shown to be a concept that did not fulfill its promise of explaining the effects on people of immigration, culture clash, and other transitional situations, such as status, role, or class changes. Evidence is presented that marginality is unscientifically founded and has been applied so indiscriminately as to be useless in the social sciences.},

  Abstract = {This study applies facet theory to validate Berry’s bidimensional conceptualization and measurement of acculturation attitudes and its extension by Horenczyk to include acculturation expectations. Three components of facet theory (mapping sentence, confirmatory SSA [smallest space analysis], and SSA with external variables) are proposed as valuable tools for the purpose of cross-cultural validation and theory building. In total, 526 Israeli immigrants from the former Soviet Union completed questionnaires assessing own and "perceived expected" acculturation attitudes, as well as a questionnaire measuring the strength of their cultural identities. The bidimensional "radex" configuration of acculturation attitudes confirms expected distinctions (a) between integration, separation, assimilation, and marginalization types of acculturation attitudes and (b) between similarly structured own immigrants’ attitudes and the expectations attributed to hosts. Moreover, the distinct placement of group identifications and sociodemographic characteristics as external variables in the bidimensional space corroborates the concurrent and discriminant validity of the acculturation model and measurement.},

Each of these perspectives is discussed in accordance with its relevance to the acculturative processes operating in immigrants. They hypothesize that acculturation is more difficult for those persons who must cope with the stigma of being different because of skin color, language, ethnicity, and so forth.

  Volume = {23},
  Year = {2011},
  Abstract = {During the last two decades, the number of international migrants worldwide has constantly risen. In this context, cross-cultural dimensions of psychological disorders receive increased attention, especially depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorders among the migrant population. In this paper we propose a theoretical framework for the understanding of migrant mental health. This framework combines elements from Berry's acculturation model and Antonovsky's salutogenic theory. The former illustrates the main factors that affect an individual's adaptation in a new cultural context. The term acculturative stress denotes unresolved problems resulting from intercultural contact that cannot be overcome easily by simply adjusting or assimilating. The latter specifies the relationship between culturally associated stress and mental health more distinctive, introducing the concepts of generalized resistance resources and sense of coherence that determine mental health outcomes of migrants during acculturative stress periods. Specifically, we provide an integrative framework of acculturation and salutogenesis that helps to integrate inconsistent findings in the migrant mental health literature. The current paper focuses on the effect of resource factors for positive mental health outcomes in the migrant population and summarises some implications for future research activities. © 2011 The Institute of Psychiatry.},

  Year = {2014},
  Abstract = {The features of many peripheral sensory epithelia have been demonstrated to be labile to altered sensory inputs, however, the extent to which this is a global feature of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) has remained elusive. One way in which this can be studied is through investigations involving genetic mouse models for sensory hypofunction in the vestibular epithelia, since these peripheral structures are normally under constant sensory load throughout life. Here, it was investigated how altering vestibular sensory information to the inner ear epithelia (utricle, horizontal and superior cristae), using the otoferlin-null (Otof-/-) mouse may lead to presynaptic and/or postsynaptic changes in the expression of commonly expressed Ca2+ binding proteins oncomodulin (OCM, �- parvalbumin) or calretinin (CALB2). No alterations were observed in the presynaptic expression of OCM or CALB2, however, there was a marked heterogeneous decrease in postsynaptic CALB2 expression in the Otof-/- epithelia. These results suggest that some epithelial features (postsynaptic CALB2 expression) of the vestibular system are sensitive to the loss of OTOF and dynamic vestibular sensory inputs, while others (presynaptic OCM or CALB2 expression) are not. This may provide insight into how widespread the abilities of PNS sensory structures to adapt to changes in sensory information are, as well as how certain peripheral cellular features within the vestibular system are developed and maintained.},

After considering critical views of this theory, we present the most recent results from this longitudinal research programme in the form of quantitative models predicting downward assimilation in early adulthood and qualitative interviews identifying ways for the disadvantaged children of immigrants to escape it. Quantitative results strongly support the predicted effects of exogenous variables identified by segmented assimilation theory and identify the intervening factors during adolescence that mediate their influence on adult outcomes. Qualitative evidence gathered during the last stage of the study points to three factors that can lead to exceptional educational achievement among disadvantaged youths, and which indicate the positive influence of selective acculturation. Finally, the implications of these findings for theory and policy are discussed. © 2009 Taylor \& Francis.},

This framework emerges from interviews with 55 Spanish-speaking immigrants to the United States and results in four quadrants: (1) “pulled there” (feels loss of homeland strongly and prefers CO to the United States); (2) “neither here nor there” (does not feel loss of homeland strongly, however, prefers CO to the United States); (3) “mostly here” (does not feel loss of homeland strongly and prefers the United States); and (4) “here but pulled there” (feels loss of homeland strongly, however, prefers the United States). The conceptual framework of ALH and RS contributes to the immigration literature and is not exclusive to Latinos, but to the growing global immigrant and refugee population.},

Each factor may prove to be a resource or a challenge for educational performance. The various combinations of variables are claimed to produce segmentation in the acculturation paths both within and between ethnic groups. Judging from ethnographic data, many challenges are present in the case of Somali-speaking students.},

This chapter elaborates that the rational-choice theory and its core methodological principle, structural individualism, offers a valuable contribution to the human rights paradigm in general and explains variations in the institutionalization of human rights in particular. The respective interpretations of the core assumptions vary substantially between rational-choice approaches and all of them share the conviction that rationality, preferences, and individualism are crucial categories needed to explain human behavior and societal development. Flexibility in the interpretation of core assumptions makes rational-choice theory a broad and highly diverse theoretical paradigm integrating such distinct approach as neoclassical economics and social-rationality conceptualizations. Thus, an analysis of individual rationality implies the consideration of the available information and beliefs, of goals and preferences, and of opportunity/constraint structures simultaneously and in relation to each other.},

  Abstract = {Though the United States has become a place of increasing resettlement for refugees, particularly Iraqi refugees who have been forced to flee their homeland due to violence, persecution and civil unrest, little is known about Iraqi refugee resettlement in the United States, or the way in which resettlement impacts health and adjustment. A grounded theory study was conducted to develop a substantive theory of Iraqi refugee resettlement. Participants in the qualitative study included 29 Iraqi refugees and 2 community partners who participated in face-to face interviews. Data analysis and interpretation revealed fundamental concepts related to Iraqi refugee resettlement. Results of analysis showed that for Iraqis choosing to resettle here, the outcome is dichotomous: satisfaction or regret. The outcome is influenced by contextual factors as well as facilitating and hindering intervening conditions during the basic social process of resettlement transition. Each refugee's story is unique, yet all share common threads. This study allowed Iraqi refugees the opportunity to voice their personal experiences of resettling in America, and revealed life stories that inspire and illuminate a process that can guide health care delivery as they cope with the stresses of their journey. As a result, an in-depth storyline was established to explain the process of resettlement for Iraqi refugees. The development of this resettlement theory, grounded in Iraqi refugee experience, has the potential to guide nursing education, enhance the efficacy of practice, inform policy development and form the basis for research.},

As a research topic, migration importantly elucidates these general sociological questions. Literature on migration, integration and transnationalism lacks an encompassing theoretical model, which limits our understanding of complex integration processes. We propose a multifocal model of migrant integration including three key foci of integration: the host society; transnational sphere; and co-ethnic community in the host society. Moreover, the model considers integration in terms of different dimensions. With this model, we define multifocal marginalisation and study Russian, Kurdish and Somali migrants in Finland. We find that the different foci do not compete with each other, but are in a moderate positive relationship. There are clear group differences in integration patterns. Determinants of multifocal marginalisation include Kurdish background, weak Internet skills and older age. Discussion themes include belonging and social change.},

  Abstract = {Three of the basic goals of immigrants in multicultural societies - maintenance of heritage culture, participation in the host society, and maintenance of psychological and physical health-were examined as outcome variables in a proposed individual difference model of the acculturation process. The three composite predictor variables in the model were psychosocial adjustment, consisting of psychological well-being, bicultural competence, and perceived outgroup social support; connectedness to family and culture, consisting of family allocentrism, ethnic identity, and perceived ingroup support; and the experience of acculturation-specific and non-specific daily hassles. The roles of separation and assimilation modes of acculturation were also examined. The research participants were 85 male and 81 female Iranian immigrants to Canada. Their median age was 34 years; their median length of residence in Canada was seven years. The viability of the model was supported through Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Psychosocial adjustment was directly related to outgroup behavior (reflecting contact with the host culture) and to psychophysical distress. Connectedness to family and culture was directly related to ingroup behavior, and daily hassles were directly related to psychophysical distress. Furthermore, each of these predictor variables was associated with either or both modes of acculturation. In turn, these modes of acculturation predicted the outcome behavior variables. Implications of the model for further research are discussed.},

This concept helps us to fill the gap between scholars of migration and people’s movement on the one hand, and scholars of integration and incorporation in the new country, on the other hand. Migratory career must be considered as an additional concept to the traditional concepts such as integration, assimilation or incorporation, which are mainly focused on the situation of migrants in the receiving country. Furthermore, the use of the concept of migratory career allows to connect the theoretical thinking on migration to mainstream sociological theories.},

Both acculturative stress and acculturative change unfold in an ecological context. Within the family, acculturation discrepancies between parents and children affect acculturation trajectories and outcomes. At the institutional level, the school and workplace exert significant influences on the acculturation of young people and working adults, respectively. At the societal level attitudes, policies and prejudice affect the acculturation experiences of sojourners and immigrants and influence their psychological and socio-cultural adaptation.},

  Volume = {23},
  Year = {1999},
  Abstract = {The field of intercultural relations has devoted considerable attention to the idea of separate research paradigms. The distinctions between perspectives such as qualitative-quantitative, subjective-objective, functional-interpretive, etc., dominate theoretical and methodological writings. These distinctions are important for outlining the parameters of various research programs; however, many interesting issues in the cultural adjustment process deny the dichotomization of experience and require an approach that addresses a reality that is both reliable and present while at the same time situated and emergent. Recently our focus in the field has been trained on how we might bridge those distinct paradigms with a plausible intercultural theory. In the first portion of this article I outline three common research paradigms employed in intercultural relations. The social network perspective is then offered as a cross-paradigmatic research and theorizing approach. The conceptual history and relevant properties of social networks for intercultural research are described as part of the foundation for a theory of intercultural social networks that allows us to address the relational quality of intercultural interaction while acknowledging the stability of structural phenomena. I then propose seven assumptions and seven propositions comprising the beginning of a dynamic theory of intercultural social networks. Based upon the propositions put forward, future research avenues are suggested. I conclude that a socio-structural approach to acculturation, and the study of intercultural relations in general, is uniquely suited to capture and reconcile situated, emergent phenomena with reliable, present phenomena and increase our understanding of inter-cultural relations. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  Volume = {9},
  Year = {1985},
  Abstract = {In Part I, the process of adjustment to a highly unfamiliar environment is reconceptualized using three psychological constructs: applicability of behavior, clarity of the mental frame of reference, and level of mere adequacy. Using these constructs, a model of the process is postulated that goes beyond the symptom level in an attempt to understand intercultural adjustment from the perspective of cognitive and motivational psychology. In Part II, the model is first manipulated in order to specify the theoretically desirable changes that intercultural training should bring about with respect to each of the three psychological constructs. Then, the practical implications for intercultural training of each separate change are discussed in detail. Particular attention is paid to the goal of reducing the severity and shortening the duration of culture fatigue, which is viewed as the principal objective of training. The importance of continuing training during the early stages of the sojourner's experience in the unfamiliar environment is especially stressed. © 1985.},

  Title = {Immigrants' {Political} {Suitcases}: {A} {Theory} of {Imported} {Socialization}},
  Year = {2009},
  Abstract = {People’s experiences throughout their lives influence their later thoughts and actions, including thoughts and actions about politics. This straightforward logic motivates attention to childhood political socialization, habitual voting, and a host of other phenomena. Yet, when it comes to studies concerning the political behaviors of immigrants to the United States, the scholarly norm has been to assume that these individuals entered the nation as political blank slates; that is, we ignore the possible influence of experiences in immigrants’ nations of origin. By contrast, this study develops and tests a theory of imported socialization in an effort to understand how immigrants’ political socialization experiences before they left their countries of origin shape the way they view the new polity after migration; the extent to which this imported socialization affects their degree of post-migration political engagement; and finally for how long the content of immigrants’ political suitcases remains consequential during their civic lives in their new home. Specific questions examined include the extent to which immigrants’ political baggage affects the intensity and the directionality of that post-migration political engagement. My findings suggest that political suitcases indeed play a key role on the political acculturation of the newcomers.},
