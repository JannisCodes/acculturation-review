This supplementary information elaborates on the background literature of the contextual aspects of our conceptual framework presented in the main text. We would like to address each of the four contextual factors in more detail: (1) Cultures, (2) individuals, and (3) situations.

\section{Culture} 
% Culture as social facts and Cultural adaptation as tension between different social facts.
The most prominent contextual factor of psychological acculturation is probably the concept of culture. Functional structuralists, who tried to structure the concept of culture, have defined culture as external social expectations focused on our "manners of acting, thinking and feeling, which are invested with a coercive power by virtue of which they exercise control over him" \citep[][p. 52; on social facts]{Durkheim1982, Gilbert1989}. Within the sociological literature, these social influences can be divided into the formal social facts (e.g., laws, regulations, policies, history, language), informal social facts \citep[e.g., norms, values, beliefs, rituals, customs; also see][]{Herzog2018}, as well as more material cultural products or artifacts \citep[e.g., food, fashion, architecture, or arts, such as film, music, literature, and fine arts; e.g., see][]{Alexander2001}. The content of these external influences will likely be relevant in the expected patterns of behavior (e.g., dress or communication styles), cognition (e.g., sense of race-, class-, gender-, and sexual identities), emotions (e.g., expressions of emotions), and motivations (e.g., virtues and duties).

At the same time affect, behaviors, cognitions, and desires also drive what we consider `cultures' to be \citep[e.g.,][]{Varnum2017}. For example, cultural knowledge, values, identities, beliefs, and attitudes are likely the most widely discussed aspects of non-material culture \citep[e.g.,][]{DiMaggio1997}, some indigenous cultural practices are legally protected as manifestations of culture \citep[Art. 11]{UnitedNations2007}, shared emotions are an integral part of culture creation in narratives \citep[e.g.,][]{Ahmed2014, Kitayama1994, Smith2016c, Sundararajan2015}, and motivational ideals or oughts form the basis of many cultural discussions \citep[e.g., see][]{Markus1991}.

In the case of psychological acculturation, an individual needs to deal with (at least) two sets of cultural expectations --- their heritage culture and the culture of the new environment \citep[e.g., see models of][]{Berry1997b, Berry2006a}. The individual will thus have to negotiate their individual response to the cultural expectations by their heritage and host culture. Once we consider culture as external influences on emotions, behaviors, cognitions, and desires and psychological acculturation as the individual adjustments to the presence of multiple cultural influences, it becomes apparent that the experience framework may be ideally suited to discuss the concept of culture. The psychological acculturation experience (i.e., the individual experience of ABCD) allows one to capture the adjustment to tension as a result of differing external expectations of affect, behavior, cognition, and desire. Studying psychological acculturation in the experience framework then also allows us to reflect on which cultures' social expectations are considered in the conceptualization of acculturation \citep{Bhatia2001}. 

As part of the analyses presented in this paper, we will offer such a reflection by extracting the cultures for which acculturation measures were validated and investigated in empirical papers. This allows us to examine how much the external influences of culture on motives, emotions, thoughts, and behaviors are reflected within structural differences of measures and definitions (that is, if we can consolidate a meaningful number of studies per cultural context).

\section{Individual} 
%% Individual based on inter-group contact and Berry: 
% Individual differences in general (e.g., age, gender) but also migration related differences (e.g., reason for migration, language proficiency)
Another contextual factor to consider during the cultural adaptation process are the interacting individuals themselves. There has been a rising focus on the idea that acculturation centers around the daily interpersonal interactions a person has with people of the other group \citep{Maxwell2017, Sam2010}. And although it can, at times, be difficult to disentangle cultural from individual influences, there are a range of personal features that likely influence the cultural adaptation process. These personal differences might relate to relatively stable individual differences, such as gender or personality, but also migration related differences, such as the reason for migration (e.g., voluntary vs. forced migration), cultural distance, or migration status. Within the migration related factor we would also include aspects that might change over the course of the adaptation process but give migrants different starting positions, such as language skills and education level.
Similar to the influences of cultures, the individual differences of the interaction partners (if there are multiple people) will likely impact the cultural adaptation. And similar to culture, individual differences likely play a role for multiple aspects of the cultural adaptation process (also see Figure \ref{fig:SupModelContext}). As part of this study, we will mainly analyze the migration relevant differences. Considering individual differences on a larger, cross-study level we will mainly extract data on the type of samples collected within the validation and the empirical papers (e.g., forced vs. voluntary, youth, or clinical samples). If we find reasonable numbers of studies with specific types of samples, we will assess whether these individual differences are related to structural differences in measures or definitions used by the authors.

\section{Situation} 
%% Situations as domains of psycho-social functioning: 
% Many theories have come up with life domains that form different cultural interaction situations.
Beyond the cultural group and the individuals, the interactions of cultural adaptation are further dependent on the situational context. One way of structuring this situational context is what we will here refer to as the \textit{domains of psycho-social functioning} -- the idea that the social experience will take place within different domains in life. There are many social-scientific theories that have discussed these spheres of life. One famous example is Bronfenbrenner's Ecological systems theory \citep{Bronfenbrenner1992}, according to which humans get into contact with others, and society at large, through a number of environmental systems that range from the closest relations (e.g., family or colleagues) to the more remote relationships (e.g., mass media or societal services). A similar framework was suggested by prominent theorists of the (structural) functionalist traditions with the concept of social institutions \citep[e.g.,][]{Turner1997}. According to these sociological theorists, it is through societal institutions (commonly: family, government, economy, media, education, healthcare, and religion) that culture is transmitted and maintained \citep[e.g.,][]{Durkheim1982}. Similar ideas for domains of interaction with society and culture have also been proposed within the acculturation literature. \citet{Arends-Toth2006, Arends-Toth2007} have, for example, suggested 15 public and private life domains (e.g., education [public], child-rearing [private]) in which acculturation takes place. Empirical research in the individual acculturation field, have also provided evidence that acculturation processes can develop separately and differently within these situational domains \citep[e.g.,][]{Arends-Toth2003a}. 

%% Point of convergence: 
% We aggregate a list of micro to macro domains from past literature.
What structurally unites the conceptualizations of life domains is the dimension of closeness to the individual. That is, most areas of life found in the literature can be arranged from the most immediate (i.e., micro or private, such as family) to the broadest levels (i.e., macro or public, including government or media). So, based on sociological theories of social institutions \citep{Durkheim1982}, literature on life domains in acculturation \citep{Arends-Toth2006, Arends-Toth2007, Zane2004}, a categorization of psychological influences by the British Psychological Society \citep{Michie2005a}, and Bronfenbrenner's Ecological systems theory \citep{Bronfenbrenner1992}, we conceptualized a range of life domains relevant to the migration process (also see Figure \ref{fig:SupModelContext}). Interestingly, most methodological and empirical authors mention explicitly which domains of acculturation they measure or very clearly focus on a limited number of domains in their measurement or definition of acculturation. As part of this study we will, therefore, extract information on the domains mentioned and measured in the literature. We will then assess whether different foci on life domains also show differences in their understanding and measurement of the motivational, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral cultural adaptation.

\section{Measurement}
As part efforts to capture the migration context we were interested in cultural, individual, situational, as well as process related contexts. Assessing these contexts in a manner that is relevant across a wide range of studies is challenging and likely superficial at best. Context is arguably more relevant if one considers a single case, yet gaining a more general understanding of the contexts frequently considered in the literature could prove useful in evaluating and comparing conceptions of cultural adaptation. We, thus, extracted a range of general context variables from the empirical literature.

\subsection{Cultural Context}
To capture the cultural contexts researched, we coded both the heritage country of the migrants as well as the country of the receiving host society. Coding the two societal contexts allows us to extract information on the specificity of the studies (e.g., Mexican migrants in the United States, vs any migrant in Scandinavia). Migrant and host country coding could also reveal patterns of interest within the literature (e.g., common migrant groups, common host societies, or common combinations investigated). And finally, if common clusters emerge, we could compare the types of experience elements assessed within each cluster (e.g., focus on behavioral adaptation in one and cognitive focus in another cluster). 

\subsection{Sample}
To capture the individual background on a cross-paper level, we extract the types of samples recruited by the authors. Some studies might focus on young or elderly samples, men or women only, clinical samples, or authors might simply recruit any migrant from a certain country or region. Clusters and differences in the experience foci within these clusters might offer insights into the understanding of cultural adaptation for different individual contexts.

\subsection{Life Domains}
To capture the situational focus of the authors, we coded which life domains the scales referred to. There were a range of ways in which we could identify the domains the authors wished to cover. Often times authors will explicitly mention which life domains their measure aims to capture. Others will mention clear domain focus as part of sub-scale or factor labels. If there is no explicit mention by the authors, questions are likely worded to refer to a specific life domain (e.g., behaviors at school, or values in the family context). If there is no clear reference to a life domain or the questions are about life in general, we code this as meaningful information as well. We can then process the situational foci as a list of domains, which offers information on the diversity of domains (e.g., number, or similarity of domains) but also the focus in the literature in general (e.g., frequency of domain across all articles). If clusters of similar focus domains emerge, we could, additionally, assess differences in the assessment of cultural adaptation for these clusters.
