To assess the past empirical and theoretical literature on psychological
acculturation, we performed a systematic \textcolor{blue}{scoping}
review. We first read seminal and review works within the field
\citep[including,][]{Ward2019, Berry1997b, Berry2003, Szapocznik1978, Sam2006a, Rudmin2003a}.
Based on our reading of the literature, we designed a comprehensive
literature search strategy in an iterative fashion. For the empirical
work on acculturation we performed a literature search on March
4\textsuperscript{th}, 2020 and February 14\textsuperscript{th}, 2021,
within the ``APA PsycINFO'' bibliographic databases using the
EBSCO\textit{host} provider. The databases also included the
PsycARTICLES, PsycBOOKS, and PsycCRITIQUES databases as well ProQuest
Dissertations with psychological relevance (for the full information on
the search strategy see
\hyperref[app:AppendixSearchStrategy]{Appendix \ref*{app:AppendixSearchStrategy}}.

Together with past reviews, we used this literature search to identify
validated scales as well as empirical works more generally. For the
theoretical literature we collected the theories used in the empirical
works and performed an additional, more specific, search of the same
databases as well as the Web of Science Core Collection using the
Clarivate Analytics provider on March 3\textsuperscript{rd}, 2021 (for
full information see
\hyperref[app:AppendixSearchStrategy]{Appendix \ref*{app:AppendixSearchStrategy}}).

From the literature searches we created three separate databases of
theoretical, methodological, and applied empirical works on
psychological acculturation. For each literature search, we downloaded
all references and abstracts, which two independent coders screened for
relevance after duplicate removal --- first based on the titles and then
based on the abstracts. We downloaded all relevant and available works
for full-text coding. For all three types of works we extracted a range
of variables to apply our framework. The full coding process and data
extraction are described in the online Supplemental Material A and B
\citep[also see our repositories;][]{Kreienkamp2021d, Kreienkamp2021e}.

\subsection{Theoretical Literature}

The most abstract level of our review was concerned with how researchers
conceptualized psychological acculturation in their theoretical work.
Our theory-specific literature search produced a total of 477 results
from which we identified 73 theories. From our review of the empirical
literature, we added an additional 19 theories (total N = 92, for
exclusion reasons, see \tblref{tab:ExclusionsCombined} and for the
PRISMA diagram see \fgrref[ A]{fig:PrismaCombined}. A full table of all
theories, with references, and final coding is available in our
Supplemental Materials as well as on our open science repository
\citep[see][]{Kreienkamp2021d, Kreienkamp2021e}.

\input{Tables/ExclusionsCombined}

\subsubsection{Methods}
\paragraph{Dataset}

The authors of the 92 included theoretical works self-categorized their
contributions as a theoretical conceptualization (\textit{N} = 9),
theoretical framework (\textit{N} = 26), theory (\textit{N} = 36), or
theoretical model (\textit{N} = 21). Looking at the types of theory
building, a majority of proposals were purely theoretical (N = 75) with
the remaining theoretical works growing out of qualitative
investigations (such as grounded theory approaches; N = 17).

\paragraph{Experience Aspects}

To assess the experience aspects that were considered as part of the
theoretical works, two independent coders coded the authors' axioms,
theorems, and model elements for self-identified inclusions of affects,
behaviors, cognitions, and desires (all inter-rater agreements were
96.74\% or above and all Cohen's \(\varkappa\)s were above 0.82,
\(\varkappa_{pooled}\) = 0.94; for full inter-rater reliability see
Supplemental Material B). We only coded explicit mentions by the authors
and we did so on three different levels. An example of these three
levels for affect would be phrases of ``mood'' or ``emotions''
(construct level), ``anxiety'' or ``pride'' (concept level), and ``the
migrant feels \ldots{}'' (operationalization level). A list with further
examples can be found in \tblref{tab:AspectExamples} and a full
description of the coding is available through our coding protocol (see
Supplemental Material A).

\paragraph{Process}

To assess the focus on psychological acculturation as a process or an
outcome, we coded whether authors self-identified the theory as a
process (e.g., `process', `development', `longitudinal', `temporal',
`dynamic') or an outcome (e.g., `static', `outcome', `markers',
`consequence').

\subsubsection{Results}

\paragraph{ABCD prevalence.}

Our main goal was to assess the use of the four affect, behavior,
cognition, and desire elements within the theoretical conceptualizations
of psychological acculturation. Looking at the overall usage of the
experience aspects we find that virtually all theoretical works included
behavioral aspects (94.57\%; e.g., cultural practices, media
consumption) and a vast majority considered cognitive aspects (90.22\%;
e.g., navigation knowledge, ethnic identification). We found
considerably less mentions of affective (46.74\%; e.g., anxiety, pride)
and motivational aspects (41.3\%; e.g., independence goals, need to
belong). But the generally high usage of the aspects, also meant that
only about a tenth of the theories focused on a single aspect (6.52\%).
Interestingly, all theories that considered only one aspect were
exclusively focusing on behaviors (N = 5) or cognitions (N = 1). Of the
remaining theories, 21 (i.e., 22.83\%) considered all four aspects,
leaving a majority of theoretical works to considered two aspects
(36.96\%) or three aspects (33.7\%). Among these, the most common
combinations of experience aspects were behavioral and cognitive
acculturation (28.26\%) or behavioral, cognitive, and motivational
aspects combined (17.39\%; also see \fgrref{fig:ElementsTheories} and
\tblref{tab:CombinedCooccurrences}).

\paragraph{ABCD composition.}

Looking at the number of aspects considered together we also see
substantial differences in what kind of theories include a certain
aspect. Theories that included behaviors considered an average of 1.78
other aspects (\textit{SD} = 0.78), and theories considering cognitions,
on average, also included 1.87 other aspects (\textit{SD} = 0.65).
Theories that included the more internal aspects of affect or desire
showed a considerably higher number of additional aspects considered
(affect: \textit{M} = 3.35, \textit{SD} = 0.52; desire: \textit{M} =
3.50, \textit{SD} = 0.36). Thus, most scales measure multiple dimensions
of acculturation (\textit{M} = 2.73, \textit{SD} = 0.79; also see
\fgrref{fig:LiteratureComparison}). Yet they tend to focus on more
external aspects of behavioral and cognitive acculturation, and less on
internal aspects of affects and desires. This is also visible in the
observation that there were no theories that exclusively focused on
emotional or motivational acculturation while this was the case for both
cognitions and behaviors. And if emotional or desire aspects were
considered they were found in theories that tended to already include a
higher number of other experience aspects.

\color{blue}
\paragraph{Process.}

To assess the process focus of the theoretical works, we assessed
whether authors self-identified their works as process or outcome
focused. We found that 49 of the 92 coded theoretical works proposed
dynamic conceptualizations of psychological acculturation (53.26\%).
This slight majority is a notably high percentage, considering that past
reviews of the acculturation literature have pointed to a small number
of studies actually offering dynamic tests of theories
\citep[e.g.,][]{Brown2011, Ward2019}.

\paragraph{Content.}

While it is beyond the scope of this paper to comprehensively summarize
and integrate the over 90 theoretical works on psychological
acculturation, we will briefly discuss how the different types of
theoretical works fit within a broader ABCD framework. To this aim, we
separate the acculturation process into three functional steps and
highlight some works in their use of the affect, behavior, cognition,
and desire aspects.

A broader pattern that emerged during our reading and coding of the
literature has been that theories focused on different phases of the
acculturation process. These phases can arguably be organized around the
timeline of actual inter-cultural contacts. In essence, we saw three
phases describing the affects, behaviors, cognitions, and desires that
are (1) normatively accepted by the relevant cultural groups
\textit{prior to the contact}, (2) actually experienced
\textit{during the contact}, and (3) experienced
\textit{after the contact}. We have, thus, termed these phases (1)
acculturation conditions, (2) acculturation responses, and (3)
acculturation outcomes (see
\fgrref{fig:ModelContext})\footnote{This approach is in line with previous step-wise conceptualizations \citep[e.g., process vs. outcome distinction;][]{Sam2006b} and step-wise models of acculturation \citep[e.g.,][]{Arends-Toth2006a, TeLindert2008a}. Yet, importantly each of these phases carry their own sets of affects, behaviors, cognitions, and desires. It should also be noted that inter-cultural contact can either be in person or through media, institutions, or cultural products.}.
While it would be beyond the scope of this paper (and likely overly
simplified) to summarize all theoretical ideas within each of the three
stages, in the following we would like to highlight a small selection of
works that illustrate the use of ABCDs within the experience stages.

\subparagraph{Acculturation conditions.}

Theoretical works that focused on the experience prior to the actual
inter-cultural contact, generally speaking, focused on the
socio-structural and personal expectations of the acculturation
experience. As an example, \citet[][]{Ward2016} in their contextualized
process framework highlight how culturally-expected ``behaviors, values
and identities'' (behavior and cognitions; p.~100) have a fundamental
influence on perceived cultural distance, the intercultural contact, and
the ensuing psychological changes, including well-being and emotional
distress (affect; p.99). They even embed this process further in a
series ecological contexts, highlighting the affordances and conditions
of the process. A second example might be Tartakovsky's
(\citeyear[][]{Tartakovsky2012}) `acculturation intentions model', in
which he argues that we should focus on attitudes, perceived social
norms, and perceived control pre-migration (i.e., cognitions; p.~85). He
argues that the future migrant will experience ``feelings of pride,
love, and comfort, {[}\ldots{]} or feelings of shame and discomfort''
depending on the attitudinal valence (i.e., affects; p.~86). The
attitudes and their emotional experience will then form ``the main
motivational forces that affect their {[}\ldots{]} desire to continue
living in this country'' (i.e., desires; p.~86) and will ultimately
determine acculturation intentions and behaviors (i.e., cognitions and
behaviors; p.~85 ff.). Tartakovsky also highlights that not only
perceived social norms and perceived control will impact the down-stream
experiences but also personal resources, and environmental constraints
determine the experienced
ABCDs\footnote{Further examples of theoretical works that include an explicit focus on acculturation conditions are \citet[][]{Kim1988, Rogler1994, Navas2005, Giles1977, Robinson2019, Serdarevic2005}.}.

\subparagraph{Acculturation responses.}

Theories that included a focus on the acculturation response tended to
focus on the affects, behaviors, cognitions, and desires during (or
immediately following) the inter-cultural interaction. One good example
of this phase comes from the now classic work of \citet[][]{Berry1992},
where he divided psychological acculturation into behavioral shifts and
acculturation stress. Berry then goes on to write that behavioral shifts
are ``changes in behaviour {[}\ldots{]} and include values, attitudes,
abilities and motives'' (i.e., behavior, cognition, desire; p.~70), and
acculturation stress is particularly manifested ``as lowered mental
health status (particularly anxiety, depression), feelings of
marginality and alienation'' (i.e., affects; p.~75). In Berry's
(\citeyear{Berry1992}) theorizing behavioral shifts and acculturation
stress jointly form `psychological acculturation', which follows
immediately after the inter-cultural contact. This phase is clearly
distinguished from the migrant's adaptation, which follows the
behavioral shifts and acculturation stress and in turn includes the
famous acculturation
strategies\footnote{Other examples of acculturation response focused theoretical works include \citet[][]{Berry2005, Sam2003, Riedel2011, Ward2016}.}.

\subparagraph{Acculturation outcomes.}

The third stage of acculturation outcomes are often the affects,
behaviors, cognitions, and desires that are more long-term and are often
explicitly after the actual intercultural contact is (temporarily)
concluded. One exemplary theory-building effort is arguably the work of
\citet[][]{Kim1988} with her `integrative theory of communication and
cross-cultural adaptation'. Not only does Kim do an excellent job at
discussing boundary conditions, and defining terms in the onset of her
work, but her theory is stringently built by explicitly formulating
assumptions, axioms, theorems; as well as embedding the theory within
broader meta-theoretical works. As one of her final theoretical steps
Kim (\citeyear[][]{Kim1988}) devotes an entire chapter on `adaptation
outcomes', which she begins with the definition of acculturation
outcomes: ``Gradually {[}migrants'{]} habitual patterns of cognitive,
affective, and behavioral responses undergo adaptive transformations
{[}\ldots{]} which enable them to fulfill their various human needs,
such as maintaining and enhancing social relationships and providing for
channels of self-expression and fulfilment'' (affect, behavior,
cognition, desire;
p.~138)\footnote{A number of other theoretical works has explicitly focused on acculturation outcomes, including \citet[][]{Baird2015, Berry1998, Berry1992, Berry2005, Riedel2011, Rogler1994, Luedicke2011}.}.

\subparagraph{Scope.}

It is important to mention that many of the theoretical works, including
most of the examples above, have focused on process models that span two
or more of the three steps
\citep[e.g.,][]{Berry1992, Ward2016, Arends-Toth2006a, Rogler1994}.
Additionally, a majority of the theoretical works we considered offered
commentary on the overall construct of acculturation (N = 63) and only a
minority of 29 works explicitly targeted a specific part of
acculturation (e.g., 7 identity acculturation theories and 4 labor
market acculturation theories; for an example see
\citealp{Weinreich2009}). Moreover, as the examples have already
highlighted, for many theoretical conceptualizations of psychological
acculturation authors discussed their focus on affect, behavior,
cognition, or desire aspects rather explicitly (which was also visible
in a high inter-rater reliability; for full coding details see
Supplemental Material B).

An additional functional benefit of the condition-response-outcome
separation has been the observation that several theoretical works sit
at the intersection between two of the steps. Several works were
specifically focused on the conditions under which acculturation
conditions lead to tension and changes in the acculturation responses
\citep[i.e., conditions of change; e.g.,][]{Masgoret2006, Alitolppa-Niitamo2004, Grove1985, Wood2014},
or under which conditions acculturation responses lead to stressful or
adaptive acculturation outcomes
\citep[i.e., conditions of stress; e.g.,][; also see \fgrref{fig:ModelContext} and Figure S1]{Ryan2008, Berry1992, Benet-Martinez2005, Salo2015, Wood2014, Hajro2019}.

A final observation has been that while the inclusion of desire
components was generally high within the theoretical literature, the
emphasis on desires and motivations was particularly prominent in the
grounded theories and other bottom-up works. As an example,
\citet[][]{Kim2019} developed a theoretical model based on the reported
importance of goals and motivations prior and during migration for
down-stream adaptation processes. Similarly, for
\citet[][]{Mchitarjan2015} one key determinant of acculturation
``success or failure'' are ``motivational factors, i.e.~the motives,
desires, or goals of the minority and majority'' (p.~2). \color{black}

\subsection{\textcolor{blue}{Psychometric} Literature}

Based on the systematic \textcolor{blue}{scoping} review and its coding,
the first empirical dataset we assess is a database of scale
validations. We bring together the scales suggested in previous reviews
as well as validation studies we identified in our own review.
Throughout our literature review, we found five major works that
reviewed the measurement of acculturation
\citep{Celenk2011, Maestas2000, Matsudaira2006, Wallace2010, Zane2004}.
After removal of duplicate scales, we added any scale validation that
was present in our own systematic \textcolor{blue}{scoping} review but
not included in the previous reviews. For each measure, we extracted the
full item list as well as the item scoring prior to coding. A
comprehensive and interactive database of the scales, with all available
items, reference- and publication information, as well as our experience
elements and -context coding are available in Supplemental Material D as
well as on our open science repository
\citep[see][]{Kreienkamp2021d, Kreienkamp2021e}.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\hl{TODO: SCALE REPOSITORY FIGURE HERE}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\subsubsection{Methods}  
\paragraph{Dataset}

After duplicate removal, these five reviews collected a total of 97
scales. From our own review, we added 159 additional validation studies
(total of 256 unique scales). Of these scales, we ultimately had to
exclude 23, because they were either not accessible or did not fit the
topic of our review (see \tblref{tab:ExclusionsCombined}). About a
quarter of scales (24.22\%) included majority group members in their
validation studies. The earliest included validation was from 1948 with
a majority of scales being validated around the turn of the
21\textsuperscript{st} century and the most recent included validation
study was published in 2020.

\paragraph{Experience Aspects}

We extracted data on the experience aspects by primarily focusing on the
measured concepts and their operationalizations (also see
\tblref{tab:AspectExamples}). For each article, we retrieved the items
used and coded whether the measure included references to affects,
behaviors, cognitions, and desires. Because this concerned the most
central aspect of our framework, each manuscript was double-coded and
inconsistent codes were resolved after discussion (all inter-rater
agreements were 97.85\% or above and all Cohen's \(\varkappa\)s were
above 0.95, \(\varkappa_{pooled}\) = 0.96; for full inter-rater
reliability see Supplemental Material B).

\textcolor{blue}{At this stage, we also noted if scales or items measured concepts that relate to multiple experience aspects. As an example, a single item asking about 'satisfaction with the new life' might include emotional and cognitive elements. In this case, we code the manuscript as measuring both emotions and cognitions, and noted that these elements are not measured independently. We also noted if the measures do not consider an individual's experiences, such as reporting migration status or length of residency.}

\paragraph{Process}

To extract an indicator of whether the scales were aimed at
psychological acculturation as a process or an outcome, we collected
information on assessed migration times (e.g., pre-migration,
post-migration) and the the validation type (e.g., cross-sectional,
longitudinal).

\subsubsection{Results}

\paragraph{ABCD prevalence.}

With our main aim of examining the experience structure within the
scales, we examined whether scales included a specific experience
element but also examined the used elements in their complex
combinations. In terms of general inclusion of elements, most studies
included a measure of cognition (87.55\%) and behavior (72.53\%),
whereas only roughly half the studies included a measure of affect
(50.21\%) and only a fourth of the scales included a measure of desires
(29.18\%). However, only a minority of scales included only a single
aspect. There were only 18 scales that exclusively relied on cognitions
(7.73\%) and 21 scales that measured only behaviors (9.01\%). Yet,
inversely, there were also only 35 scales that measured all four aspects
(15.02\%). Most studies measured two (38.63\%) or three (27.9\%)
aspects. A majority of scales either measured behavioral and cognitive
aspects (23.61\%) or behavioral, cognitive, and affective elements
(19.31\%; also see \fgrref{fig:ElementsScales} and
\tblref{tab:CombinedCooccurrences}).

\paragraph{ABCD composition.}

Looking at the number of aspects measured together we also see
substantial differences in what kind of scales include a certain aspect.
Scales that included cognitions also measured an average of 1.57 others
aspects (\textit{SD} = 0.77), scales measuring behavior, on average,
also included 1.62 other aspects (\textit{SD} = 0.77). Scales measuring
affect or desire measures included substantially more other aspects.
Scales that included affect measures also included 2.04 other aspects
(\textit{SD} = 0.61) and scales measuring desires even measured an
average of 2.31 other aspects per scale (\textit{SD} = 0.66; also see
\fgrref{fig:LiteratureComparison}). Thus, most scales measure multiple
dimensions (\textit{M} = 2.39, \textit{SD} = 0.91), yet they focus on
external accessible aspects of psychological acculturation (i.e.,
behavior and cognition), less of what is considered `internal' or
`subjective' (i.e., affect and desires). And if affect or desire
elements are considered, they often only occur in scales that already
include a higher number of other aspects. This is further underscored by
the observation that there were only 3 scales that exclusively measured
emotional acculturation and not a single scale that exclusively focused
on motivational acculturation (while this was the case for both
cognitions and behaviors).

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\caption{Methodological Literature: Bar graph of the experience element combinations.}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/ABCDFreq-1}
\label{fig:ElementsScales}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Process.}

To assess the process focus of the scales we also assessed the migration
time the scale validators considered. Except for a single scale that was
validated for potential migrants, all scales were validated using
cross-sectional data after the migrant arrived in the settlement
society. This is in line with observations by previous reviews of the
field \citep[e.g.,][]{Brown2011}.

\color{blue}
\paragraph{Content.}

While a discussion of all the topics addressed by the included scales
lies beyond the scope of this study, we would like to describe some of
the larger patterns authors have focused on. To that aim, we offer
illustrations of the patterns we observed during the reading,
extraction, and coding of the acculturation scales. We additionally, ran
a machine learning topic modeling procedure on the items of the scales
to identify content topics.

A first key observation is that there was considerable diversity between
the scales in how many experience aspects and topics were addressed.
That might not generally be surprising, considering that the scales had
between 1 and 136 items, and included between 1 and 12 life domains (see
Supplemental Material C). Additionally, scales were also either more
focused on a specific aspect
\citep[e.g., `Asian Value Scale';][]{Kim1999, Kim2004a} or aimed to
capture acculturation more broadly
\citep[e.g., `Asian American Multidimensional Acculturation Scale'][]{GimChung2004}.
Another trend that we observed was a separation between a factual and
counter-factual acculturation
\citep[e.g., real vs. ideal][]{Navas2005, Navas2007, BenetMartinez2006}.
Additionally, while a large number of scales separately assessed ABCDs
as they related to the dominant culture and the heritage culture, we saw
a trend towards explicitly asking about different life domains
\citep[e.g., family, work, media;][also see Supplemental Material C]{Kim2010a, Arends-Toth2007, Mancini2014}.

When considering the content of the aspects that were included across
acculturation scales, the topic modeling analysis offers a number of key
insights that mostly align with our reading of the literature. For the
topic modeling of the acculturation scales, we particularly used the
scale items in a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) analysis, an
unsupervised machine learning method common within the natural language
processing literature. The analysis essentially extracts sets of terms
that tended to occur together, assuming that scales that measure a
specific topic have more words that relate to the topic than scales that
measure other topics
\citep[we followed the procedures outlined by][for a full methodological detail see Supplemental Material B]{Schweinberger2022}.

While we had earlier described that many scales included a measurement
of behavioral acculturation, the topic modeling showed that one of the
main topics across the scales was language use. This included questions
about listening to, reading, and speaking the dominant local language.
In our own reading and coding of the literature we saw that while there
are a few (sub-)scales specifically targeting language use as a
conceptualization of acculturation
\citep[e.g.,][]{Deyo1985, ICSEYteam2006}, most scales used language as
only one of multiple experience aspects. Moreover, the assessment of
behavioral language use (and the more cognitive language proficiency)
often separated between language used at home and outside the home.
Similarly, some language assessments were distinguishing between the
languages used in different life areas
\citep[ e.g., media consumption, among friends, at work][for more information see Supplemental Material B]{Birman2002}.
Other behavioral measurements of acculturation included, among others,
the participation in and celebration of traditions and customs
\citep[e.g.,][]{Rezentes1993, Wilson2013, Cortes1994}, clothing
\citep[e.g.,][]{Ghuman2000}, food \citep[e.g.,][]{Schaefer2009}, and
political participation \citep[e.g.,][]{Jeong2016, Uslaner2005}. One
pattern that the topic modeling procedure highlighted was that food
related questions were often found in scales targeting the adaptation of
Asian migrants (in particular, Vietnamese, Indian, and Korean
acculturation scales).

Among the cognitive conceptualizations of acculturation, one key topic
that we saw both in the LDA and in our own review process is a strong
focus on ethnic identification and cultural identity ratings
\citep[e.g.,][]{Jadalla2015, Mchitarjan2015}. Other important topics
were belief- \citep[e.g.,][]{Klonoff2000} and value endorsement
\citep[e.g.,][]{Kim2010a, Wolfe2001, Duarte2020}, as well as preferences
\citep[e.g.,][]{BenetMartinez2006, Tull2003}.

Among the affective acculturation measurements an important distinction
was the separation by valence, often either assessing joy and happy
\citep[e.g.,][]{Phinney1992, Cuellar1995a} anxiety or loneliness
\citep[e.g.,][]{Shin1999, Perez2019}. A second observation was a
particular focus on self-conscious emotions, such as pride and shame
\citep[e.g.,][]{Tsai2000, Suinn1992}. A third pattern was that most of
the emotional measurements were of social emotions, such as comfort and
discomfort \citep[e.g.,][]{Stephenson2000}, or belonging or connected
feelings \citep[e.g.,][]{Kouli2009, Harder2018}.

Most of the motivational acculturation measurements (i.e., desires) were
related to wishes and wants for the future
\citep[e.g.,][]{Mancini2014, Ben-Shalom2003}. However, there was a
smaller subset of scales explicitly addressing specific motives, such as
transition motives \citep[][]{Mchitarjan2015}, motivation for cultural
exploration and maintenance \citep[][]{Recker2017}.

It should be noted that with the psychometric literature we saw a larger
number of instances where items targeted multiple experience aspects
\citep[e.g., enjoyment of wearing traditional clothing][]{Ozer2016} as
well as the measurement of concepts that included multiple experience
aspects \citep[e.g., satisfaction][]{Cuellar1995a}.

Finally, there were a few additional patterns that were particularly
hightlighted by the LDA topic modeling. These issues included a focus on
navigational issues \citep[e.g.,][]{Harder2018}, and acculturation
hassles \citep[e.g.,][]{Vinokurov2002}, as well the importance of family
and generational differences \citep[e.g.,][]{ICSEYteam2006, Lee2004b}.
Similarly, the topics showcased that the validated scales tended to
focus on specific cultural pairs, such as migrants from the former UDSSR
in Israel, or Mexicans and East Asians in North America (for more
information on the migration context see Supplemental Material B).

\subsection{Empirical Literature}

At the most applied level, we assessed the broader empirical studies.
This final database included the largest number of manuscripts and is in
theory the application of the theoretical and methodological literature.
The search produced a total of 1,629 results to which we added 133
articles through contacts with experts in the field and from referenced
works within the review. After duplicate removal, title--, abstract--,
and full-text screening we coded a total of 526 empirical works (for
exclusion reasons see \tblref{tab:ExclusionsCombined} and for the PRISMA
diagram see \fgrref[ C]{fig:PrismaCombined}).

\subsubsection{Methods}

\paragraph{Dataset}

Of the final works we coded, 452 were journal articles, 68 theses, and 6
book chapters. Most studies presented quantitative data (\textit{N} =
464), mixed methods (\textit{N} = 39), or qualitative data (\textit{N} =
20), while the remaining 3 manuscripts were reviews of empirical data.
Notably, a majority of the empirical investigations did not share common
measures of acculturation --- 391 studies used measures that were
reported a maximum of five times. A considerable majority of papers with
uncommon measures used new or ad-hoc measures of acculturation. Less
than a fifth of studies included local majority group members in the
study (\textit{N} = 77, 14.69\%). Acculturation most frequently was a
predictor variable (\textit{N} = 285, 54.39\%), a dependent variable
(\textit{N} = 148, 28.24\%), or a correlation variable (\textit{N} = 37,
7.06\%) in the empirical works. This pattern was mirrored when looking
at the focus of the papers, where a majority of the papers had
acculturation as their main focus (\textit{N} = 153, 29.48\%), with
other bodies of work focusing on health outcomes (\textit{N} = 163,
31.41\%), or inter-group relations (\textit{N} = 18, 3.47\%) as their
main outcomes. The earliest included study was published in 1948, with a
strong increase of publications after the year 2000, and a peak of
publications in 2012. We provide full descriptions of data extractions
and additional information about the data description in Supplemental
Material B.

\paragraph{Experience Aspects}

Extraction of the used experience aspects mirrored the methodological
literature assessment and we primarily focused on the measured concepts
and their operationalizations (also see \tblref{tab:AspectExamples}).
The only exception were qualitative studies, which we coded following
the same codebook of the theoretical literature. All aspects were coded
by two independent coders (all inter-rater agreements were 97.91\% or
above and all Cohen's \(\varkappa\)s were above 0.93,
\(\varkappa_{pooled}\) = 0.97; for full inter-rater reliability see
Supplemental Material B) and inconsistencies were resolved after
discussion.

\paragraph{Process}

To assess the static or dynamic conceptualization of the empirical
studies, we again collected information on assessed migration times
(e.g., pre-migration, post-migration) and additionally coded the type of
data collected and analyzed (e.g., cross-sectional, longitudinal data
and data analysis).

\paragraph{Context}

Contextual variables on sample, life domain, cultural groups,
measurement type, and variable type are again beyond the scope of the
framework validation but are presented in Supplemental Material C.

\paragraph{Field of Publication}

For the broader empirical literature, we also collected additional data
on the field the studies were published in. To that end, we merged the
`Scimago Journal Ranking Database' \citep{SCImago2020} with our
database. For all available journal articles, we added information on
key journal metrics (incl.~H index, impact factor, and data on the field
and audiences). This also meant that dissertations, book chapters, and
books were excluded from this analysis because data on their publishers
is not readily available or unreliable. Additionally, 19 journals were
not included in the Scimago database (because they do not have an ISSN
identifier or were discontinued before 1996, see Online Appendix B for
the missing journals). We ultimately had journal metrics for 425
empirical articles.

To summarize the journal data we then classified the journal fields into
super-ordinate discipline codes. These discipline codes are based in
part on the U.S. Department of Education's subject classifications
\citep[i.e., CIP,][]{InstituteofEducationSciences2020}, the U.K.
academic coding system
\citep[JACS 3.0,][]{HigherEducationStatisticsAgency2013}, the Australian
and New Zealand Standard Research Classification
\citep[ANZSRC 2020,][]{AustralianBureauofStatistics2020}, as well as the
Fields of Knowledge project \citep{ThingsmadeThinkable2014}. We
ultimately classified each journal into one of four mutually exclusive
disciplines (`psychology': \textit{N} = 122, `multidisciplinary':
\textit{N} = 102, `medicine, nursing, and health': \textit{N} = 144, and
`social sciences (miscellaneous)': \textit{N} = 45. For a full
discussion of the classifications see Online Supplemental Material B).

\subsubsection{Results}

We assessed the role of experience aspects in the measurement and then
compared differences between fields.

In terms of the overall frequencies of experience elements, the broader
empirical data mirrored that of the methodological literature. Most
studies included a measure of cognition (81.75\%) and behavior
(80.23\%), whereas only about half of all studies included a measure of
affect (49.05\%) and less than a fifth of the studies included a measure
of desires (18.63\%). Yet, only 126 studies focused on a single
experience aspect (\(N_{behavior\ only}\) = 73, \(N_{cognition\ only}\)
= 47, \(N_{emotion\ only}\) = 6). Similarly, only 46 papers included
measures of all four experience aspects (8.75\%). Most studies measured
three (36.12\%) or two aspects (31.18\%; \textit{M} = 2.30, \textit{SD}
= 0.86). Different from the scale validations, within the broader
empirical works, most works included measures of emotions, behaviors,
and cognitions (\textit{N} = 158, 30.04\%), with a further substantial
number of articles measuring behaviors and cognitions (\textit{N} = 107,
20.34\%. Also see \fgrref{fig:EmpPlotFreq-1} and
\tblref{tab:CombinedCooccurrences}). Looking at the number of aspects
measured together we again see substantial differences in what kind of
scales include the individual aspects. Scales that included cognitions
measured an average of 1.54 other aspects (\textit{SD} = 0.68), scales
measuring behavior, on average, measured 1.48 other aspects (\textit{SD}
= 0.82), while scales that included affect measured an average of 1.97
other experience aspects (\textit{SD} = 0.43) and scales measuring
desires even measured an average of 2.27 other experience aspects
(\textit{SD} = 0.61; also see \fgrref{fig:LiteratureComparison}). Thus,
not a single study measured only motivational acculturation (i.e.,
desires), and measures of desires remained mostly limited to scales that
were already measuring many of the other experience aspects. The results
exacerbate the pattern found in the scale validations, complex measures
and conceptions of acculturation are seen infrequently and external
aspects of cognition and behavior remain the focus of most studies.

\end{figure}

To assess the process focus of the broader empirical works, we again
assessed when in the migration process the data was collected and we
additionally assessed the type analysis done by the authors. We found
that 512 studies (97.71\%) collected data after the arrival of the
migrant in the new society. Two studies targeted potential migrants and
10 studies collected data prior to and following the migration event.
Moreover, only 25 studies included longitudinal data analyses of
psychological acculturation (4.79\%). This observation again underscores
the arguments that the acculturation literature has thus far failed to
provide data that meaningfully captures migration as a process
\citep[e.g.,][]{Brown2011, Ward2019}.

To further assess the comparative utility of the experience framework,
we then assessed differences of experience aspects between academic
fields. For the full results, including differences in the methods, and
publication types as well as contextual differences in terms of sampling
procedures, situational domains, analyses, and cultural contexts see
Supplemental Material B.

We first assessed the references to affect, behavior, cognition, and
desires separately, for each of the disciplines. We find that for all
fields desires (12.5-28.69\% of all measures in the field) and emotions
(35.56-62.3\%) are the least frequently measured elements and medical
journals measure them the least frequently (in proportional terms).
Looking at the common cognitive and behavioral elements the proportions
diverge between the fields. While the multidisciplinary field measured
behaviors (76.47\%) and cognition (82.35\%) almost equally often, in the
medical and general social science journals behaviors were measured
considerably more often than cognitions (\(Behavior_{SoSci}\) = 86.67\%
\textgreater{} \(Cognition_{SoSci}\) = 68.89\%; \(Behavior_{Med}\) =
89.58\% \textgreater{} \(Cognition_{Med}\) = 69.44\%). Inversely, in the
psychological journals cognitions (90.98\%) were measured more often
than behaviors (68.03\%; also see \fgrref[A and B]{fig:FieldPlotFreq}.

When looking at differences in how many different experience aspects
were measured together and patterns within these aspect-combinations,
differences between the fields become increasingly evident (also see
\fgrref[A and C]{fig:FieldPlotFreq}). While `affect, behavior, and
cognition' and `behavior, and cognition' measures are common
combinations across all fields, fewer experience aspects and less
variation were considered in the medical and social science fields.
There were statistically significant mean differences between the fields
in terms of how many experience aspects were considered (parametric:
\textit{F}(3, 409) = 5.02, \textit{p} = 0.002, non-parametric:
\textit{Kruskal-Wallis} \(\chi^{2}\) = 15.01, \textit{df} = 3,
\textit{p} = 0.002, \(\eta_{p}^{2}\) = 0.04, 95\%CI{[}0.01, 1{]}).
Looking at the mean differences in more detail, empirical works
published in psychological journals had significantly higher average
aspect counts (\textit{M} = 2.5, \textit{SD} = 0.83) than the medical
(\textit{M} = 2.1, \textit{SD} = 0.86) and the general social science
journals (\textit{M} = 2.04, \textit{SD} = 0.73; also see
\fgrref{fig:FieldPlotComplexityAverage}). The broader patterns described
here thus point to heterogeneity between fields and show that different
fields diverge in the number and types of acculturation aspects they
tend to consider.

\subsection{Comparing Literature Levels}
\color{black}

As a final step we aim to compare the three levels of literature we have
reviewed (i.e., theoretical-methodological-empirical). We find that all
three bodies of literature focus more readily on the more external
aspects of behaviors and cognitions, and less on more internal affects
and desires. However, we also see that desires (i.e., motivations) play
a more prominent role in the theoretical literature and interest
decreases with more applied research (also see
\fgrref[A]{fig:LiteratureComparison}). Looking at the combinations of
different experience aspects, we find that across all three bodies of
literature a combination of two or three aspects is most common (often
including behaviors or cognitions). However, we also find that single
aspect conceptualizations are substantially more common in the more
applied empirical works, whereas conceptualizations that include all
four experience aspects are substantially more common in the more
abstract theoretical literature (also see
\fgrref[B]{fig:LiteratureComparison}). Yet, we also see that the most
undervalued aspects often are considered in works that have already
included a larger number of other aspects (also see
\fgrref[C]{fig:LiteratureComparison}).
