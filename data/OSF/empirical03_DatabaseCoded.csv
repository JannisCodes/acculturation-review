Aim: The purpose of this study is to analyse acculturation strategies and attitudes in different life domains of native and immigrant adults living in Italy, following the Relative Acculturation Extended Model (RAEM). Methods: The participants were 250 Italian native and 100 immigrant adults who completed a questionnaire with items to measure their acculturation strategies (real plane) and attitudes (ideal plane), in general and related to different life domains (peripheral and central). Results: Results revealed that the acculturation attitude of immigrants is integration, whereas Italians prefer their assimilation. Conclusion: However, when different life domains are taken into account, immigrants claim to put in practice and prefer integration in most of the domains, whereas Italians perceive immigrants are separated but they prefer their assimilation or integration, depending on the specific domain.

Scientific progress in the study of immigrant integration has been hampered by the lack of a common measure of integration, which would allow for the accumulation of knowledge through comparison across studies, countries, and time. To address this fundamental problem, we propose the Immigration Policy Lab (IPL) Integration Index as a pragmatic and multidimensional measure of immigrant integration. The measure, both in the 12-item short form (IPL-12) and the 24-item long form (IPL-24), captures six dimensions of integration: psychological, economic, political, social, linguistic, and navigational. The measure can be used across countries, over time, and across different immigrant groups and can be administered through short questionnaires available in different modes. We report on four surveys we conducted to evaluate the empirical performance of our measure. The tests reveal that the measure distinguishes among immigrant groups with different expected levels of integration and also correlates with well-established predictors of integration.

Each of these studies concerns their sense of purpose, acculturation experiences, and identity development in relation to their educational and occupational achievements, as well as their psychological wellbeing over time. For the qualitative analysis, the participants were interviewed during two different phases of the study. The first set of in-depth individual interviews was conducted in 2007 (Phase 1) with 19 South Sudanese URMs who had resettled in the United States in 2001. From 2014--2015 (Phase 2), 11 of the 19 participants from Phase 1 were interviewed again. Using a modified grounded theory approach, these two sets of qualitative data were analyzed in terms of the participants' purpose development, multidimensional acculturation, identity reformation and integration, educational and occupational achievements, and overall life satisfaction. There are three theoretical frameworks that guide the current research project: a) Damon's purpose-development theory, b) Ferguson's tridimensional acculturation theory, and c) Portes and Zhou's segmented assimilation theory. Based on these three existing theories and their measurements, this study attempts to describe South Sudanese URMs' identified goals, life purposes, major achievements (especially in terms of education and occupation), changes and modifications to their goals, resettlement challenges, social barriers, and how these factors have influenced their long-term adjustment in the U.S. This study's findings reveal the prevalence of an other-oriented/beyond-the-self (BTS) purpose among the South Sudanese URMs that helped them to overcome resettlement challenges and promote positive adjustment and psychological wellbeing. The findings also describe how their process of purpose development was closely related to and influenced by their four-dimensional acculturation experiences, with identity reformation and integration providing insights into their educational and occupational achievements and general life satisfaction as the determinants of long-term adjustment. In the following complementary quantitative study, a questionnaire was developed using existing scales and measurements to evaluate the levels of general purpose and BTS purpose, variables of resettlement challenges such as emotional strain and perceived discrimination, and key adjustment outcomes such as educational and occupational attainment. As a result of multiple regression analyses, the moderation effect of prosocial purpose was found to be statistically significant in promoting better adjustment outcomes by buffering the negative impact of resettlement challenges.

The present study adopts an ecological approach to investigate how refugees perceive the welcoming climate in Germany and the consequences of this perception. To further explore the refugeesâ€™ situation, we examined several predictors of their psychological adjustment and acculturation attitudes. In a field study in Eastern Germany with N = 94 refugees as participants, we assessed the perceived context of reception, and perceived acculturation attitudes as contextual variables, discrimination and contact as intergroup variables and, on the individual level, psychological adjustment as well as the personal acculturation attitudes as dependent variables. The results revealed that more perceived discrimination resulted in an increase in reported psychological problems. Refugees living in asylum centers reported more psychological problems and more perceived discrimination than those living in independent housing. The perceived context of reception positively predicted refugeesâ€™ desire for maintenance of intergroup relations with the host society. Positive intergroup contact lowered their desire for cultural maintenance. In sum, this study gives us rare and valuable insight into refugeesâ€™ perspectives in the context of recent immigration to Germany. In doing so, it emphasizes the importance of a welcoming climate. The study shows how meaningful the assessment of the perceived context of reception is. Practical implications for fields such as the accommodation of refugees are discussed.

Method(s): A cross-sectional study was conducted in Queensland, Australia. A total of 382 first-generation young adult (aged 20â€“39 years) ME migrants completed a self-administered questionnaire. The hypothesised model was tested through a two-step process: measurement, and structural model testing. First, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was applied to test the fit of the measurement model and reliability and validity indices were calculated. Structural Equations Modelling (SEM) was then used to test the structural model. The significance of the mediating effect was tested using bootstrapping method. Results: Mainstream acculturation had the greatest accumulated total effect on PWB through both a direct and an indirect effect via perceived discrimination. Ethnic acculturation had the second greatest total effect on PWB, with both a direct effect and indirect effects through perceived social support and perceived discrimination. Perceived discrimination demonstrated both a direct effect and an indirect effect on PWB through perceived social support. Perceived social support had only a direct effect on PWB. Conclusions: Facilitating ME migrantsâ€™ active participation in both ethnic and mainstream societies is important. Moreover, developing ethnic communities associations and resources could be an effective option to provide social support to ME migrants and in turn to improve their PWB. To provide ME migrants with better mental health outcomes, there is still a need to minimize the discrimination against them.

The purpose of this paper is to contextualize the study of acculturation and adjustment by taking an ecological approach to exploring these relationships across several life domains, using a bilinear scale, and examining mediators of these relationships for adult Vietnamese refugees (N = 203) in the United States. We call this approach the Ecological Acculturation Framework (EAF). Results of a structural equation model (SEM) showed that job satisfaction fully mediated the relationship between American acculturation and psychological distress, demonstrating that this relationship was specific to an occupational domain. However, while Vietnamese acculturation predicted co-ethnic social support satisfaction, it did not predict reduced psychological distress.

Results from a content analysis of open-ended surveys collected from 159 refugees show that the most frequently reported refugee vocational stressor was access and opportunity (31% of comments made about vocational stressors). This meta-theme encompasses feeling as though past work experience is discounted in the job search, struggles with the job search, and exploitation (e.g., low pay). Other meta-themes included acculturative, discrimination, interpersonal, financial and personal vocational stressors. Qualitative accounts of coping revealed reflection and relaxation (25%) and problem-solving actions (24%) as the most commonly reported coping mechanisms. In addition, refugee-specific coping mechanisms (17%) were frequently reported, and referred to building language skills, engaging in assimilation and multicultural activities, and seeking social support from other refugees. Using the meta-themes that emerged in each vocational stressor category, t-test results show that the experience of discrimination stressors was related to higher levels of self-reported anxiety, depression and sleep disturbances. In addition, the use of avoidance-oriented coping mechanisms was associated with maladaptive outcomes, such as depression, sleep disturbances, and anxiety. Taken together, our results indicate that refugees face many of the vocational stressors typically studied in the occupational health literature (e.g., underemployment). The current study also uncovered unique vocational stressors and coping mechanisms, including evidence for a refugee-specific stigma experienced during the job search process and among refugees who are currently employed.

Yet little attention has been paid thus far to the role of acculturation in the context of forced migration. In this study we examined the association between acculturation patterns and mental health symptoms among a convenience sample of Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers (n = 118) who accessed health services at the Physicians for Human Rights Open-Clinic in Israel. Participants completed measures on sociodemographic information as well as detention history, mental health symptoms, exposure to traumatic events, and acculturation pattern, in their native language upon accessing services. Consistent with our predictions, findings showed that acculturation predicted depressive symptoms among asylum seekers beyond the effect of history of detention and reports of experiences of traumatic events. Assimilated compared with integrated asylum seekers reported higher depressive symptoms.

Effect of exposure to the U.S. culture and Western diets and prevalence of chronic diseases were examined. Acculturation was measured using the Iranian Acculturation Scale, and total acculturation score is calculated. Dietary patterns were measured using the Block Brief Food Questionnaire (BFQ), total foods and beverages consumed over the past year, as specified in BBFQ, were studied. Two hundred seven (N = 207) Iranian American immigrants completed the acculturation, food frequency and socio-demographic questionnaires. All participants were born in Iran, were 18 years of age or older and had lived more than one year in the U.S. About 37.5% of participants had acculturation scores indicating Iranian values; the majority (62.5%) had either adapted American values (26.5%) or had combined some American values (36%). Results indicate age at arrival, length of stay, English fluency, education and income are major factors determining level of acculturation, dietary patterns and prevalence of chronic diseases among Iranian American immigrants. Consumption of Western diet and level of acculturation was less among participants who lived longer (> 10 years) in the U.S. and were older when they arrived to the US. The rate of family history of diabetes among participants was 39.1%., though 9% had pre-diabetes and 4% reported being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. A majority of the participants (87%) reported no secondary health concerns related to dietary intake. As Iranian American immigrants grow older their consumption of red meats, fast foods, soft drinks, potatoes, salty snacks, refined grains and sweets were significantly decreased and they consumed more vegetables. Given growing Iranian immigrants in U.S., a deep understanding of factors influencing dietary patterns of Iranian immigrates is necessary. Our study with small sample size (207) has several limitations, which should be rectified by future researchers. Therefore, conclusion about association between level of acculturation, dietary patterns and prevalence of chronic diseases among participants is limited. New Iranian immigrants especially those with school-aged children may become more aware of consumption of Western diet and ill effects on their overall wellbeing.

Immigrantsâ€™ changes and maintenance of their cultures, a process known as acculturation, has been postulated to explain differences in wellbeing. However, the mechanisms by which acculturation impacts wellbeing are not fully understood. This study sought to understand the relation between acculturation and wellbeing through a person-environment fit lens, with the hypothesis that the better immigrants can acculturate in ways they prefer (e.g., taking on the practices, values, and identifications they desire), the better their self-reported wellbeing. An explanatory mixed-method approach was used to examine this hypothesis. Four hundred thirty-eight Latinx immigrants (ages 18â€“77, M = 37.88) who had lived in the United States for less than a year to 55 years (M = 16.75 years) completed survey measures in Arizona, New Mexico, Maryland, and Virginia. A subset (n = 73) participated in 12 focus groups. The sample included naturalized citizens (31.0%) along with authorized (33.2%) and unauthorized (35.8%) immigrants, and matched community immigration patterns. Data were analyzed through path analyses and constructivist grounded theory methods. Results indicated that the better Latinx immigrants could acculturate in the ways they preferred, the better their wellbeing. This relation was explained, in part, through lower levels of acculturative stress. This research suggests that practitioners and policymakers should consider ways to support immigrants to acculturate in the ways they desire as opposed to solely focusing their efforts on particular acculturation strategies.

The Pew Research Center (2017b) reported that in 2015, approximately 11 million of these were undocumented immigrants. Research has suggested that the mental health of Hispanics is indisputably connected to the immigration experience. Counselors predict that the impact of current political and societal disputes surrounding this population is having a detrimental effect on their mental health and, more specifically, their stress level. Clinicians and, therefore, counselor educators are called upon to the psychological needs of ethnic populations such as Hispanics from a framework that addresses cultural values, communication styles, and socioeconomic factors. Therefore, it is imperative that researchers work to provide counselor educators and clinicians with the tools necessary to assess, diagnose, treat, and support Hispanic clients. This study sought to examine how relevant stressors such as documentation status, spiritual coping, and acculturation precede stress and contribute to that literature. The sample in this study included 139 foreign-born adult Hispanics. The sample was recruited from the researchers established network with two local churches and a local health clinic, all with a predominantly Hispanic representation. Participants responded to the survey in person, anonymously. The complete survey included the Abbreviated Version of the Hispanic Stress Inventory for Immigrants, Spiritual Coping Strategies Scale, and the Psychological Acculturation Scale, and a demographic questionnaire, totaling 58 questions. A standard regression analysis was used to analyze the data, which indicated that documentation status, spiritual coping, and acculturation did not contribute to stress levels in the sample. Findings indicated a small correlation between documentation status and stress and no correlation with the other two variables.

This mixed-methods study conducted among Afghan and Iraqi refugee and asylum-seeker psychiatric patients aims to fill this gap. Associations between postmigration stress, symptoms of anxiety and depression disorders, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder were significant. When differentiated for the two groups, associations with postmigration stress were no longer significant for Afghan patients, who were predominantly younger and more often single, lower educated, and without resident status compared with Iraqi patients. Qualitative results indicate that, in addition to psychopathology and postmigration stress, acculturation problems contribute to confusion of cultural identity. The findings suggest that reduction of postmigration stress and acculturation problems may clarify cultural identity and as such may contribute to posttraumatic recovery.

However, among migrants from South Korea, social capital is not linked to their acculturation attitudes, and in general, its role in sociocultural adaptation is lower as compared to the role of acculturation attitudes.

Results showed that an independent self-construal was positively associated with self-awareness and capacity for managing new situations, and was negatively associated with sensitivity to others (which are the three components of autonomyâ€“connectedness). Moreover, an interdependent self-construal was negatively associated with self-awareness and capacity for managing new situations, and was positively associated with sensitivity to others. Importantly, the latter associations were similar for both Dutch natives and immigrants, and the associations between acculturation and autonomyâ€“connectedness were small and nonsignificant.

Moroccan, Pakistani, Ecuadorian, and Romanian immigrants residing in Barcelona nominated 25 individuals (i.e., alters) from their habitual social networks and provided demographic (e.g., ethnicity), relationship type (e.g., family, friend, neighbor), and structural (who knew whom) information for each of these alters. Even after controlling for individual-level demographic and acculturation variables, the content and structure of immigrantsâ€™ personal social networks had unique associations with both types of adjustment and with BII. Specifically, the overall degree of cultural diversity in the network and the amount of Catalan (but not Spanish) 'weak' ties (i.e., acquaintances, colleagues, neighbors) positively predicted these outcomes. Amount of interconnectedness between local coethnic and Catalan/Spanish alters also predicted sociocultural adjustment and BII positively. Finally, against a 'culture and language similarity' hypothesis, Moroccan and Pakistani participants had social networks that were more culturally integrated, relative to Ecuadorians and Romanians. Results from this study attest to the importance of examining actual intercultural relations and going beyond individualsâ€™ reported acculturation preferences to understand immigrantsâ€™ overall adaptation and cultural identity dynamics. Furthermore, results highlight the interplay between interculturalism experienced at the intrapersonal, subjective level (i.e., BII), and at the meso-level (i.e., having culturally diverse networks that also include interethnic ties among alters).

Academic self-efficacy, acculturation, family obligation, and perceived social support have been identified as being relevant to college students' achievement motivation. However, limited research is available regarding the potential impact of these factors on the achievement motivation of undocumented college students (i.e., DREAMers), which is a population with poor college enrollment and retention rates. The primary purpose of this study was to explore the extent to which these factors influenced achievement motivation in documented and undocumented Latinx college students. Participants who identified as documented Latinx college students (N = 160) or DREAMers (N = 84) completed an online survey consisting of a demographic questionnaire, Academic Motivation Scale - College Version, Academic Self-Efficacy Subscale, Short Acculturation Scale for Hispanics, Family Obligation Scale, and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. A series of multiple regression analyses indicated that social support was a significant predictor of extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, and family obligation was a significant predictor of intrinsic motivation in documented students. Acculturation and academic self-efficacy were significant predictors of DREAMers' intrinsic motivation and amotivation, respectively. The implications and limitations of these findings are discussed.

A cross-sectional convenience sample of 324 adult Australian Muslims completed either online or paper-based questionnaires in either English or Arabic. Recruitment was via convenience sampling and social media advertisements. Acculturation, ethnic identity (MEIM), religiosity, and demographic variables were measured. The study sample was young and mostly female, with high religiosity levels. Acculturation was negatively correlated with ethnic identity. From multiple regression analysis, acculturation was predicted independently by religiosity (low), age (young), gender (male) and ethnic identity (low). First generation Australian Muslims were older, had stronger ethnic identity and religiosity, and more commonly self-identified as non-Australian. By contrast second- and third-generation were more likely to self-identify as bicultural or Australian. In summary, acculturation of Australian Muslims is influenced by multiple variables, particularly ethnic identity, religiosity, and generation; hence all these variables need to be included in policy regarding successful integration of migrants.

This study assessed potential mediating factors that may explain these associations among 75 healthy MA adults [age: 37.5 (9.3) y; 65.3% female]. Methods: Secondary data analysis using hierarchical logistic regression examined whether perceived environmental barriers, social support, and intention to exercise potentially mediated relationships between acculturation level, and total and leisure-time moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA). Data were collected via questionnaire. Results: Most participants (67%) reported lower average household monthly incomes ($0â€“$3000), completed some college or obtained a college degree (64.4%), and were first generation immigrants (59%). Acculturation was associated with greater odds of engaging in total MVPA [odds ratio (OR) = 1.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2â€“2.4] and leisure-time MVPA (OR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1â€“1.2). Perceived environmental barriers were associated with greater odds of engaging in both total and leisure-time MVPA (OR = 4.3; 95% CI, 2.1â€“5.8 and OR = 5.5; 95% CI, 2.0â€“7.0, respectively), and social support was associated with greater odds for total MVPA (OR = 3.7; 95% CI, 1.1â€“6.4). Conclusions: Results provide preliminary evidence for mediating factors that may explain the relationship between acculturation level and PA among MA adults. Contradicting prior evidence, results suggest that PA engagement, despite perceived environmental barriers, is possible among MA adults having stronger social support.

Less is known about (a) how acculturation explains differences in family relationships by time in the US, and (b) whether acculturative stressors influence different aspects of immigrantsâ€™ family relationships. Drawing on an expanded acculturation framework, we explore whether and how attitudinal familism, family contact, and family conflict among immigrant Latina/os vary based on acculturation and acculturative stressors. Method: Using nationally representative data on foreign-born Latina/os (National Latino and Asian American Study; N = 1,618), ordered logistic and OLS regression analyses examined whether differences in family relationships by time in the US are explained by acculturation factors, and whether acculturative stressors are associated with family relationships when controlling for other important sociodemographic factors. Results: Accounting for acculturation reduces the effect of time in the US on attitudinal familism and family conflict to nonsignificance. Spanish language proficiency and ethnic identity are associated with higher attitudinal familism, while English proficiency is associated with increased family conflict. Additionally, acculturative stressors (involuntary context of exit, hostile context of reception, limited origin country ties) are associated with lower attitudinal familism and higher conflict. Conclusions: Results highlight the importance of (a) examining the ways that migration influences multiple aspects of family relationships, (b) adopting a more comprehensive acculturation framework.

Methods: The DIVERS study is a prospective cohort study in five urban dialysis centers in the Netherlands. The association of five aspects of acculturation ('Skills', 'Social integration', 'Traditions', 'Values and norms' and 'Loss') and the presence of depressive and anxiety symptoms was determined using linear regression analyses, both univariate and multivariate. Results: A total of 249 immigrant chronic dialysis patients were included in the study. The overall prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 51% and 47%, respectively.

Meanwhile, the high socioeconomic status of some new immigrant groups also challenges the classical assumption that ties to co-ethnic community are associated with deviance. With a sample (n = 960) collected from a population of Chinese students in a large public university in the U.S., we tested how do the interplays between acculturation and co-ethnic ties affect substance use. This study establishes that: (1) different dimensions of acculturation have opposite effects on substance use; (2) acculturative stress does not explain the association between acculturation and substance use; (3) acculturation increases the likelihood of substance use only when one has weak attachment to their co-ethnic community. The findings are consistent for three dependent variables: smoking, drinking, and drunkenness, and for the different constructs of acculturation and co-ethnic ties. Ties to co-ethnic community may provide important social support for immigrants, while acculturation may alleviate the insular subculture that promotes at-risk behaviors. We encourage policy makers to consider the cooperative nature of acculturation and cultural retention for the improvement of health among this growing population.

Vietnamese migrants constitute the largest Southeast Asian migrant group in Germany, yet there is no data on the relationship between the mental health status and acculturation among this population. Aims: Therefore, the present study examines the relationship between two well-established dimensions of acculturation, that is, dominant society immersion (DSI) and ethnic society immersion (ESI), the four resulting acculturation strategies (integration, assimilation, separation and marginalization), and severity of depression. Methods: A sample of N = 113 first-generation Vietnamese outpatients from a psychiatric outpatient clinic for Vietnamese migrants in Germany was studied regarding their self-reported depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)) and acculturation (Stephenson Multigroup Acculturation Scale (SMAS)). Results: Consistent with the hypotheses, patients reported less severe depressive symptoms, when they reported higher orientation toward the German and the Vietnamese society. Moreover, the results showed that integrated patients reported a lower severity of depression compared to marginalized patients, who reported the highest severity of depression. Conclusions: The findings indicate that among a sample of first-generation Vietnamese patients with depression, an orientation to both, the mainstream society and oneâ€™s heritage society might serve as a potential resource. The rejection of any orientation to any society is associated with an increased risk for depression.

The goal of the present article was to determine which model best describes the relation between participating in a new culture and identification with it. In Study 1, Latin American immigrants (N = 146) answered a questionnaire, and the fit of each of the three models was compared using path analyses.

This study utilized a non-experimental, quantitative, correlational method and the sample consisted of 64 participants. They were administered a Demographics Questionnaire, Iranian Acculturation Scale, Relationship Scale Questionnaire, Brief Symptom Inventory-18, and Satisfaction With Life Scale. The data collected was analyzed using a Pearson-moment correlation, multiple regressions, as well as a mediation analysis to determine if level of acculturation is a mediator between attachment and psychological distress. Findings indicated that an individual's attachment style was more predictive of psychological distress than their degree of acculturation but both attachment and acculturation significantly predicted psychological distress and satisfaction with life. Specifically, fearful and preoccupied attachment scores significantly predicted higher report of symptoms and thus lower psychological distress. There was no significant relationship between attachment and acculturation nor between secure attachment and psychological distress.

According to Ward and colleagues, both psychological and sociocultural adaptation change at different rates and extend into later life. For this study, participants 50+ years of age and born in Iran completed questionnaires measuring life satisfaction, depressive symptoms, acculturation, and demographic and sociocultural variables (e.g., pre- and post-immigration occupational status). We collected study data anonymously in Persian to obtain responses from long-term residents of Canada as well as more recent immigrants who may not read or write English. We examined both life satisfaction and (the absence of) depressive symptoms as distinct forms of psychological adaptation; these emerged as independent predictors of acculturation. Contrary to theory, acculturation appears to predict life satisfaction, not vice versa; moreover, there seems to be no direct link between depressive symptoms and acculturation. Our findings suggest that integration within Canadian society is associated with higher life satisfaction. In contrast, sociocultural factors are indirectly associated with life satisfaction (except age) and acculturation (except ethnic diversity of social interactions). Involuntary migrants reported higher levels of depression, whereas loss of occupational status is associated with reduced life satisfaction.

However, little is known about factors that may contribute to their depression. Preliminary evidence suggests that less acculturated individuals are at greater risk for depression but that social support may buffer any negative effects of less acculturation. The aims of this study were to examine the relationship between acculturation and depressive symptoms among Korean immigrants and the moderating role of social support. Methods: A convenience sample of 132 adult Korean immigrants completed 6 self-report measures: the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, a Korean version of the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans-II, the Multi-Dimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, the Perceived Stress Scale, the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status, and a demographic questionnaire. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to examine the aims, controlling for covariates. Results: 31% of the sample met the criteria for being depressed. Greater acculturation was associated with more depressive symptoms while greater social support was a significant predictor of fewer symptoms. Social support was more strongly related to less depression among immigrants who were less acculturated than among immigrants who were more acculturated, but this difference was not significant. Perceived stress was the most significant predictor of depression. Older age at immigration and less education were also related to greater depression. Variables in the regression model accounted for 65% of the variance in predicting depression. Conclusions: Findings indicate a high prevalence of depressive symptoms in this Korean immigrant sample. Results also suggest that acculturation per se may not play a major role in depressive symptoms but rather more specific factors associated with acculturation such as age at immigration and educational levels. These factors should be studied in future research, along with efforts to better understand the causes of stress and impaired social networks in this population. Findings point to a need for regular assessment of depression by health care providers as well as the stress and social support available in a Korean immigrant's life. Results also suggest that community-based prevention programs to address these problems may be warranted.

Results: The majority of the subjects (84.4%) had a clinically significant depression. The extent of depressive symptoms was determined by the selected acculturation style (1) (F = 3.29, p = .025): Subjects with integration as acculturation style showed less depressive symptoms than subjects with assimilation as acculturation style. Furthermore, subjects with segregation as acculturation style also showed less depressive symptoms than subjects with assimilation.

Psychological adjustment and distress were assessed with depression, anxiety, alienation, and life satisfaction. Findings show that premigration traumatic experiences predicted only measures of anxiety. The other measures of adjustment and distress were predicted by postmigration factors, including acculturation and social support. In sum, findings suggest that different psychological outcomes are predicted by different pre- and postmigration factors, suggesting that adjustment is a complex process that involves multiple indicators and dimensions.

Berry (2013) proposed that intercultural relations can be understood on the basis of three hypotheses: the multiculturalism hypothesis, the integration hypothesis, and the contact hypothesis. Our goal was to test these three hypotheses in Russian majority and Asian minority groups. Migrants from Central Asia (N = 168; 88 ethnic Uzbeks and 80 ethnic Tajiks) and ethnic Russians (N = 158) were surveyed using a self-report questionnaire that included measures developed by the Mutual Intercultural Relations in Plural Societies project. Data processing was carried out using Structural Equation Modeling with the Russians and the migrants separately. We found significant and positive relationships between perceived security and multicultural ideology in both groups. We found a positive relationship between intercultural contacts and the integration strategy among the migrants from Central Asia. Intercultural contacts in the group of Russians was positively related to the expectation of integration and negatively related to the expectation of assimilation. The integration strategy of the migrants was positively related to their self-esteem, while the assimilation strategy was positively related to their sociocultural adaptation and life satisfaction. Among the Russians, the integration expectation promoted their better life satisfaction and self-esteem. The multiculturalism hypothesis was partially supported with both the migrants from Central Asia and the Russians: perceived security promoted an acceptance of multicultural ideology but didnâ€™t promote ethnic tolerance. The contact hypothesis was partially supported in both groups: interethnic contacts were positively linked to the integration strategy of the migrants and the integration expectations of the Russians. The integration hypothesis was fully supported in the sample of Russians and partially supported in the sample of migrants. The migrantsâ€™ adoption of the assimilation strategy promoted their life satisfaction and sociocultural adaptation.

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of age and spiritual well-being to acculturation and general health outcomes. The study employed a cross-sectional design and a convenience sampling method. Data was collected from 62 Romanian immigrant adults in the greater Sacramento, California region. The instruments used to collect data were a demographic form, the Spiritual Well-Being Scale, the Stephenson Multigroup Acculturation Scale, and the General Health Questionnaire. All instruments were translated into Romanian, the native language of the participants, by the researcher who is fluent in both English and Romanian. Five hypotheses were developed: (a) Participants who immigrated at a younger age will have higher levels of acculturation, (b) Participants who immigrated at a younger age will report better general health outcomes, (c) Participants with higher levels of spiritual well-being will report better physical and psychological health, (d) Participants who will report higher levels of spiritual will also report higher levels of acculturation, and (e) Orthodox participants will present with lower levels of acculturation. Since all of the variables included in each analysis were categorical, chi-square analyses were conducted to test the research hypothesis. The results of this dissertation supported two of the hypothesis: age at immigration seems to affect the level of acculturation and spiritual well-being seems to affect physical health. The finding which did not support the hypothesis showed that there is no significant relationship between age at immigration and the level of physical and psychological health; spiritual well-being and the level of acculturation, and psychological health; and religious affiliation and the level of acculturation. This study provides additional information that may help explain Romanian immigrants' acculturation experience, spiritual well-being and general health outcomes.

The research was based on data of temporary immigrants (sojourners), being international students who reside in the Netherlands and participants of a Dutch language course (total N = 163). Questionnaires were used to collect data at two time points (time lag: 3 months). Findings from multiple regression analyses reveal that an increase in L2 proficiency is related to a positive change in two indicators of cultural integration: identification with the host society and attitudes towards the host culture. An increase in L2 proficiency appears to be related to a positive change in terms of identification, regardless of sojournersâ€™ personality traits. With respect to attitudes towards the host culture, however, we find that increasing L2 proficiency only goes together with a positive change in attitudes towards the host culture for sojourners with a high degree of social initiative. Another notable finding is that, in the time period that this study was conducted, sojourners with a high degree of openness became more positive in their attitudes towards the host culture, regardless of the progress they made in terms of L2 proficiency. Results from this study cautiously suggest the importance of social perceptual personality traits in the cultural integration of sojourners. In line with this, institutional policies on the L2 learning of sojourners, including the training of social perceptual personality traits, could be recommendable.

In a sample of 349 immigrants living in Germany (199 Turks and 150 North-Africans), we investigated the influence of emotional intelligence (EI) with the Trait-Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS). Acculturation styles were assessed with the Acculturation Attitudes Scale (AAS) as well as specific markers of acculturation behavior. Adjustment was captured by the Satisfaction with life scale (SWLS), the subjective happiness scale (SHS), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) as an inverse marker. Additionally, we assessed perceived unfairness and discrimination. Findings show that EI and its subcomponents are related to beneficial forms of acculturation attitudes and acculturation behavior.

Khalid).] International migration research has focused on the immigrantsâ€™ mental and physical health issues with little attention paid to factors that facilitate adjustment. Recently cross-cultural researchers have tended to focus on certain psychological and social moderators of stress that differentiate between migrants perceiving higher stress and those remaining relatively unscathed. The present study examined the moderating impact of coping resources (sense of coherence and perceived social support) and coping strategies (problem-focused and emotion-focused) on the relationship between acculturative stress and psychological wellbeing (positive functioning and negative health outcomes) in stress-coping model. On a final sample of 308 Pakistani immigrants residing in Greater Toronto Area a series of moderated hierarchical regression analyses were performed separately for positive and negative health outcomes. Results indicated that sense of coherence and perceived social support moderated between acculturative stress and positive functioning (self-acceptance, positive relations with others, autonomy, environmental mastery, purpose in life, personal growth), and acculturative stress and negative health outcomes (depression, psychosomatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia, social dysfunction).The current findings have implications for clinicians, researchers, and policy makers for the identification of resource factors that help to understand the resistant power of growing immigrant population to maintain positive functioning.

We address this concern by examining the links between acculturation preferences, perceived discrimination, and migrantsâ€™ transnational political involvement in their country of origin. In line with collective action research, a cross-sectional questionnaire study (N =84) among Senegalese migrants in Paris (France) and Geneva (Switzerland) examined three pathways to transnational political involvement (motivations and actual behaviour). Perceived discrimination, the grievances pathway, was positively related to both transnational motivations (but only when desire to adopt the receiving culture was low) and political behaviour in Senegal. Desire to adopt the culture of the receiving society as an acculturation preference, the embeddedness pathway, was also positively linked to transnational motivations and political behaviour. Finally, desire to maintain the culture of origin as an acculturation preferenceâ€”the collective identification pathwayâ€”was unrelated to transnational political involvement. These findings underscore the compatibility of transnational political involvement in countries of origin and adaptation to receiving societies.

The role of intergroup contact was also examined, as it is a known predictor of intergroup prejudice. In order to fulfil these goals, we carried out two studies. In Study 1, Spanish participants (N = 279) answered a questionnaire about Moroccans (a devalued group) or Ecuadorians (a valued group) by reporting their acculturation preferences for immigrants, their positive and negative emotions, quantity of contact with them and behavioural tendencies towards them. In Study 2, Moroccans (N = 92) and Ecuadorians (N = 87) assessed Spaniards on these measures. Results confirmed the structure of the new behavioural tendencies scale across four groups of participants. Overall, findings also showed that acculturation preferences and quantity of contact indirectly predicted behavioural tendencies through positive emotions.

Hypothesis 2 was that cultural identity clarity would moderate the association between race-based rejection sensitivity and well-being such that Latino/a immigrants lower in cultural identity clarity would experience poorer well-being than those higher in cultural identity clarity. Method: A community sample of Latino/a immigrants (N = 136; Mage = 38.21; 51.47% female) completed a survey including measures of race-based rejection sensitivity, cultural identity clarity, bicultural stress, self-esteem, and life satisfaction. Results: Correlation and regression analyses revealed that race-based rejection sensitivity was negatively associated with well-being. Additionally, high cultural identity clarity attenuated the negative association between race-based rejection sensitivity and well-being. Conclusion: Results of the present study suggest maintaining clarity over their heritage cultures postimmigration can be beneficial to Latino/a immigrants in Canada, in particular when they are sensitive to cues of racial discrimination.

While each refugee group has its own set of challenges when adjusting to a new country, a better understanding of their needs may help facilitate their transition more quickly with lesser challenges. This study investigated the adjustment of one such groupâ€”Somali Bantus in a Midwestern U.S. city. Specifically, acculturation and school adaptation of Somali Bantu refugee children was explored using the Differentiated Multidimensional Model of Acculturation. Somali Bantu refugee children in 5 elementary schools were asked to complete a questionnaire that assessed their level of acculturation to American culture and level of retention of Somali Bantu culture, at three levels i.e. language, identity, and behavior. The 5 ESL teachers were asked to complete a questionnaire that assessed total difficulties in behaviors for each of their Somali Bantu student. Correlations, MANOVAs, and hierarchical regression analyses were used to analyze the data. The findings of this study documented the significant role of school context in the acculturation and school adaptation of these Somali Bantu refugee children. The findings demonstrated that age was statistically, significantly, and negatively related to overall American Acculturation (AAI) and statistically, significantly, and positively related to Proficiency Level Composite scores. These students' AAI scores were statistically, significantly, and positively related to their Somali Acculturation Index (SAI) scores. Furthermore, SAI scores were statistically, significantly, and positively related to grades on Social Behavior and grades on Social Behavior and Work Study Habits were statistically, significantly, and positively related. Also, age and length of time in the country were statistically, significantly, and positively related. The hierarchical regression analyses for AAI and ABA suggested that the demographic variables age, length of time in the US and gender did not contribute to any significant variance and school contributed a moderate variance to the overall AAI and ABA scores. School contributed substantially more incremental variance to ALA and AIA than did the other variables (age, length of time in the US and gender). Overall, the theoretical model including age, length of time in the US, gender and school explained 18, 25, 17 and 13 percent of the variance in the AAI, ALA, AIA and ABA respectively. The hierarchical regression analyses for SAI, SLA, SIA and SBA suggested that the demographic variables age, length of time in the US and gender contributed marginally significant variance. School contributed substantially more incremental variance to SAI, SLA and SBA and a small incremental variance to SIA than did the other demographic variables. Overall, the theoretical model including age, length of time in the US, gender and school explained 36, 20, 15, and 41 percent of the variance in the SAI, SLA, SIA, and SBA respectively. The hierarchical regression analyses for the school outcomes suggested that the demographic variables age, length of time in the US and gender contributed marginally significant variance in Total Difficulties and Proficiency Level Composite scores but none for Grades on Social behavior and Work Study Habits. School contributed slightly more incremental variance to Total Difficulties and Proficiency Level Composite scores a. Acculturation did not contribute to any significant variance in any of the school outcomes. Overall, the theoretical model including age, length of time in the US, gender, school, and American acculturation explained 26, 18, 16, and 38 percent of the variance and age, length of time in the US, gender, school, and Somali acculturation explained 26, 22, 16, and 41 percent of the variance in the Total Diffiâ€¦ (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2009-99070-498",NA,"ProQuest Information & Learning","Acculturation; acculturation; Refugees; Adaptation; Career Development; Elementary School Teachers; elementary schools; Elementary Schools; school adaptation; Somali Bantu refugee children; teachers; transition",NA,"http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=psyh&AN=2009-99070-498&site=ehost-live&scope=site",FALSE,"P-121",NA,"Sekhon2008","1",1,"quantitative","Acculturation","Language, identity and behavioral acculturation scale",1,1,1,NA,1,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,NA,NA,0,NA,"complex scale","continuous (incl. scale)",NA,"general","acculturation","regression (incl.

Design: A questionnaire consisting of the following sections was submitted to 900 workers in Southern Italy: for individual and cultural characteristics, coping strategies, personality behaviours, and acculturation strategies; for work characteristics, perceived job demands and job resources/rewards; for appraisals, perceived job stress/satisfaction and racial discrimination; for subjective reports of health, psychological disorders and general health. To test the reliability and construct validity of the extracted factors referred to all dimensions involved in the proposed model and logistic regression analyses to evaluate the main effects of the independent variables on the health outcomes were conducted. Results: Principal component analysis (PCA) yielded seven factors for individual and cultural characteristics (emotional/relational coping, objective coping, Type A behaviour, negative affectivity, social inhibition, affirmation/maintenance culture, and search identity/adoption of the host culture); three factors for work characteristics (work demands, intrinsic/extrinsic rewards, and work resources); three factors for appraisals (perceived job satisfaction, perceived job stress, perceived racial discrimination) and three factors for subjective reports of health (interpersonal disorders, anxious-depressive disorders, and general health). Logistic regression analyses showed main effects of specific individual and cultural differences, work characteristics and perceived job satisfaction/stress on the risk of suffering health problems. Conclusion: The suggested model provides a strong framework that illustrates how psychosocial and individual variables can influence occupational health in multi-cultural workplaces.

N.","A study of acculturation in psychotic and non-psychotic immigrants living in Athens",1,NA,"Background: Acculturation is the phenomenon that results when a group with one culture comes into continuous contact with a host culture. Aims: To investigate the correlation between acculturation and psychotic symptomatology in a group of immigrants suffering from psychosis and to explore differences in demographic factors related with the acculturation process between individuals with and without psychosis. Methods: Sixty-five patients and 317 non-psychotic immigrants were interviewed using the Immigrant Acculturation Scale (IAS) and a structured questionnaire for demographic data. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) and the GlÎ¿bal Assessment of Functioning (GAF) were also administered to all immigrants suffering from psychosis. Results: Total IAS scores, as well as IAS everyday life scores, were positively correlated with GAF scores. IAS everyday life score in the patient group related with religion, marital status, gender and years in Greece, while in the non-psychosis group it was related with gender and years in Greece. IAS wishful orientation/nostos (the strong desire for oneâ€™s homeland) related with religion in both groups. The IAS identity in the psychosis group did not show any significant relation with any of the variables, while in the non-patient group, it was related with marital status, gender and years in Greece. Age, duration of residence in Greece and higher adoption of Greek ethnic identity were the variables that differentiated the two groups of immigrants. Conclusion: Acculturation in immigrants suffering from psychosis could be seen as a process that does not correlate strongly with the severity of the symptomatology but is probably influenced by different set of factors.

Factors studied included perceived acculturation expectations of the members of the receiving society, values, cultural identities, general well-being, self-efficacy, cultural knowledge, social networks in the new home country, language proficiency, perceived cultural similarity, support for multicultural ideology and perceived discrimination in the country of origin. In line with the hypotheses, the respondents preferred integration over assimilation, separation and marginalisation strategies. Discriminant analysis was computed to distinguish integrationists, assimilationists and separationists, resulting in two functions that discriminated between the groups. The most important predictors explaining pre-migration acculturation attitudes were the perceptions potential migrants have of future hostsâ€™ preferences for immigrantsâ€™ cultural maintenance and contacts with hosts. In addition, general well-being, Russian identity and support for multicultural ideology significantly predicted acculturation attitudes in the pre-migration stage. The study highlights the importance of acknowledging that acculturation begins already at the pre-migration stage.

Method Questionnaire data were gathered from 169 participants from the Ethiopian, Congolese, and Myanmar communities settled in Brisbane, Australia. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to investigate the factors that predicted employment status. Results Resilience and demographic variables such as age, education, gender, and country of origin were not associated with being employed. Length of stay and English proficiency increased the likelihood of being employed. Surprisingly, an increase in acculturation was associated with the likelihood of being unemployed, while an increase in acculturative stress was associated with the likelihood of being employed. Conclusions These findings indicate that unemployed participants perceived themselves to be acculturated and integrated, while those who were employed reported more acculturative stress.

At present, Germany is close to the middle on the diversity and integration indexes, and below the middle on the policy index. Because of the recent arrival of around one million refugees from West Asia, Germany is an important country to examine and understand views about intercultural relations during this period of transition. The study in this chapter investigates intercultural relations in Germany with two samples from German participants and three other samples with diverse migration backgrounds. Furthermore, we examine how the feelings of well-being of migrants and the majority are related to their feelings of security and intergroup contact. The multiculturalism hypothesis proposes that confidence in one's own identity and place in society leads to the acceptance of culturally different others. In this study, we operationalize confidence in one's own identity and place in society as feeling secure in Germany. For the contact hypothesis, we assess the conditions under which contact is associated with higher levels of acceptance and positive out-group attitudes among minority members. We operationalize 'contact' through the degree of fulfillment of the need to feel connected to Germans. The integration hypothesis proposes that a double engagement with both the culture of origin and the majority society should positively affect the well-being of migrants. We empirically evaluate this hypothesis by assessing two outcomes in relation to the integration strategy: self-esteem and acculturation pursuit.

The present study extends Berzonsky's theorizing to acculturation research and examines the social-cognitive processes underlying identity development of new immigrants (N = 218). We investigate informational (analytical and exploratory), normative (heritage and host) and diffuse-avoidant identity styles as predictors of identity commitment and identity outcomes (self-esteem, self-concept clarity and ethno-cultural identity conflict). Two positive and two negative pathways to identity outcomes were identified, which were fully or partially mediated by identity commitment. Analytical informational style and normative orientation to the host society predicted stronger identity commitment, which, in turn, resulted in more positive identity outcomes. In contrast, diffuse-avoidant and exploratory informational styles exerted negative effects on identity outcomes via identity commitment. Furthermore, identity commitment buffered the negative impact of normative orientation to the country of origin on self-esteem. Taken together our findings indicate that identity commitment plays a central role in identity reconstruction of new immigrants.

Central American immigrants represent a population that is a part of the Latino/Hispanic Diaspora in the United States. By the year 2050 the United States population will experience a great change in the ethnic/racial demographics and most will be former minorities comprising over 45% racial minorities (U.S. Census, 2005). Thus, it becomes more important for counselor educators and other helping professionals to understand how to adequately assess the 'Latino' and be culturally sensitive --- especially since Central American immigrants come from diverse backgrounds, and although they may be labeled 'Hispanic', there is diversity within groups of ethnic minorities. This dissertation examined the research hypotheses: There is a relationship between acculturation level and PTSD among Central American immigrants in the United States. In addition, there are predictive relationships among the demographic variables. The null hypotheses presented are: There is no relationship between acculturation level and PTSD among Central American immigrants in the United States and additionally, there are no predictive relationships among the demographic variables. A Pearson correlation design was done to assess statistical significance (both positive and negative), and to examine if there was a relationship between acculturation level and PTSD. The alpha level was set at a significance level of .05. A standard Multiple Regression design was utilized to assess predictive relationships among the demographic variables with PTSD severity: migration reason, age, gender, migration year, and marital status. The sample of participants was n = 63 out of 100 participants who volunteered to participate in the study. The results show that there was a relationship between acculturation level and PTSD among Central American immigrants. Several instruments were utilized for this dissertation research to assess both acculturation level and prevalence or lack of PTSD severity. The AMAS-ZABB (Abbreviated Multidimensional Acculturation Scale) and the PCL-C (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Civilians) were utilized in this study. The results showed a positive correlation between acculturation level (U.S. identity, r = .289), Latino identity (r = .281), and PTSD. At an alpha level of alpha .01, age was positively correlated (r = .684) and acculturation level (English language) was negatively correlated with PTSD (r = -.465). Multiple R for regression was statistically significant when examining the demographic variables of age, acculturation level (English Language) and migration reason. The results were also statistically significant in predicting PTSD severity.

Methods: A 55-item online survey was assembled by combining three validated instruments for mental health, social support, and acculturation. A link to the survey was e-mailed to training directors of all psychiatric residency and fellowship programs. Directors were requested to forward the survey to their international medical graduate residents for completion between December 2008 and February 2009. Results: One hundred eight international medical graduates from 70 different psychiatric residencies and fellowships completed the entire survey. Respondents' mental health scores were normally distributed. The vast majority scored very high on survey items related to mental health. Acculturation, social support, and postgraduate training year were significant predictors of mental health. Conclusion: Residency training programs should attempt to incorporate measures that would help boost the social support and acculturation of international medical graduates (especially junior-level trainees). Acculturation could be improved by language training and courses in American history, culture, and customs, and social support could be expanded by mentoring relationships.

Among all newlyweds in the United States (U.S.) in 2010, 26% of Hispanics married out (Wang, 2012). Existing literature on society's attitudes towards assimilation and interracial marriage have changed since Latinos began immigrating to the U.S., resulting in positive changes in attitudes and an increase in interracial marriages (George & Yancey, 2003; Lee & Edmonston, 2005; Lee, 2008). There is a small amount of research that specifically focuses on attitudes toward interracial marriage among Latinos, and how acculturation may influence attitudes. The limited amount of research involving the Latino population does not specify the subgroups, or mostly focus on Mexican Americans, which is why this study examined attitudes among South Americans, the new wave of immigrants who have been understudied. The present study focused on providing an understanding on the influence of acculturation on attitudes toward interracial marriage among individuals who identified as Colombian, Ecuadorian, and Peruvian, due to having the highest rate of immigration to the United States (U.S. Census, 2010) among South American countries. Educational level, age, and generational status were also examined to determine their effects on attitudes. The final sample included 130 participants who voluntarily responded to anonymous online questionnaires. All participants completed a Demographic Questionnaire, the Short Acculturation Scale for Hispanics (SASH), and the Attitudes toward Interracial Dating Scale (ATIDS), and three-open ended narrative questions. Quantitative Results from this study showed that there was a significant interaction between generational status and attitudes toward interracial marriage. Education level and age were not correlated with attitudes toward interracial marriage, and the SASH and ATIDS were weakly correlated. Qualitative results displayed that majority of participants held positive attitudes toward interracial marriage. Participant responses revealed overarching themes of: love; values and beliefs; family; personal experience; exposure; and culture and identity, as contributors to attitudes toward interracial marriage. The overall results in this study, displayed support of interracial marriage among the South American population, specifically from Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.

It is a cross-sectional view of 100 non-U.S. born Arab Muslims living in the U.S. Using a non-random convenience sample of individuals from multiple U.S. cities, the study examined the hypotheses that H1: level of perceived discrimination will correlate with level of acculturation in the sample H2: degree of religiosity, degree of ethnic identity, and level of family functioning will mediate the relationship between perceived discrimination and level of acculturation in the sample, H3: controlling for extraneous variables (time spent in Arab world and gender) will account for the relationship between perceived discrimination and level of acculturation. This information was obtained by a socio-demographic questionnaire, the Schedule of Racist Events Modified for Use with Arab American Persons (SRE-AA), the Perceived Religious Discrimination Scale (PRDS), the Vancouver Index of Acculturation- Modified Arab Version (VIA-A), the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure - Revised (MEIM-R), the Family Assessment Device General Functioning subscale (FAD-GF), and the Index of Religiosity (IR). Participants responded to three narrative items. Two VIA-A subscales measured level of acculturation and six variables were both taken together and used separately to measure perceived discrimination (PRDS subscales-Religious; SRE-AA subscales-Racial). Quantitative analysis found a positive association was demonstrated between VIA-A North American subscale scores and the combined subscales measuring perceived discrimination (SRE-AA, PRDS). Also perceived discrimination as measured by the SRE-AA In the Past Year subscale correlated with acculturation as measured by the VIA-A-North American subscale. A negative correlation was also found between VIA-A Cultural Heritage subscale and SRE-AA In U.S. However, none of the variables in H2 mediated these relationships. Gender and number of years spent in the Arab world ultimately did not significantly contribute to the model. Qualitative analysis found several themes associated with discrimination and acculturation in the U.S. For example family integrity is an important factor in the lives of the participants, as is safety, freedom, and seeking out greater opportunities. Participants maintain lives in the U.S. and continue to adapt in their host culture despite perceived discrimination.

Personal views about aging, measured with a subscale of the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale (PGCMS), were regressed on demographic variables, physical health-related factors, and psychosocial attributes (social network and acculturation). Results from the hierarchical regression analysis showed that better physical health conditions (fewer chronic conditions, less functional disability, and better vision) were associated with more positive personal views about aging. Other significant contributors included larger social networks and higher levels of acculturation.

The present research builds on this previous work by investigating the extent to which immigrantsâ€™ independent vs. interdependent problem-solving style moderates the relation between approachâ€“avoidance orientation and social integration. Interdependent problem-solvers rely on other people to achieve their goals. This interdependence was expected to reduce the influence of approachâ€“avoidance orientation on integration amongst immigrants. Immigrants to Australia (N = 137) completed a questionnaire that included measures of approachâ€“avoidance orientation and problem-solving style. Participants also completed three measures of social integration: (1) proportion of Australian friends, (2) feelings of inclusion in Australian society, and (3) satisfaction with employment, accommodation, and life in Australia. Consistent with previous research, there was a positive relation between approach and social integration and a negative relation between avoidance and social integration. Consistent with predictions, problem-solving style moderated the relation for approach orientation: Only immigrants who were independent problem-solvers showed a significant positive relation between approach and social integration. The results are discussed in relation to Gableâ€™s (2006) model of approach and avoidance social goals and motives, and the implications for immigration services are considered.

As hypothesized, results supported indirect links between economic and cultural adaptation stressors and spousesâ€™ marital negativity and satisfaction: (1) contextual stress was associated with depressive symptoms, (2) depressive symptoms were positively associated with marital negativity for both husbands and wives and negatively associated with marital satisfaction for wives only, and (3) marital negativity was inversely associated with marital satisfaction for both spouses. Two partner effects emerged: (a) husbandsâ€™ depressive symptoms were positively associated with wivesâ€™ reports of marital negativity and (b) husbandsâ€™ marital negativity was inversely related to wivesâ€™ marital satisfaction. From these findings, we can infer that the psychological distress that arises for Mexican-origin spouses as they respond to the challenges of making ends meet during difficult economic times while they simultaneously navigate adapting to life in a new country is evidenced in their marital quality. Specifically, this study found that contextual stress external to the marital relationship was transmitted via spousesâ€™ psychological distress and negative marital exchanges to spousesâ€™ marital satisfaction. Wivesâ€™ marital satisfaction was shown to be uniquely vulnerable to their own and their husbandsâ€™ depressive symptoms and marital negativity.

This is particularly true regarding Korean immigrants, an Asian population that is currently immigrating to non-Asian countries in large numbers. Aims: This study investigated how degree of acculturation and adherence to Asian values correlate with psychological distress among Korean immigrants (N = 118) in the United States. Method: Participants from the Midwestern United States (N = 118) completed survey packets including a demographic questionnaire, the Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identity Acculturation Scale, the Asian Values Scale, and the Brief Symptom Inventory 18. Results: A multiple regression analysis revealed that less acculturation, stronger adherence to Asian values, and fewer years of living or being educated in the host country cumulatively predicted heightened psychological distress in this population. However, no single variable alone significantly predicted psychological distress, indicating that additional factors not studied here may influence distress symptoms among Korean immigrants.

Method: Culturally diverse but relatively genetically homogeneous (white Caucasian) patients with schizophrenia (n = 40) treated at a single site were assessed for the presence of ADIMD and level of acculturation. Results: Higher levels of acculturation correlated with an increased prevalence of TD and akathisia but not Parkinsonism. The level of acculturation significantly predicted TD.

Negative Perfectionism significantly predicted more eating disorder symptoms as measured by the EDI. A strong positive evaluation of other ethnic groups together with high Positive Perfectionism predicted lower body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness, whereas the opposite was true for a more negative evaluation of other groups and high Positive Perfectionism. A strong sense of belonging and attachment towards the Chinese culture and valuing other ethnic groups were found to mediate the relationship between Positive Perfectionism and eating disorder symptoms, predicting a lower sense of interpersonal distrust.

Voluntary and forced African migrants and their acculturation preferences in New Zealand",1,NA,"As there is no research on forced migration of African migrants to New Zealand, in particular on the interrelations among psychological motives to migrate and psychological acculturation preferences, the present study aims to address this gap. One hundred and five forced and voluntary African migrants to New Zealand completed a questionnaire, which included two measures (a) the Psychological Motives to Migrate (Tharmaseelan, 2005) and (b) the Psychological Acculturation Index (Mace, 2004). Demographic information, including data on the New Zealand government immigration categories through which the migrant gained entry and length of time in New Zealand, was also collected. Multivariate analyses indicated that motivations to migrate do matter when it comes to acculturation preferences. Further, it was found that psychological motives to migrate were better predictors of acculturation preferences than the government immigration categories. Specifically, voluntary migrants (those motivated by â€˜family life improvementâ€™ and â€˜explorationâ€™) preferred to adapt to New Zealand culture, while forced migrants (those motivated by â€˜escapingâ€™) had a higher preference to maintain their culture of origin. Duration of time in New Zealand was correlated with acculturation preferences. Implications of the findings point to the importance of assessing motivations to migrate from a psychological perspective.

Acculturation has also been linked with stress-related psychological disorder and depression. Aims: This article investigates the acculturation process and the depressive state of foreign immigrants living in the greater Athens area. Methods: All consecutive cases of 157 foreign immigrants who visited a nongovernmental organization (NGO) providing consultative services to immigrants were interviewed using a structured questionnaire including the Immigrant Acculturation Scale (IAS) and the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies--Depression (CES-D) scale. Results: Factor analysis of IAS yielded a three-factor solution and 17 items with loadings ranging from 0.74 to 0.41. This scale was also tested and proven to be reliable. The main finding is that the higher the acculturation level of the immigrant individual, the lower the CES-D scale score; the fewer the depressive symptoms are self-reported. Length of stay, existence of family in Greece, legal status of residence and employment were also found to have an effect on depressive symptomatology. Conclusion: Acculturation could be seen as a beneficial mechanism protecting the individual to be exposed to stressful non-adaptive behaviour.

The dependent variable in this study was acculturative stress while the independent variables included measures of social capital described as constructs based on factor analysis and demographic variables. Five hypotheses were generated, and data was collected from 326 Iraqi Christians residing in Southern Ontario, Canada, who completed a set of questionnaires administrated by the researcher of this study. Three layers of analysis were implemented to test each hypothesis. The first layer tested the predictability of social-capital constructs and the demographic variables on the overall acculturative-stress score. Using logistic regression, an 'Acculturative Stress Main Model' was developed to test the predictability of the social-capital constructs and demographic variables on the overall acculturative-stress score. A binary score was created by splitting the sum of responses to all acculturative stress at the median score. The range of the acculturative-stress sum score was 1 to 100 with a median score of39. This means participants showed a moderate level of acculturative stress. The second layer of the analysis investigated the specific interrelationships between the independent variables and each individual construct of the acculturative stress instrument. This layer of the analysis provided a better understanding of the complex relationships between the dependent and independent variables. For this purpose, six logistic regression models were developed: (1) AS experiencing stereotypes, (2) AS change in values, (3) AS language competencies, (4) AS feeling unappreciated , (5) AS experiencing discrimination, (6) AS identification with country of origin. Each model tested an individual construct of acculturative stress as a dependent variable and against the independent variables of the study (age, education, gender, income, and the six social-capital constructs). A binary score was computed for each acculturative-stress construct, and the distribution was split at the median within each construct. The third layer evaluated each factor from the social-capital instrument and the demographic variables as predictors on the binary outcome for the individual construct of acculturative stress by splitting the sample according to gender to understand the source of stress for each gender. The results of this study in relation to the first, second, fourth, and, fifth hypotheses were consistent with existing social-capital literature on health, which considers social capital as resources that reduce psychological stressors and improve the health and well-being of individuals. In effect, because the participants of this study enjoy social capital, they do not experience high level of acculturative stress. The moderate level of acculturative stress they do experience is due to their interaction with people from the dominant culture. However, the results of this study in relation to the third hypothesis were inconsistent with previous literature. This is one of the few studies that introduces the concept of social capital to the field of social work, considering social capital as a source of social integration and as means of economic success. Social capital is also essential for policy development to support diversity inclusion and social cohesion in a multicultural society.

This research examines the distributions of acculturation attitudes based on his original cultural maintenanceâ€“cultural contact conceptualization and on a later cultural maintenanceâ€“cultural adoption model. In line with the Relative Extended Acculturation Model it also compares the outcomes of real (self-reported behavioral) and ideal (attitudinal) assessments of acculturation. Two hundred and eighty-nine first generation immigrants in New Zealand participated in the study. In line with the hypotheses, integration occurred more frequently when derived from cultural contact than from cultural adoption and when acculturation was framed in attitudinal, rather than behavioral, terms. The findings point to the necessity of clearly defining the dimensions of acculturation, ensuring they are appropriately operationalized, and differentiating attitudinal and self-reported behavioral measures.

Design/methodology/approach: The research employed a survey questionnaire applied to a sample of 210 migrants who had migrated from Sri Lanka to New Zealand. Twenty-three independent and three dependent (career successâ€”objective and subjective) variables were measured. Sequential multiple regression analysis was applied, mirroring the time-sequenced theory of career development. Findings: Overall, migrantsâ€™ occupational status had declined markedly following migration. Variables representing human capital, social integration and career self-management perspectives all contributed substantially to explaining variances in career success, especially objective career success, but motivation to migrate did not. Human capital variables were especially influential in determining pre-migration success, acculturation in the host country and education in the host country in post-migration success. Effects of career self-management behaviors on success were relatively small. Research limitations/implications: A limitation is the cross-sectional design, and possible non-generalisability beyond a single migrant group and host country. Practical implications: The paper discusses implications for migrants, policy makers and future research. Originality/value: Migration, and interest in research on migrantsâ€™ careers, is growing. This paper applies a wide range of predictor variables and a logical causal model to predicting migrant career success, indicates significant effects, and points to positive actions that may be taken by government, organizations and migrants.

Using a phenomenological method, seven adult female Bosnian refugees each participated in an audio-recorded interview lasting from one to two hours. Two major themes emerged from the analyses of the text: belonging and adapting. Belonging included concepts of cultural memory, identity and difference, empathy and reciprocity, and perfection of speech. Adapting focused on coping with transitions, coping with memories of past and attendant losses, coping with accepting a new culture while trying to fit into the new culture, and learning the new language perfectly. Implicit in the refugees' experiences were states of culture shock, loneliness, psychic numbness, grief, nostalgia, and feelings of dejection, humiliation, inferiority, and feeling as if they belonged nowhere. Simultaneously, the refugees reported feelings of relief and safety after leaving behind the threat of death in their old homes, feelings of gratefulness for their new freedom to hope for a better life, and their restored ability to notice beauty, as well as a sense of normalcy in their new lives. Recommendations for nursing research include the need to identify additional factors promoting successful belonging and adapting in refugees.

Results show that with increased acculturation Ss experienced greater stress and depression, which caused a decline in both their grade point averages and in their self-esteem. Those Ss who returned home frequently, communicated with relatives and family, and were late arrivals had high grade point averages and were less acculturated. The early-arrival immigrants (aged 30-35 yrs) were more acculturated, married, and naturalized citizens. They returned home less frequently, lost family ties, and consequently their strong motivation towards achievement. Ss who were married and whose spouses were non-Jamaicans tended to experience more stress because of the dissimilarities in cultures.

The second, 'Immersion within the Host Society' (IHS) also comprises two facets: 'Orientation towards People of French Origin' (OPFO) and 'Orientation towards French Culture' (OFC). The aim was to analyze the relationship between these four facets of sociocultural acculturative orientations and various socio-demographic and psychosocial variables. Two-hundred-and-ten North African immigrants in France answered a questionnaire adapted from Stephenson's Multi group Acculturation Scale (SMAS). Stepwise multiple regression analyses show that OMI is linked to the country of origin and cultural identity, and OCO to satisfaction with life, family situation, sex and cultural identity. OPFO is linked to participation in club activities, and OFC to work/student activity and family situation. These results illustrate the relevance and value of studying immigrants' sociocultural, acculturative orientation on the basis of ISO vs. IHS models, and in the fields of their social relations and their relationship with the culture. They highlight the importance of looking at acculturation as a composite process, the various facets of which are related to different variables that can therefore be regarded as relevant indicators of immigrants' intercultural adaptation.

Design/methodology/approach: The sample consisted of 141 host community (Dutch) and 41 non-western immigrant workers of a postal service company who filled out a questionnaire. Methods of analyses include analysis of variance and multiple regression. Findings: In line with the IAM, results showed that a higher disconcordance in preferred acculturation orientations between host community and immigrant workers related to a poorer quality of intergroup work-relations. However, intergroup contact moderated this relationship differently for host community and immigrant workers. Research limitations/implications: Data are cross-sectional and collected in one organization. Future studies should replicate the findings to other organizational contexts, cultural groups, and collect longitudinal data to determine causal effects. Practical implications: Organizations should monitor disconcordance in acculturation orientations amongst host community and immigrant workers. A multicultural culture in organizations may reduce disconcordance in acculturation orientations between host community and immigrant workers. Originality/value: The paper helps to explain the mixed findings in cultural diversity research so far, by demonstrating that disconcordance in acculturation orientations relates negatively to intergroup work-relations in a multicultural workplace.

The results showed that length of residence in the new culture, immigration status (having resident permits or being 'illegal'), and perceived discrimination were the most powerful predictors of sociocultural adjustment of immigrants. Education, relationships with host nationals and perceived cultural distance were other factors significantly associated with social difficulty in the receiving society. The second purpose of the study was to test the universality of these predictors taking into account the possibility of culture-context interaction. Length of residence, immigration status and perceived discrimination were found to be independent or semi-independent of the context and culture. On the other hand, other variables contributed the explanation of outcomes of adjustment of the ethnocultural groups in their specific context.

Moreover, Ghanaians were assumed to be unfamiliar with the Dutch society and the health care system. A study was conducted using self-report questionnaires to investigate mental health and help-seeking orientation. 81 Ghanians (13â€“48 yrs old) completed self-report questionnaires. Findings show that migration factors, acculturative stress, and legal status have an impact on health status. However, Ghanaians do not report more health problems than the Dutch norm group. The help-seeking orientation of the Ghanaians differs less from the Dutch than was supposed: the Ghanaian Ss consult clergy and traditional healers for their problems as well as the regional ambulatory mental health care center. Satisfaction with the services provided was seen to be quite high. More practical help with regard to financial problems and housing facilities is wanted.

The statistical relations between perceived cultural distance, personality and sociocultural adjustment were much stronger for host domain behavior than for home domain behavior. Adjustment was higher for participants with more cultural empathy, openmindedness and flexibility. Adjustment showed statistically stronger associations with cultural distance than with acculturation orientations.

A total of 120 participants representing three different generational groups (1st, 1.5, 2nd) varying in age, socioeconomic status, and educational level were recruited from the local Korean immigrant population. Participants were seen individually in their homes and instructions and measures were given in the language of the subject's choice (Korean or English). Measures included the Korean Acculturation Scale (KAS), composed of 32-item Acculturation and 8-item Biculturality subscales, a 52-item Relational Family Values Q-Sort (RFVQ), and a 14-item demographic questionnaire. Results indicated that the Korean Acculturation Scale (KAS) had excellent internal consistency and test-retest reliability over a two-week interval. KAS Acculturation and Biculturality Subscale scores were generally found to relate in the expected direction to demographic variables. The RFVQ Q-factor analysis replicated the two-factor solution found by Sung and Wozniak (1999); and on the basis of patterns of factor loadings, three participant groups were identified. (a) Group 1 included those loading positively and significantly only on the Acculturated Korean Family Values factor; (b) Group 2 consisted of those loading positively and significantly on the Traditional Korean Family Values factor and variously on the Acculturated Korean Family Values factor; and (c) Group 3 was composed of those loading positively and significantly on the Acculturated Korean Family Values factor and negatively and significantly on the Traditional Korean Family Values factor. KAS Acculturation Subscale scores were highest for Group 3, followed in order by Groups 1 and 2. Although no statistically significant differences were found for Biculturality Subscale scores, there was a trend for Group 3 to be lowest in Biculturality.

We examined the association between pre-migration and post-migration potentially traumatic events and stressors and mental health, and assessed the moderating effect of post-migration stressors in humanitarian migrants in Australia. Methods: In this study, we used the first wave of data between 2013 and 2014 from the Building a New Life in Australia survey. The survey included 2399 migrants who had arrived in Australia holding a permanent humanitarian visa 3â€“6 months preceding the survey, with 77% and 23% of participants being granted visas through offshore and onshore humanitarian programmes, respectively. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was measured with the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder 8 items (PTSD-8) and severe mental illness was measured with the Kessler Screening Scale for Psychological Distress (K6). Pre-migration potentially traumatic events and post-migration stressors related to asylum process and resettlement were measured with a self-reported questionnaire. Findings: Of the 2399 participants, 762 (31%; 95% CI 29Â·4â€“33Â·2) had PTSD and 394 (16%; 95% CI 14Â·2â€“17Â·2) had severe mental illness. The mean number of pre-migration potentially traumatic events was 2Â·1 (SD 1Â·4). 64%, 59%, 49%, and 18% of participants reported poor social integration, economic problems, worrying about family or friends overseas, and loneliness as post-migration stressors. Pre-migration potentially traumatic events and post-migration stressors were positively associated with PTSD and severe mental illness. Factors significantly modifying the association between pre-migration potentially traumatic events and mental health after controlling for confounding factors were resettlement related stressors, including loneliness (odds ratio 1Â·17, 95% CI 1Â·05â€“1Â·28 for PTSD and 1Â·28, 1Â·16â€“1Â·41 for severe mental illness) and the number of social integration stressors (1Â·10, 1Â·05â€“1Â·16 for PTSD). Interpretation: Our data suggest that post-migration resettlement-related stressors were the most important correlates of mental health in humanitarian migrants, accounting for both direct and indirect associations. Targeting resettlement-related stressors through augmenting psychosocial care programmes and social integration would be a key approach to improve humanitarian migrants' mental health.

The bidimensional 'radex' configuration of acculturation attitudes confirms expected distinctions (a) between integration, separation, assimilation, and marginalization types of acculturation attitudes and (b) between similarly structured own immigrants' attitudes and the expectations attributed to hosts.

The healthy migrant hypothesis and the acculturation hypothesis, stating that the foreign-born and the less acculturated enjoy better health, have been proposed as possible complementary explanations. However, it is not clear which are the socioeconomic, cultural, and personal characteristics that favor good health and that differentiate foreign-born from US-born and unacculturated from acculturated Mexicans. In this paper, we compare, by nativity and acculturation level, the socioeconomic, cultural, and personal characteristics in a sample of low income mostly female Mexican-origin individuals living in Texas and investigate their contribution to differences in self-reported physical health, mental health, and self-rated health (SRH) status. Using a multistage probability sample, we completed 1745 interviews with Mexican-origin individuals. The survey instrument included the SF-12, demographic and socioeconomic information, and questions on social support, religiosity, fear of victimization, trust, perceived racism, and perceived opportunity. Nativity and use of the Spanish language were combined into a nativity/acculturation variable. We estimated multivariate regressions and ordered logit regressions to investigate the association of health outcomes to nativity/acculturation and socioeconomic, cultural, and personal characteristics. Overall, the distribution of strengths (more social support, trust, perceived personal opportunities and less perceived victimization) reflected a nativity-based income gradient and an education gradient reflecting language use. Health outcomes varied by nativity/acculturation after controlling for socioeconomic, cultural, and personal characteristics. Physical health differed by nativity, supporting the healthy migrant hypothesis, while nativity-based differences in mental health were explained by socioeconomic and personal characteristics. SRH varied by language use, suggesting a culturally conditioned response. The socioeconomic, cultural, and personal factors affected health outcomes differently. These findings suggest a complicated interaction between nativity, acculturation, and economic factors in determining social and personal strengths and their influences on health.

Theoretically, it sought to answers questions that help determine how Americanization---the adaptation and acculturation of a visiting culture to absorb and incorporate the host culture into their lives, customs, and social practices, and in this case savings behavior. A comprehensive model was developed to test the idea that living in America can and does have an influence on social and cultural practices. What was of interest in this study was whether or not these same influences could have an impact on particular cultural practices, in this case how people felt about, reacted to, and addressed the concept of savings--the stockpiling of funds for future needs. Information was gathered from a sample of over 500 Saudi Arabian students living in the United States. The model as structured was tested using SEM analytic techniques in an effort to fully explore and expose the nuanced and subtle differences among the respondents. The concept of savings behavior being influenced by Americanization as originally discussed was not substantiated by the model even though some of the indicators were within expected parameters (chi2 = 217.241, p < .001; CFI = 0.839, TLI = 0.732, RMSEA = 0.034). Despite the general problems the overall model revealed that at least 17% of what was termed as savings behavior could be explained by the model. The study still retained its value because it has made inroads into an area that has not yet been explored. Future investigations should take care to find better ways to incorporate some of the cultural elements of savings behavior directly into the instrument based on the perspective of their test populations rather than assume value in and use instruments tested and normed with US samples.

We evaluate whether factors related to the processes of acculturation and enculturation, immigration factors, family stressors and supports, contextual factors, and social status in the US account for differences in 12-month prevalence of psychiatric disorders for eight subgroups of Latinos. We report results that differentiate Latino respondents by country of origin and age at immigration (whether they were US-born or arrived before age 6: In-US-as-Child [IUSC]; or whether they arrived after age 6: later-arrival immigrants [LAI]). After age and gender adjustments, LAI Mexicans and IUSC Cubans reported a significantly lower prevalence of depressive disorders than IUSC Mexicans. Once we adjust for differences in family stressors, contextual factors and social status factors, these differences are no longer significant. The risk for anxiety disorders appears no different for LAI compared to IUSC Latinos, after age and gender adjustments. For substance use disorders, family factors do not offset the elevated risk of early exposure to neighborhood disadvantage, but coming to the US after age 25 does offset it. Family conflict and burden were consistently related to the risk of mood disorders. Our findings suggest that successful adaptation into the US is a multidimensional process that includes maintenance of family harmony, integration in advantageous US neighborhoods, and positive perceptions of social standing. Our results uncover that nativity may be a less important independent risk factor for current psychiatric morbidity than originally thought.

Method: One hundred and thirty five (135) respondents from Romania and Ecuador responded to a questionnaire analyzing mental health by means of the GHQ-12, coupled with other personal, social and psychosocial acculturation variables. Results: Both cultural groups differed significantly regarding the impact of personal and social variables on their well-being. Nevertheless, mental health distress was not explained by their cultural differences but by gender, gross income and perceived discrimination. Social support offered by those still living at home acted as a buffer. Conclusion: It is important to analyze female migration patterns in order to reduce mental health problems, stress the importance of economic income, and examine how social support offered by those living in oneâ€™s home culture is an effective buffer against mental distress.

It investigated dimensions of immigrants' success and explored paths of success of immigrants from different countries of origin. Two main dimensions of immigrantsâ€™ success were outlined: economic success and psychological well-being, when the latter included 'sense of belonging' and 'life satisfaction'. An instrument measuring both dimensions of success was developed. The study was based on data from the 2011 Immigrant Survey completed by a representative sample of the immigrant population in Israel, including 2927 immigrants from the Former Soviet Union, Asia & Africa, Europe & America, and Ethiopia. Structural Equation Modeling were used to generate the model of immigrants' success. The main paths of success were outlined. The path of the low-skilled visible minority contrasted with the path of other, more highly skilled groups of immigrants who resembled the local majority population to a greater degree. Understanding factors shaping the success of immigrants from different countries of origin might be used by policymakers to foster immigrants' economic and psychological well-being.

In addition to the nature of the relationships between the constructs, the ways in which they are experienced by adult English learners were also investigated. Three inventories were adapted for delivery via a multimedia website. The English Language Anxiety Scale (Pappamihiel, 1999) adapted from the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (Horwitz, Horwitz & Cope, 1986) was adapted for measuring anxiety. The Stephenson Multigroup Acculturation Scale (1999) was selected for measuring the degree of acculturation, and the Multidimensional Acculturative Stress Inventory (Rodriguez, Myers, Bingham Mira, Flores, & Garcia-Hernandez, 2002) was selected for measuring acculturative stress. From the ninety-five original surveys that were begun on the website, fifty-five cases were selected for analysis. Results showed no significant correlations between the major constructs; however, interesting correlations among various individual items in the scales existed. Additionally, combined with the analysis of six semi-structured interviews, results indicate that the concept of foreign language classroom anxiety should be moved beyond the perimeter of the classroom for the case of adult immigrants learning English in an English-speaking country. Results further indicate that language acquisition in the adopted country when accompanied by the regular processes of acculturation may produce higher levels of language anxiety, not only in the degree of anxiety but also in the proportion of students dealing with anxiety when speaking English. The construct of language acculturation anxiety is proposed to identify the combined effect of language anxiety, acculturation, and acculturative stress. Implications for the instruction of adult English students are made, as well as recommendations for future studies, including considerations when using a computer mediated delivery with this population.

This study examined tobacco use in association with health beliefs and acculturation status among a convenience sample (N=132) of Arab-Americans over age 18 residing in California. A cross-sectional descriptive correlational design was employed and data collection included the following instruments: the Health Belief Questionnaire; Acculturating Rating Scale for Arab-American-II; Tobacco Use Questionnaire; plus a brief demographic survey. An integrative model of the Health Belief Model and Berry's Acculturation Model guided this study. Results showed that despite the increase in subjects' general health concern, tobacco use was still high. Subjects reported that barriers surrounding tobacco cessation were greater than the benefits of quitting, and those with lower levels of acculturation had higher levels of tobacco use regardless of duration of residency. The data supported the hypothesis that culture plays an important role in smoking behavior and health motivation. The Arab culture emphasizes both fatalism and reliance on God's will, but disease prevention programs in the US emphasize the individual's role in health promotion. Thus, culturally-sensitive tobacco cessation programs should be tailored to meet the needs of this high risk population.

Correlation and regression analyses were performed to identify the effects of the predictor variables on marital satisfaction. The results revealed statistically significant predictive power attributable to the independent variables over and above demographic variables. The results also showed that spirituality has a unique influence on marital satisfaction whereas psychopathology negatively contributed to marital satisfaction. Another important finding of this study is that positive emotions, identified by the VPI subscale Sattva, are associated with decreased psychopathology. Similarly, negative emotions, identified by the subscale of Tamas, are positively associated with increased psychopathology.

A concurrent mixed-method nested, quantitative dominant design was employed. A comparison between actual and perceived sibling acculturation discrepancy was also examined as well as differences between Vietnamese and Chinese young adults on the key study variables. Thematic analysis of the qualitative data was conducted to further shed light on the quantitative findings. Two samples were collected: the main data set comprised of 150 Vietnamese and Chinese young adults and the sibling pairs data set comprised of 18 pairs of siblings. Questionnaires on self-reported and perceived bilinear acculturation, sibling relationship quality, psychological adjustment, intercultural adjustment difficulties and demographic data were administered online. Qualitative data was collected using eight open-ended questions regarding sibling acculturation discrepancy and sibling relations. Quantitative results showed that sibling acculturation discrepancy uncorrelated with psychological adjustment or intercultural adjustment difficulties. Further, sibling conflict moderated the relationship between perceived sibling heritage acculturation discrepancy and intercultural competence difficulties and predicted psychological adjustment. Analyses also revealed that siblings accurately perceived acculturation discrepancies. Further, actual and perceived acculturation discrepancy were both associated with psychological adjustment and intercultural competence difficulties. Finally, Chinese young adults were more likely to report higher heritage acculturation and sibling warmth than Vietnamese young adults. Qualitative results revealed seven themes of which three were related to the quantitative results. First, siblings defined acculturation in both multi-factorial and bilinear terms. A multi-factorial and bilinear approach to acculturation measurement may have enhanced the present study. In addition, siblings were aware of differences in acculturation between themselves, but they employed many strategies to cope with perceived acculturation differences to help mitigate sibling conflict and distress. The association between sibling conflict and psychological adjustment found in this study may be related to the way siblings cope with acculturation differences. This study expands upon the acculturation gap-distress model to include siblings as an important context within which to study immigrant adjustment and adaptation. The implications of its findings are discussed.

This project was an effort to expand our understanding of the impact of acculturation in the workplace and on workplace practices, particularly on the rapidly growing number of diversity programs. A sample of 150 Armenian immigrants (8 Assimilated, 32 Separated, and 109 Bicultural Armenians) living in the United States of America participated in this study. The participants completed a series of questionnaires including: (1) a reward allocation questionnaire which measured reward distribution preferences, (2) the Pan-Acculturation Scale (Soriano, 1999) which identified participants' acculturation type, (3) the Values Scale (Singelis et al., 1995) which assessed the participants' cultural patterns in terms of vertical and horizontal individualism and collectivism, (4) the Group Characteristics Questionnaire (Ferdman & Horenczyk, 2000) which determined the strength of ethnic identity with respect to the Armenian and American cultures, and (5) a demographic questionnaire. The hypotheses concerning participants' choice of equity-based or equality-based allocation style varying based on acculturation type was not supported. Essentially, Assimilated, Separated, and Bicultural Armenian immigrants did not demonstrate a significant difference in preferences for reward allocations. The hypotheses concerning the interaction between type of acculturation and workgroup ethnic composition in preferences for reward allocations was also not supported in that Bicultural Armenian immigrants did not differ in their reward allocation preferences based on the workgroup ethnic composition. An unexpected finding in the data set was that Separated and Bicultural respondents preferred the Horizontal Individualism (HI) cultural pattern whereas the Assimilated respondents preferred the Horizontal Collectivism (HC) cultural pattern. The results of this empirical research show preliminary evidence of within-group differences among Armenian immigrants. The results demonstrated that the Vertical Individualism cultural value is significantly related to preferences for equity over equality (r = .31, p < .000). This is an important contribution to cross-cultural psychological literature in that it establishes a connection between cultural values and preferences in reward allocations. In addition, this finding is an important one for employers to take note of. In order to maximize motivating factors, employers must ensure that the rewards will lead to the desired results. To this end, employers must be open to researching and identifying what motivates their employees by diversifying the types of rewards and the manners in which they are distributed.

The migrant pathway from Australasia to the UK is well established. Moreover, rugby league is a sport in which debate concerning the merits of employing labour migrants from Australasia is prevalent and ongoing. The study used interview and questionnaire data to investigate the embodied experiences facing this group of migrant professionals. Migrant experiences prior to migrating were contoured by access to resources and by the formal and informal relationships developed through professional and personal careers. The embodied and complex nature of contractual negotiations is highlighted. The centrality of embodied migrant identity and habitus is noted in relation to acculturation strategies adopted over time and space, both prior to and during a foreign sojourn, in terms of established and outsider groups. The paper also highlights how subgroups within a more general group of labour migrants can emerge. Furthermore, the complex influence of personal and professional relationships was found to be both enabling and constraining. These differences between subgroups are considered in light of previous work on acculturation strategies and the existential nature of migration.

The paper begins by describing the current cultural and immigrant diversity in Russia, and then provides a short description of Russian immigrants and the social and psychological problems that immigrants and the larger society face. We present the conceptual framework and findings from empirical studies that examine the reciprocal acculturation and intercultural relations between migrants and members of the larger society. We analyze these studies with respect to their relevance to three hypotheses that have been advanced for examining intercultural relations: the multiculturalism hypothesis; the integration hypothesis; and contact hypothesis. Findings of the studies showed that measures of security, identity, perceived threat/discrimination have a significant relationship with ethnic tolerance, mutual attitudes, acculturation strategies and expectations, and the well-being and life satisfaction of both immigrants and members of the larger society. The results of these studies support all three hypotheses in both groups. The authors concluded that the efforts to improve relations between members of the larger society and immigrants should be directed at enhancing the basic sense of security and at developing programs that increase multicultural attitudes, ethno-cultural competence, and tolerance between both groups.

A sample of 297 first generation immigrants was obtained, who were presented with Bartholomew's Relationship Scale Questionnaire (RSQ), the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and the Indonesian Acculturation Rating Scales (IARS), an Indonesian adaptation of the scales used by Cuellar and colleagues to research the acculturation patterns of Mexican-Americans. As hypothesized, secure persons generally demonstrated higher levels of adjustment as indicated by scores on the SCL-90 and the SWLS. Specifically, compared to persons whose attachment style categorizes them as secure, fearful and preoccupied persons reported higher indications of hostility, interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety, depression, and psychosomaticism, and lower levels of satisfaction with life. Compared to dismissive-avoidant persons, fearful and preoccupied persons reported only higher hostility and interpersonal sensitivity. No significant differences were found between secure and dismissive persons or between preoccupied and fearful persons. In exploratory analyses, the results show that the acculturative behavior pattern of immigrants parallels prototypical adult or even infant attachment relationships. In the context of cultural change, compared to those with other styles, persons with secure attachment are the most successful at adapting to acculturative stressors and integrating their own culture with another. Preoccupied persons generally fell between the two extremes of dismissively and securely attached people, with secure persons being more acculturated and oriented toward American culture. Unexpectedly, no significant differences were found between fearful and all styles combined. In terms of marginality, the acculturation attitude patterns follow Bartholomew's four-category typology. Securely attached persons have less difficulty relating to both their own and other cultures. Preoccupied persons tend to have less difficulty relating to their own culture, but are marginalized toward other culture. Dismissively attached people tend to have difficulty relating to own culture but not to other cultures. Fearfully attached persons reported difficulties relating to all cultures. Stress and satisfaction with life both mediated significantly the relationship between preoccupied and marginality, but not with other attachment styles. Findings are discussed in terms of attachment working models, and implications for future research and ministry to this immigrant population are explored.

Using data from a large dual frame sample of first generation Mandarin speaking Chinese immigrants in metropolitan Los Angeles counties with the largest groups of Chinese immigrants, this study uses a path analytic approach to trace how predictors are related to depressive symptoms and to measure direct and indirect influences of variables. Although bivariate analyses suggested that many predictors were associated with depressive symptoms, multivariate path analysis revealed a more complex structure of mediated associations. In the multivariate path analysis only reports of physical health and immigrant stress were directly related to depressive symptoms (P < 0.05), while acculturation, time in the US, income, US citizenship, and distance of persons on whom one could rely were related to stress (but not to physical health status) and only to depressive symptoms as mediated by stress. Age and educational attainment were related to health status (and to stress as mediated by physical health) and to depressive symptoms as mediated by both health and stress. These variables were also unrelated directly to health status and to depressive symptoms. Associations were evaluated using statistical significance, P < 0.05. This study demonstrates the significance of stress and health as mediators of variables in the larger context of the physical environment and suggests that the mechanisms linking ecological characteristics of immigrants to depressive symptoms may be stress and physical health among immigrants.

These hypotheses were derived from the Canadian multiculturalism policy (Berry, 1984), and their validity has been assessed in a number of countries. Our goal was to evaluate these hypotheses in Russia (Moscow) and Latvia (Riga). We used sociopsychological surveys of two dominant groups (Russian Muscovites and Latvians in Riga) and two nondominant groups (migrants from the Caucasus in Moscow and the Russian minority in Riga) employing structural equation modeling. A sense of perceived security promoted tolerance toward other cultural groups in three of the samples. Perceived security was related significantly to multicultural ideology in Riga, but there was no significant relationship to multicultural ideology in the Moscow samples. A preference for the integration strategy among the migrants in Moscow as well as among the Russians in Latvia promoted their better sociocultural adaptation and had a significant impact on the life satisfaction of the Muscovites but had no impact on the Latvian sample in Riga. Our results provided some support for the effect of intercultural contact on the acceptance of others in three of the groups: the migrants in Moscow, the Russian minority in Riga, and the dominant group in Moscow. However, among the Russians in Riga, the relationship between contacts and perceived security was negative. The multiculturalism hypothesis was confirmed with the dominant group in Riga and was partly confirmed with both the dominant and the nondominant groups in Moscow and with the Russian minority in Riga. The contact hypothesis received partial support with both groups in Moscow and the Russian minority in Riga but was not confirmed with the Latvians in Riga. There was partial support for the role of the integration strategy in promoting sociocultural adaptation and well-being among the migrants in Moscow and the Muscovites. These findings require additional analysis of the sociopolitical and historical context in Latvia in order to understand the psychological outcomes of acculturation among the Russian minority there.

Results: The results indicate that mental ill health among immigrants is independently associated with non-immigrant-specific factors (i.e. high number of types of traumatic episodes, divorced/widowed, poor social network, economic insecurity and being female) and immigrant-specific factors (i.e. low level of sociocultural adaptation). These results were obtained regardless of whether mental ill health was operationalized as low subjective well-being or a high symptom level of anxiety/depression. Conclusions: These findings support the notion that mental ill health among immigrants is a multi-faceted phenomenon that needs to be tackled within a wide range of sectorsâ€”e.g. the healthcare system, the social service sector and, of course, the political arena.

It is motivated by the conundrum between these migrants' high pre-migration human capital and their lower-than-expected post-migration socioeconomic status in the U.S. Angled at the intersection of race and migration, this research is informed by four major bodies of theoryâ€”international migration theory, theories on racial hierarchy and race relations, contemporary assimilation theory, and social network theory. This research has a two-fold agenda: (1) to uncover how race/ethnicity and social class accommodate or obstruct the migration and assimilation of African immigrants and (2) to clarify how social networks in various contexts facilitate or constrain the assimilation of African-horn migrants in the U.S. This research employs an extended case method approach which is suitable for research that aims to reconstruct existing theory. The instruments include a survey on background information, in-depth interviews on migration history and adaptation process, survey instruments for network analysis, and 'shadowing' observations with Ghanaian and Nigerian immigrants residing in Maryland. A snowball sampling technique was used to recruit participants that vary by individual and contextual characteristics through school, work, and neighborhood-based associations, voluntary organizations, and field contacts. I find that Ghanaians and Nigerians migrate to the United States in pursuit of educational and occupational opportunity in a politically stable society. They use their human-cultural, social, and financial capital to acquire a vast array of visas in pursuit of the American Dream. However, their ability to successfully integrate into American society is circumscribed by their immigration status, race, gender, and class backgrounds as illustrated by their migration processes, educational experiences, workforce trajectories, and social integration patterns in the United States. While I st generation immigrants exhibit varying degrees of success, their determination and selective acculturation strategiesâ€”mainstream economic integration coupled with selective cultural assimilationâ€”pave the way for subsequent cohorts and generations of Ghanaian and Nigerian immigrants to enjoy upward mobility in American society. These findings establish assimilation as a multigenerational process circumscribed by societal structure but also negotiated through immigrant agency.

It is presented as a six-stage progression model with universal application. Experiments using Rest's Defining Issues Test (DIT) that measures stages in the model have not shown subjects coming from non-western cultures as scoring as high as subjects from western cultures, especially at the model's 'postconventional' level (stages five and six). This study assessed the level of acculturation of minority, college (or equivalent) educated immigrants from non-western cultures, now living in the USA, to determine the relationship between their levels of acculturation and the principled moral reasoning they manifest. The study hypothesized that immigrants with higher scores on the dominant society immersion scale were likely to produce higher levels of principled moral reasoning as defined by the Defining Issues Test and also, that conversely, immigrants with higher scores on the ethnic society immersion scale were likely to obtain lower levels of principled moral reasoning. Two psychological questionnaires were administered. The Stephenson Multigroup Acculturation Scale (SMAS) measured levels of acculturation. The SMAS provided two scores, namely, dominant society immersion score, and ethnic society immersion score. The Defining Issues Test determined the postconventional principled moral reasoning currently held by the subjects (expressed as their P scores). The analysis resulted in a significant positive correlation between the P score and the dominant society immersion. This shows that those with higher levels of principled moral reasoning are likely to get higher scores on the dominant society immersion scale. Conversely, those with higher levels of principled moral reasoning were more likely to obtain lower scores on the ethnic society immersion scale. The finding brings into question the concept of universality in Kohlberg's theory of moral development.

More sophisticated and comprehensive research designs have been sought to illuminate the complexity of the relationship. In response, the present study attempted to examine the relationship between acculturation/enculturation and subjective well-being (SWB) by including social connectedness and its importance as a mediator and a moderator, respectively. One hundred eighty-eight Korean immigrants residing in two Midwestern metropolitan areas participated in this study. A survey questionnaire method was used for data collection. Structural equation modeling and hierarchical multiple regression analysis were used for mediation and moderation tests, respectively. The influence of acculturation was found to be partially mediated to SWB via social connectedness both in mainstream society and in the ethnic community. The influence of enculturation was found to be fully mediated to SWB via social connectedness in the ethnic community. In support of SWB theories of goal approaches and value-as-a moderator model, importance of social connectedness in mainstream society was found to moderate the relationship between social connectedness in mainstream society and positive affect. Importance of social connectedness in the ethnic community also was found to moderate the relationship between social connectedness in the ethnic community and positive affect.

Method: We used Smithâ€™s (2003) theory of religious effects and Baron and Kennyâ€™s (1986) approach for mediation analysis to explain the mediating role of social support between DSE and depression. The sample consisted of 200 elderly Korean immigrants who were aged 65 or older (mean age = 72.5, range = 65â€“89) living in the New York City Metropolitan area. Hierarchical regression model was used with SPSS version 17.0 to analyze cross-sectional data. Results: Elderly Korean immigrants in the present sample were found to be moderately engaged in DSE but not experiencing a fair level of social support. Respondents reported no depression on the average but 30% of them (60 out of 200 respondents) were experiencing mild to severe depression. Both DSE and social support were inversely related with depression, and the relationship between DSE and depression was mediated by social support. Conclusion: These findings are only suggestive and should not be generalized to a larger population. However, this study supports the importance of DSE and social support in the life of elderly Korean immigrants as a way to alleviate depression. Mental health professionals may consider facilitating social network when elderly Korean immigrants suffer from depression.

The findings reveal a gap between these individualsâ€™ changing sexual behaviours and the continuing silence on sex. Although Canada has exposed them to a new living environment that has shaped the dynamics and patterns of their sexual practices, their incomplete integration into the host society and their close connections with China as the home country mean that traditional Chinese norms continue to influence their understanding of these changes. With the increasing openness of these immigrantsâ€™ sexual relationships, the obsolescence of their consciousness and knowledge of sexuality should be addressed in order to reduce their vulnerability to sexual inequalities and consequent health risks.

In addition, it also examined the relationship between demographic factors and adjustment and compared the predictive value of attachment styles and demographic factors for immigrants' adjustment. The Attachment Style Questionnaire was used to assess respondents' attachment. Psychological adjustment was measured with the Psychological Health Scale and the Satisfaction With Life Scale. Sociocultural adjustment was measured with the Social Support Listâ€”Interactions scale. Two scales for measuring identification and contact with the native and with the Dutch culture were developed and used as indicators of cultural adjustment. We found relations between attachment styles and psychological and sociocultural adjustment. Secure attachment was positively related (p < .01) to psychological and sociocultural adjustment, fearful attachment was negatively (p < .01) associated with psychological adjustment, and more negatively with identification with the Dutch culture than with identification with the native culture. Preoccupied attachment was negatively related (p < .01) to psychological adjustment and to identification with the Dutch culture. Dismissing attachment was weakly negatively related (p < .01) to sociocultural adjustment. Correlation patterns across the three immigrants' samples indicate that dismissing individuals remain relatively indifferent towards their native and the Dutch culture. Regarding demographic factors we found that education and age at immigration were positively associated with psychological and sociocultural adjustment, and length of residence appeared to be positively related to sociocultural adjustment. In general, demographic factors showed a stronger association with sociocultural than with psychological adjustment. Regression analysis revealed that attachment styles were better predictors of immigrants' psychological and sociocultural adjustment than demographic factorsâ€”education, age at immigration, and length of residence. The results indicate that immigrant studies would benefit from taking an attachment perspective.

In a survey of Latino immigrants in the United States, it was found that perceived group-based rejection from Latinos was related to lower ethnic identification and stronger identification with the United States and marginally stronger bicultural identification as Latino-American. Perceived group-based rejection from other Americans was related to stronger disidentification with the United States, but had no relationship to ethnic identification.

Being female (OR = 2.41) and PA levels (OR = 2.62) were significantly associated with diet. Being female (OR = 3.24), more educated (OR = 3.73), U.S.-born (OR = 2.84), and receiving diabetes education (OR = 3.67) were associated with PA. Diabetes education (OR = 2.41) was associated with glucose monitoring. Although acculturation influenced only PA and no other behaviors, personal and cultural factors require further investigation to design diabetes management strategies for Hispanic seniors at the border region.

In addition, studies have shown that acculturation may increase levels of perceived discrimination among foreign-born Mexicans living in the U.S. The primary purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between perceived racism and ambulatory blood pressure among a convenience sample of 332 foreign-born Mexicans living in Utah County, Utah controlling for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and acculturation. This was done through the use of several multiple regression analyses using archival data collected at Brigham Young University. The Perceived Ethnic Discrimination Questionnaireâ€”Community Version (Brief PEDQâ€”CV) was used to measure perceived racism. The Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans (ARSMA-II) was used to measure both language and general acculturation. Four blood pressure variables, including waking systolic blood pressure (WSBP), waking diastolic blood pressure (WDBP), sleeping systolic blood pressure (SSBP), and sleeping diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) were used as outcome variables in the regression analyses. A relationship between perceived racism and any of the ambulatory blood pressure variables used in this study was not found. In addition, English-language acculturation was not found to moderate the relationship between perceived racism and blood pressure in the sample of first generation Mexicans participating in this study. A moderating effect of general acculturation on the relationship between perceived racism and blood pressure was found when controlling for age, BMI, and gender, though this moderating effect disappeared when WDBP was included in the regression model. Implications of findings, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed.

Females were more prone to eating concerns and these were positively related to symptoms of psychological distress. Acculturation, self-construal, ethnic identity and psychological functioning were not related to desire to be thinner, feeling guilt after eating, fear of being overweight nor preoccupation with the thought of having fat on one's body. Collective self-esteem and symptoms of psychological distress were positively related to feeling discomfort after eating sweets, while interdependent self-construal and assimilation were negatively related. Culturally relevant variables, namely acculturation, self-construal and ethnic identity, were related to only certain facets of eating concerns.

Method: A two-part research strategy using both quantitative and qualitative methods was employed. In the cross-sectional quantitative survey, 113 Chinese respondents completed a questionnaire investigating demographic factors, life experiences associated with migration, proficiency in the English language and mental health status. In the qualitative phase of the research, interviews were conducted with a further 24 immigrants to explore these factors in more depth. Results: In the questionnaire survey, over 60% of the group reported symptoms of poor mental health. Qualitative research shows that for those who were employed in catering, psychological adjustment was heavily dependent on strong ties with the Chinese community and there was minimal contact with the host society. By contrast, those concerned with professional development experienced conflict as a result of a high perceived need for integration and a recognition of the problems associated with this. Conclusion: The psychological distress experienced by immigrants of Chinese origin continues to be a largely invisible cause for concern.

According to the assimilation hypothesis, Turkish immigrants to the U.S. should become more individualistic with increasing length of stay. Alternatively, the immigrant interdependence hypothesis proposes that the exigencies of immigration require retaining or increasing collectivist values and behaviors, especially the willingness to rely on others. Measures of individualism and collectivism were obtained from Turkish immigrants to the U.S., Turks residing in Istanbul, and residents of Boston. Bostonians and Istanbul residents differed primarily on vertical collectivism, which is the tendency to subordinate ones own goals to those of in-group authority figures. Immigrantsâ€™ values did not change with increasing length of stay in the U.S., refuting the assimilation hypothesis. When immigrants were compared to non-immigrants, immigrants endorsed stronger horizontal and vertical collectivism and more desire to both give and receive, consistent with the immigrant interdependence hypothesis. However, this hypothesis was not uniformly supported. Compared to non-immigrants, immigrants reported more self-reliance with competition, and more internal locus of control, indicating a sense of agency and responsibility. Findings are consistent with the view that immigrants adjust in complex ways to their new society, and may have different temperaments than non-immigrants.

Therefore, the present quantitative study investigated the variance in attitudes toward seeking psychological help as predicted by degree of acculturation, severity of self-reported problems, and beliefs about the cause of mental health problems among West African immigrants in the U.S. The following research questions and hypothesis were addressed: What are the specific mental and physical health concerns of West African immigrants in the U.S.? Where do West African immigrants with mental health problems seek help? The hypothesis was that higher acculturation into the U.S. society, severity of self-reported problems, and interactional attribution beliefs about mental health problems would be significant predictors of attitudes toward seeking psychological help. Approximately 600 questionnaires were mailed to first generation West African immigrants. A total of 126 surveys were received representing a return rate of 21%. Of this number 15 were not usable. Analyses were based on the remaining 111 surveys. Each survey packet included a demographic questionnaire, a referral list for national mental health, counseling and crisis services, a business reply envelope, and a battery of 4 instruments including the Attitude Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help Scale (ATSPPH), Behavioral Acculturation Scale (BAS), Brief Symptoms Inventory (BSI), and the Mental Health Locus of Origin Scale (MHLO). Descriptive statistics were computed (percentages & frequencies) to answer the first and second research questions. In addition, one multiple regression, using forced entry method was performed to predict West African immigrantsâ€˜ attitudes toward seeking psychological help as measured by the total scores on the ATSPPH, using the BAS, BSI, and MHLO scores as predictors. Finally, Pearson product moment correlation analyses were performed among the variables in examining the regression results. The results identified interactional attribution beliefs about mental health problems as the only significant predictor. West African immigrants reported various concerns with their mental and physical health. In general, they reported preference for the use of informal systems of support to resolve their emotional concerns and the use of medical doctors for physical concerns.

The present study examined the sociocultural adjustment of sojourning Malaysian students in Britain. Eighty-one Malay and 110 Chinese students enrolled in various courses answered a self-report questionnaire that examined various aspects of sociocultural adjustment. A series of one-way analyses of variance showed that Malay participants experienced poorer sociocultural adjustment in comparison with their Chinese counterparts. They were also less likely than Chinese students to have contact with co-nationals and host nationals, more likely to perceive their actual experience in Britain as worse than they had expected, and more likely to perceive greater cultural distance and greater discrimination. The results of regression analyses showed that, for Malay participants, perceived discrimination accounted for the greatest proportion of variance in sociocultural adjustment (73%), followed by English language proficiency (10%) and contact with host nationals (4%). For Chinese participants, English language proficiency was the strongest predictor of sociocultural adjustment (54%), followed by expectations of life in Britain (18%) and contact with host nationals (3%). By contrast, participants' sex, age, and length of residence failed to emerge as significant predictors for either ethnic group. Possible explanations for this pattern of findings are discussed, including the effects of Islamophobia on Malay-Muslims in Britain, possible socioeconomic differences between Malay and Chinese students, and personality differences between the two ethnic groups. The results are further discussed in relation to practical steps that can be taken to improve the sociocultural adjustment of sojourning students in Britain.

Findings support the contention that adaptation is multifaceted. Consistent with stress and coping models, psychological adaptation was associated with the personality variable of hardiness, social support, acculturation attitudes, and discrimination. However, in line with social learning perspectives, sociocultural adaptation was mostly related to variables instrumental in acquiring social skills in the new culture, namely, language proficiency and contact with members of the dominant group. Marital adaptation was mostly associated with marital stressors and marital support. The lack of research on gender differences in the differentiation of adaptation was addressed. The effects of socioeconomic status and gender have also been examined.

Depression among Korean immigrants was hypothesized to be associated with socio-demographic and cultural factors, including health status, gender, education, financial status, acculturation level, familism, social support, especially from the family, and family relationships. A face-to-face interview was conducted in Korean using a structured questionnaire. Depression in this study was measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies of Depression (CES-D) Scale. A substantial percentage of the sample was experiencing a high level of depression. The mean score on the CES-D scale was 15.1, slightly below 16, a cut-off score for clinical depression, and almost 40% of the respondents scored 16 or above on the scale, indicating a high rate of clinical depression for the study sample. In multiple regression analyses, perceived health status and education were significant predictors among socio-demographic factors. Among cultural factors, acculturation status was not a significant predictor; however, positive support from the family and family relationships were significantly associated with depression. The role of family as a risk factor for depression in older Korean immigrants and implications for mental health policy, programs, and future research are discussed.

Our investigation was grounded in the recent literature suggesting that cultural identity, adaptation, and the relationship between them are affected by contextual factors. We see the military in general, and the Israeli army in particular, as a highly assimilative context. We therefore predicted that national identity would significantly promote immigrant's adaptation. Three hundred and sixty-five young soldiers who had recently immigrated from the former Soviet Union and serving their compulsory military service in the Israeli Defense Forces, completed anonymous questionnaires. Our findings revealed that national identity was indeed positively related to adjustment, especially adjustment to the military setting. In contrast, ethnic identity was not correlated with adjustment. When classified into acculturation categories, according to Berry's bi-dimensional model, individuals in both the 'marginalization' and the 'separation' groups exhibited low levels of adaptation. Common to these two strategies is the rejection of host culture. Three factors--language abilities, sources of cohesion and goals in service--were examined as possible mediators for the effects of national identity on the immigrants' adjustment to military service. National identity was shown to affect adaptation partially through sources of cohesion and goals in service. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

Assessment tools developed in the elder's own cultural context can maximize appropriate assessment and planning. This article describes the development of a tool for measuring adherence to tradition in Chinese elders. In Chinese tradition, an elder's purpose, meaning, and self-worth are derived, in large part, from their contribution to family, relatives, and the community. Existing measures of filial piety and acculturation do not capture this dimension. Filial piety involves being on the receiving end of care, honor, and obedience from younger generations. Acculturation is the opposite of adherence to tradition. One thousand five-hundred and two Chinese elders in China were asked questions on mutual aid and intergenerational exchange. Factor analysis extracted nine items loading into two factors reflective of traditional exchange. This measure could prove useful in understanding the effect of traditional beliefs upon various psychosocial outcomes.

We studied samples of international students from three Canadian Universities at the beginning of an academic year (N = 228) and at the end of the same year (N = 72). The results supported the hypotheses that autonomous motivation to study abroad is a predictor of students' various adjustment outcomes at different times of the academic year and that the preservation goals have a weaker negative effect upon the adjustment outcomes and this effect is relatively independent from the effect of autonomy.

The variables were operationalized by using Lara Cantu's Masculinity and Femininity Inventory, the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, and the Cultural Lifestyle Inventory. The sample consisted of 34 Spanish-speaking and 24 English-speaking couples. The results show that the husbands' level of affective femininity was predictive of the wives' level of dyadic adjustment. The wives' level of dyadic adjustment contributed more to the couples' overall level of dyadic adjustment than did the husbands. Negative behavior traits such as aggressive masculinity or submissive femininity did not yield significant results as predicted cultural stereotypes. In regards to acculturation, significant correlations were found between cultural lifestyle and dyadic adjustment. The relationship between gender identity and dyadic adjustment remain significant even when both cultural resistance (adherence to traditional culture) and cultural shift (assimilation to host culture) partialled out. As a result, no significant differences were found regarding gender identity and dyadic adjustment among participating couples. Finally, a Contextual-Ecological framework that examines both cognitive and socio-structural elements is proposed in the interpretation of the results.

Telephone interviews were used to collect data using the Korean version Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale, Background and Situational Form, 5-item IADL, Ethnic Attachment Questionnaire, Revised Social Support Questionnaire, Health Risk Behavior Form, and Health Perception Form. Results indicated that older Koreans were more lonely than studies of older Caucasians. Ethnic attachment was the best predictive variable of loneliness and of both emotional and tangible social support. Ethnic attachment, living with spouse, and transportation availability had both direct effects on loneliness and indirect effects on loneliness through social support variables. The relationship between loneliness and age, marital status, English fluency, transportation availability, and living with children differed depending upon the level of social support variables. The only mediation effect of loneliness was between life satisfaction and both emotional and tangible social network size and satisfaction. Loneliness predicted life satisfaction, over-the-counter drug usage, and perceived physical health. Smoking had a significant negative relationship with life satisfaction.

One hundred and ten Turkish immigrants were surveyed through questionnaires. The majority of the participants migrated to Canada within the last ten years. Despite high educational attainments, two-thirds of the sample were either unemployed of underemployed. Inability to integrate fully into the labour force within the first six months in Canada was primarily attributed to the lack of competence in official languages and Canadian work experience, and the difficulty in getting credentials recognized. In time, these barriers seemed to be overcome. In their place, market conditions (e.g., low-paid jobs, inadequate work conditions, economic regression) delayed full integration into the work force. Models that were tested through structural equation modelling (LISREL VIII) revealed that adaptation was affected by both employment-related experiences and psychological well being. Perceived discrimination, acculturation attitudes, sense of coherence, migration motivation, and social networks moderated the relationship among employment-related experiences, psychological well-being and adaptation.

We addressed a bidimensional model of acculturation, considering both orientations toward home and host cultures, and assessed the relevance of Berry's four-cell typology of acculturation (integration, assimilation, separation, and marginalization). Based on the unique characteristics of the present sample, including that they were all born in Korea and had been exposed to their home culture for a substantial amount of time, we hypothesized that their orientation towards original culture would be strong and that simple application of Berry's four-cell typology would not be relevant. As expected, scores on Korean orientation were distributed toward the high end of the scale, suggesting a high level of familiarity and adherence to the original culture; scores on American orientation were correspondingly low. Cluster analysis showed that a two-cluster model was an optimal group classification in the sample used in this investigation. The groups were identified as 'integrated group' and 'separated group.' Compared to the separated group, integrated group was more likely to be younger, married, and educated. More years of residence in the U.S. and better physical and mental health were observed among those who were integrated. The findings call attention to the needs to consider the unique nature of immigrant samples in order to adequately apply the acculturation typologies.

Methods: The data were derived from the Population Study of Chinese Elderly in Chicago (N = 3,159). Negative binomial regressions were performed to predict depression and anxiety, respectively, by entering the three sets of coping resources separately and jointly, controlling for socio-demographic and acculturation variables. Results: Stronger sense of mastery and greater perception of children's filial piety were associated with better mental health outcomes. Spousal support was not associated with any mental health outcomes, and family support was actually associated with greater depression and anxiety. Stronger community cohesion was associated with fewer depressive symptoms but greater anxiety. Conclusion: Older immigrants’ sense of control and perception that children adhere to traditional family norms are important mental health protective factors. Whereas depending on families for support may compromise their well-being, community cohesion could be a double-edged sword for their mental health. Future studies shall further disentangle the associations among sense of mastery, reliance on family and ethnic enclaves for support, and older immigrants’ well-being.

Latent class analysis specified separated, partial separated, bicultural and marginal profiles of acculturation among Latino immigrants. Notably, our findings identified a small, albeit significant, marginal class among Latino immigrants, and both bivariate and multivariate findings demonstrated that those in marginal class reported the poorest mental health. Our findings further revealed that the observed mental health disadvantage among the marginal class relative to other immigrants was due to their disadvantage in family support . Overall, this investigation further underscores the importance of family support as an element of immigrant acculturation experience and mental health. From a policy perspective, social support, specifically family support, is critical for immigrant mental health, and a lack of family support may increase the risk for developing a marginal experience and mental health problems among a growing population of Latino immigrants in the United States.

Specifically, the study investigated the mediating effects of adjustment in occupational and social life domains on the relationship between acculturation and psychological adjustment for 391 refugees from the former Soviet Union. The study used bilinear measures of acculturation to the host (American) and heritage (Russian) cultures. Using Structural Equation Modeling, the study confirmed the hypothesized relationships, such that the positive effects of American acculturation on psychological adjustment were mediated by occupational adjustment, and the effects of Russian acculturation on psychological adjustment were mediated by satisfaction with co-ethnic social support. Psychological adjustment was measured in two ways, as psychological well-being, using a measure of life satisfaction, and as symptoms of depression and anxiety, using the Hopkins symptom checklist (HSCL). Life satisfaction served as a mediator between adjustment in occupational and social domains and HSCL, suggesting that it may be an intervening variable through which environmental stress associated with immigration contributes to the development of symptoms of mental disorder.

The interview gathered information on acculturation and risk behaviors including smoking, alcohol use and number of sexual partners. The results suggest that more acculturated women living in the US are more likely to consume alcohol. US residence and higher acculturation level was marginally associated with having more than one sexual partner. There were no differences between odds of smoking among Chavinda and Madera women.

A nationwide adult probability sample (N = 2360) included Finnish repatriates and Russian and Estonian immigrants from the former Soviet Union, Russia, and Estonia. In the total sample, linguistic acculturation was directly and negatively related to psychological well-being. Increased acculturation also influenced well-being indirectly through an increase in perceived discrimination. Although acculturation also increased the use of ethnic and host support networks, the effect of these social support networks on well-being depended on the stress level. Particularly, the direct effect of acculturation on well-being disappeared and was instead mediated by social support networks when examining the more vulnerable subsamples of the study, i.e., women and those who perceived substantial discrimination. Higher levels of SES were linked to better well-being through increased health status. It was concluded that the acculturation process plays a dual role in psychological functioning and that it is important to ensure more directly not only immigrants' cultural but also their socioeconomic integration.

Methods: We analyzed data from 313 pregnant Latina women at San Francisco General Hospital. The dependent variable was prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), categorized as underweight (<18.5), normal (18.5-24.9, reference), overweight (25-29.9), or obese (≥30). The independent variables were acculturation metrics, measured by acculturation index score, degree of Americanization, national origin subgroup, and the number of years residing in the United States. Results: One third of women were overweight, and one fifth were obese. Education (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81-0.96) was inversely associated with overweight, after adjusting for confounding variables. Longer residence in the United States (OR 1.08 for each additional year residing in the United States, 95% CI 1.02-1.15), older age (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.16), and higher gravidity, the total number of pregnancies (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.09-1.84), were significantly associated with obesity. Conclusions: One measure of acculturation, length of time residing in the United States, was associated with obesity among childbearing Latina women.

Prior to this study, it was unknown whether immigrant Nigerian children and adolescents aged 9 to 14 years are at higher risk for obesity as a result of acculturation after migrating to the United States. The purpose of this study, guided by the social cognitive theory, was to assess the risk factors that lead to increased childhood obesity in this at-risk population. Data were collected from 163 participants through a cross-sectional quantitative design involving the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System questionnaires, the body-mass index scale, and Stephenson's Multi-Group Acculturation Scale. Participants were recruited through flyers in a public setting. Descriptive statistics and multiple regression were used in the data analysis. The results indicated that multiple factors are responsible for high rates of obesity in this at-risk population, with results showing significant relationships between obesity and age ( p = .002), employment (p = .005), duration of residence in the United States (p < .0005), and dominant society immersion (p = .001). Recommendations include developing community-based education programs and policies that support healthy lifestyles and conducting further research that increases the scope of study. This study has implications for positive social change in that it may increase awareness of the value of exercise and healthier eating patterns in the Nigerian community and may support the Healthy People 2020 goal of improving life expectancy and reducing obesity in at-risk populations.

The authors posit that the acculturation orientation of immigrants determines their consumer loyalty to both ethnic and mainstream brands and stores. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of Hispanic consumers in the USA and consumers from the former Soviet Union in Israel, this study tests a model in which two acculturation continua, original culture maintenance and host culture adaptation, serve as antecedents for immigrants’ consumer loyalty. Findings: Acculturation determines the extent of immigrants’ consumer loyalty. Both acculturation continua are associated with distinct loyalty patterns that are similar across the two immigrant groups. Research limitations/implications: Despite sampling limitations, the paper demonstrates that immigrants’ acculturation orientation influences their loyalty to ethnic and mainstream brands and stores. Shared by ethnic consumers in two culturally diverse markets, this relationship transcends geographic boundaries. Practical implications: The results provide insights for marketers with respect to the development of segmentation and positioning strategies and tactical implementations that address the preferences of ethnic consumers. Social implications: This paper highlights the importance of understanding the unique needs of ethnic consumers and addressing them. Successful integration of immigrant consumers into the marketplace can also help in their integration into the host society at large.

Longitudinal data to confirm this are lacking. We examined acculturation and diet over time in 312 Chinese immigrant women in Philadelphia, recruited October 2005 to April 2008 and followed with interviews and dietary recalls until April 2010. Associations were modeled using generalized estimating equations to account for repeated measures over time. Increasing length of US residence was associated with a small (~1 %/year) but significant increase in acculturation score (p < 0.0001), which in turn was significantly associated with increased energy density of the diet, percent of energy from fat, and sugar intake, and lower dietary moderation score. These findings provide longitudinal evidence that acculturation increases with length of US residence and is accompanied by dietary changes.

We conducted a secondary analysis of the 2006 American Community Survey using a representative sample of older Filipinos (2,113 males; 3,078 females) to measure functional limitations, limitations in activities of daily living, blindness/deafness and memory/learning problems. Filipino males who were Americans by birth/naturalization had higher odds of blindness/deafness (OR 2.94; 95 % CI = 1.69, 5.12) than non-citizens. Males who spoke English at home had higher odds of blindness/deafness (OR 1.82; 95 % CI = 1.05, 3.17) and memory/learning problems (OR 2.28; 95 % CI = 1.25, 4.15), while females had higher odds of memory/learning problems (OR 1.75; 95 % CI = 1.13, 2.73). Acculturation is associated with greater odds of disabilities for Filipino men.

Surinam is a former Dutch colony in South America. Methods: We randomly selected men and women aged 35-60 years: ethnic Dutch, n = 552; South Asian, n = 306; Afro-Caribbean, n = 660. Intakes of fruit, vegetables, red meat, fish, vegetable oils, breakfast and salt were measured using a short questionnaire that formed the basis for a 'diet quality indicator' score. Highest education was measured and acculturation of the Surinamese groups was assessed by age at migration, number of resident years and a scale measure of social contacts with ethnic Dutch. Results: Compared with ethnic Dutch, both Surinamese groups scored higher on overall diet quality (P ≤ 0.001) but some aspects of diet (breakfast and salt use) were less prudent. Education was positively associated with diet quality in ethnic Dutch (P ≤ 0.01), but not consistently so in Surinamese. Associations with social contact with ethnic Dutch varied for different quality aspects of the diet. Residence duration (mean = 22 years) and age at migration (mean = 21 years) were not associated with diet. Conclusions: A greater degree of acculturation does not necessarily lead to a less healthful diet in migrants. In addition, the association of education level with diet may differ for migrant groups. The diet of migrants differ from host populations, suggesting that migrant groups should be considered in the development of nutrition health promotion activities.

Somali, Latino, and Hmong adolescents in Minnesota provided data as part of the EAT 2010 (Eating and Activity in Teens) cohort study (N = 1,066). Acculturation was based on nativity, language usually spoken at home, and length of residence in the United States. Chi-square, ANOVA, and regression models were used to test for differences in adolescent well-being by acculturation and ethnic group, and interaction terms were added to models to test effect modification by ethnicity. Hmong adolescents had the highest mean acculturation scores (4.4 ± 1.5), whereas Somali adolescents (2.2 ± 1.8) were the least acculturated. Independent of ethnicity, acculturation was positively associated with marijuana (OR: 1.38; CI [1.25, 1.53]) and alcohol use (OR: 1.12; CI [1.02, 1.22]), and was negatively associated with academic achievement, based on grade point average (β = −0.07; CI [−0.12, −0.03]).

To investigate this problem, we examine the potential effects of acculturation to host culture on respondent comprehension of a set of health survey questions among two distinct Latino populations on the US mainland: Mexican–Americans and Puerto Ricans. Specifically, comprehension-related respondent behaviors coded from 345 face-to-face interviews conducted with Mexican–American, Puerto Rican, African American, and non-Latino White adults living in Chicago are examined. Findings indicate that Latino respondents who were born outside of the US and who have a preference for communicating in Spanish, relative to English, were more likely to express comprehension difficulties.

This study is concerned primarily with acculturation of immigrants or their children and grandchildren. Observation was made that various nationalities presented different problems of acculturation. Psychotherapy has to work out the problems of motivation for culture change, and touch upon early childhood identifications.

The predictions were largely borne out. The language orientation measures yielded a (symbolic) language value factor and a (behavioral) language preference factor. In all countries Turkish identity was a positive predictor and mainstream identity a negative predictor of both the language value and preference factor. Mainstream and Turkish identity showed stronger negative correlations in the less pluralistic countries.

Previous studies have suggested that elevated rates of depression among different migrant groups might be due to patterns of acculturation and migration related risk factors. This paper focused on prevalence rates of depressive disorders and related risk factors among individuals with Turkish migration backgrounds. Methods: A population-based sample of 662 individuals with Turkish migration backgrounds were interviewed by bilingual interviewers using a standardised diagnostic interview for DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 diagnoses (CIDI DIA-X Version 2.8). Associations between 12-month prevalence rates of depressive disorders with potential risk factors were assessed, including gender, age, socioeconomic status, acculturation status and migration status. Results: 12-month prevalence rates of any depressive disorder were 29.0%, 14.4% of major depressive disorder (MDD) and 14.7% of dysthymia. Older age and low socioeconomic status were most consistently related to higher risks of depressive disorders. Acculturation status showed associations with subtypes of depressive disorder. Associations differed between men and women. Symptom severity of MDD was linked to gender, with females being more affected by severe symptoms. Conclusion: The prevalence of depressive disorders is high in individuals with Turkish migration backgrounds, which can be partly explained by older age, low socioeconomic status and acculturation pressures. Only a limited number of risk factors were assessed. Acculturation in particular is a complex process which might not be sufficiently represented by the applied measures.

The study found that English proficiency and other covariates affected how Asian Americans perceived mental health need. Implications for understanding the help-seeking behaviors of older Asian immigrants are discussed.

Aim: To explore the relationship between acculturation and psychological distress among first-generation Muslim migrants from Turkey and Morocco in the Netherlands. Methods: A cross-sectional study. Respondents were interviewed in their preferred language. Acculturation was measured with the Lowlands Acculturation Scale (LAS) and psychological distress with the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Data were complete for 321 subjects and analyzed with multivariate linear regression. Results: Less skills for living in Dutch society was associated with distress (p = 0.032). Feelings of loss were related to distress among Moroccans (p = 0.037). There was an interaction between traditionalism and ethnic background ( p = 0.037); traditionalism was related to less distress among Moroccans (p = 0.020), but not among Turkish. Finally, there was an interaction by gender among Turks (p = 0.029); conservative norms and values seemed to be related to distress among men (p = 0.062), not women. Conclusion: Successful contact and participation in Dutch society, and maintenance of heritage culture and identity were moderately associated with less psychological distress. Improving mastery of the dominant language in host societies, and allowing migrants to preserve their traditions, might be effective measures in improving the mental well-being of migrants.

Results from hierarchical regression analyses indicated that perceived discrimination, positive religious coping, and negative religious coping were significantly associated with depressive symptoms. Further analyses indicated that positive religious coping moderated the perceived discrimination–depressive symptoms association.

However, the impact of the acculturation on the well-being of Somalis has not been documented. The current explanatory mixed methods study examined the relationship between the acculturation strategies and the Subjective Well-being (SW) of the Somali immigrants living in the U.S. The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) (Diener, Emmons, Larsen & Griffin, 1985) was used to measure life satisfaction, and Stephenson's (2000) Multigroup Acculturation Scale (SMAS) captured the main acculturation strategies of the Somali immigrants. The study also employed focus groups to seek (a) community explanation of the quantitative results, and (b) community views of acculturation challenges and opportunities. A sample of 124 first-generation Somali immigrants living in two large U.S. Midwest cities participated in the study. Results indicated significant relationship between the acculturation strategies used by the Somali immigrants and their SW. Integration was related to the highest SW, while marginalization was related to the lowest SW. However, the study found no significant differences in the SW of the Somali genders. Additionally, the focus groups revealed that youth problems were the greatest threats to the community well-being. Finally, while results highlighted some important acculturation issues affecting the well-being of the Somali immigrants, further investigations are encouraged to understand better the acculturation process of the Somali immigrants.

In order to measure personality and psychopathology the MMPI-2-RF RC scales were utilized. This study was significant in its conceptualization of acculturation. The use of the RC scales has rarely been found, and it is the first time it is being employed with regard to a Greek-American community sample of first generation immigrants. Results indicated that lower mainstream-culture identification was associated with higher scores on Demoralization (RCd), Somatic Complaints (RC1), Cynicism (RC3), Ideas of Persecution (RC6), and Aberrant Behaviors (RC8); and lower heritage-culture identification was associated with higher scores on Somatic Complaints (RC1) to the direction of psychopathology. Individuals testing in the Separated category, that is, who continued to identify more with their heritage culture and less with their new (mainstream) culture experienced more somatic problems. The performance of the sample was in line with prior research, and the findings of this study are consistent with previous studies that found different levels of acculturation to have differential impact on the MMPI-2-RF performance, and studies that found higher identification with both mainstream culture and heritage culture were associated with more favorable mental health outcomes. Findings supported the premise that both mainstream and heritage cultures offer benefits for people living in and/or experiencing multiple cultures. In addition, the findings of this study indicated support for the bidimentional model of acculturation as most participants had a high identification with both mainstream and heritage cultures.

Background: Acculturation is an important indicator for immigrant health. Less empirical research has been conducted on the association between acculturation and breast cancer experience among Chinese immigrant women in the USA. Design: A mixed methods study. Methods: A total of 107 Chinese-American women with breast cancer completed the structured questionnaire survey, and 16 women completed face-to-face in-depth interviews. Results: In the quantitative findings, acculturation was related to health beliefs, social support and life stress. Cultural interpretations of the qualitative information are offered to show that breast cancer experience was intertwined with cultural adaptation in a given immigrant environment. Chinese cultural beliefs persistently, even after years of immigration, guide Chinese-American immigrant women to respond to breast cancer across the meaning of health and illness, family ties and involvement and social interaction. Conclusion: Our findings show that acculturation is related to health beliefs, social support and life stress in the trajectory of breast cancer adaptation among Chinese-American immigrant women. Life stresses derived from immigration bring additional difficulties for immigrant women living with cancer. Relevance to clinical practice: This study pinpoints that traditional cultural beliefs and immigration stress may influence Chinese-American women to cope with breast cancer. To promote culturally sensitive cancer care for immigrants, healthcare professionals should be aware of and learn intercultural competence. Ethnic social support or outreach healthcare programme may benefit new immigrant families or the immigrant families, who lack social connection, to cope with cancer.

The study also examined the demographic, ethnocultural, and psychological factors that could influence subcontinental migrant groups’ attitudes towards acculturation and their acculturation strategies. Method: A cross-sectional design was used in which the dependent variables were the four acculturation strategies. Multivariate data analysis was conducted. Pearson’s correlation, analysis of variance, and step-wise multiple regression analyses were performed to establish the relationships among the study variables. Results: Integration was the most preferred strategy and marginalisation was the least preferred strategy for all ethnic groups. Acculturation preferences are predicted partly by the adolescents’ ethnicity, their ethnic identity, friendship choices, acculturative stress, sense of mastery (self-concept) and gender. The findings provide significant information on the acculturation practices of Indian subcontinental adolescents, including their ethnic identity search and commitment, their psychological well-being and their integration strategies. Conclusions: Educational institutions could benefit from increased awareness of the needs of these culturally diverse groups, especially if this information is incorporated into teacher training materials. The inclusion of intercultural relations courses in the academic curriculum would promote harmonious relations between culturally diverse ethnic groups.

The purpose of this study was to examine associations between these acculturation strategies and symptoms of depression, a common yet underdiagnosed and undertreated mental disorder. We used data from the Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America (MASALA) study (n = 856). Data were collected between October 2010 and March 2013 in the San Francisco Bay Area and Chicago. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the CES-D Scale. Applying a simple new method to account for uncertainty in class assignment when modeling latent classes as an exposure, we found that respondents in the Separation class had more depressive symptoms than those in the Integration class, but only after taking into account self-reported social support (b = 0.11; p = 0.05). There were no differences in depressive symptoms among those in the Assimilation class vs. those in the Integration class (b = −0.06; p = 0.41).

Linguistic and temporal proxy measures for acculturation were independent variables along with ethnicity, plus controls for gender, age, education, and income in multivariate analyses. About one-fifth of contrasts between non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, English-interviewed Hispanics, and Spanish-interviewed Hispanics were statistically significant (Bonferroni-corrected) and of medium or higher affect size, with most featuring the Spanish-interviewed Hispanics. Knowledge variables featured the most significant differences. Specifically, Spanish-interviewed Hispanics reported less concern, familiarity with pollution, recognition of high pollution, and vigorous outdoor activity, and greater belief that government overregulates pollution than English-interviewed Hispanics (and than the other two groups on most of these variables too). English-interviewed Hispanics did not differ from non-Hispanic whites, but did on several variables from non-Hispanic blacks. Temporal proxies of acculturation among the foreign-born were far less significant, but concern and familiarity with air pollution increased with time spent in the United States, while belief in overregulation and a positive trend in New Jersey pollution increased with time in the nation of origin.

Despite previous research supporting the advantages of developing a bicultural style to acculturation, mixed results have been found regarding native and host country acculturation patterns among resettled refugees and how these patterns may be associated with refugee mental health outcomes. Methods: The objective of this study was not only to consider the roles that US and native acculturation may play on the self-report of identity distress and internalizing symptoms among refugee adolescents more broadly, but also to consider the role various dimensions of acculturation (e.g., cultural identity, language competence, and cultural competence) may play for refugee adolescents post-resettlement. Results and Conclusions: The study findings indicate that native acculturation, and more specifically native cultural identity, may serve as significant protective factors against identity distress among adolescent refugees post-resettlement, with native cultural identity additionally serving as a protective factor against internalizing symptoms. US acculturation was not found to be significantly associated with identity distress or internalizing symptoms, nor were the acculturative dimensions of language learning (i.e., English and native language competencies), cultural knowledge (i.e., US and native cultural knowledge competencies), or US cultural identity.

To achieve this goal, measures of acculturation, income, and education were stochastically incorporated into the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (PARS). Using the 1990 California Tobacco Survey and U.S. Census data, we estimated the combination of zip-code-based measures that most accurately predicts an individual, language-based acculturation index for Hispanics and Asians. Logistic regression was used to investigate the role of these variables in safety belt nonuse in fatal MVCs. We found that acculturation has a positive direct effect on safety belt use among Hispanics. We hypothesize that this positive direct effect is caused by Hispanic immigrants learning the benefits of wearing safety belts. However, our study also suggests an indirect negative effect of acculturation on safety belt use through drinking and driving. Prevention programs aimed at increasing the safety of Hispanic drivers not only need to take acculturation differences into account, but also need to be comprehensive in their message, simultaneously targeting both seat belt nonuse and drinking-and-driving problems.

This study aims to identify differences among five ethnic subgroups (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Filipino, and Vietnamese) of older Asian immigrants in California and to examine predictors of mental health service utilization within each ethnic subgroup. The Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations (BMVP) was used to guide the secondary data analysis of a sample of 3,453 older Asian immigrants from the 2009, 2011-2012, and 2013 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS). ANOVA and chi square tests were used to examine group differences and logistic and linear regression analyses were performed to examine predictors of mental health service use and the frequency of mental health service use, respectively. The older Asian immigrant samples were not homogeneous. The Japanese and Filipino samples had better socioeconomic status and higher level of acculturation than others. The Korean sample had the lowest level of mental distress and least use of mental health services. Help-seeking patterns regarding mental health care differed across subgroups. Decreasing age (Chinese and Japanese), female (Vietnamese), not being married (Korean), lower education (Japanese), decreasing perceived safety (Vietnamese), higher levels of mental distress (all), and having perceived need (all) were associated with an increasing likelihood of using mental health services.

Research indicates that immigration-related factors such as acculturation (Berry, 1980; Suinn, 2010) and transnational ties (Murphy & Mahalingam, 2004) are important in understanding elevated depressive symptoms in Vietnamese immigrants (Leung, Cheung, & Cheung, 2010) and other immigrant populations. Empirical research, however, has yet to examine acculturation, transnational ties, and depressive symptoms concomitantly. To fill this gap, the current study employed both a mediation and a moderation framework to separately examine whether transnational ties mediated or moderated the relationships between dimensions of acculturation and depressive symptoms. The sample comprised of pilot study (N = 37) and dissertation study (N = 107) participants who were recruited through convenience and snowball sampling in the Southwest and Midwest regions of the United States. Participants completed surveys comprised of demographic information, the Asian American Multidimensional Acculturation Scale (AAMAS; Chung, Kim, & Abreu, 2004), the Transnationalism Scale (TS; Murphy & Mahalingam, 2004), and the Center for Epidemiological Study of Depression scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977). No mediation effects were found for transnational ties as a mediator between the associations of acculturation dimensions with depressive symptoms. Significant moderation effects were found for the Financial and Commercial Ties aspect of transnational ties in moderating the relationship between acculturation to the Vietnamese culture and depressive symptoms. As acculturation to the Vietnamese culture increased, levels of depressive symptoms decreased, and the decrease in depressive symptoms was more pronounced for Vietnamese immigrants who reported higher levels of Financial and Commercial Ties compared to those who reported lower levels. When acculturation to the Vietnamese culture was high, participants with high Financial and Commercial Ties had lower depressive symptoms than those with the same level of acculturation but engaged in low Financial and Commercial Ties. However, for participants with low identification with the Vietnamese culture but engaged in high Financial and Commercial Ties, their depressive symptoms were higher than those with the same low identification with the Vietnamese culture but engaged in low Financial and Commercial Ties.

Participants were recruited and enrolled through the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service from August 2002 to March 2004. Determinants of SSS were explored using a series of linear regressions. In analyses adjusting for demographics (including objective indicators of SES), speaking Spanish at home and work and living in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, respectively, were associated with low SSS. However, in analyses including demographics, acculturation, and neighborhood characteristics, only income, education, and acculturation remained associated with SSS. Consistent with results from a previous study in the area (Franzini & Fernandez-Esquer, 2006), less acculturation predicted low SSS among immigrant Latino smokers. However, unlike previous research, these associations were maintained after controlling for SES. Results suggest that the density of less acculturated Latinos within economically deprived neighborhoods might account for the disappearance of neighborhood effects in the final model.

Using person-oriented latent profile analysis, this study identified acculturation strategies among Korean American early adolescents living in the Midwest. Two-hundred ninety-one families were interviewed in 2007 that included 220 youth (mean age 13, 47.7 % female), along with 272 mothers and 164 fathers (N = 656).

Instead, the literature is dominated by studies conducted with the Asian and Latino immigrant Diasporas highlighting the complex relationship between acculturation and various psychological factors. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between acculturation, ethnic identity, and psychological outcomes in a sample of immigrants of African-Caribbean descent. Using Berry's (1997) theoretical framework for acculturation research, we hypothesized that ethnic identity would mediate the relationship between acculturation and psychological outcomes. A sample of adult, self-identified immigrants of African-Caribbean descent recruited in the Houston metropolitan area completed a survey packet that included a bidimensional measure of acculturation, a measure of ethnic identity, and scales of self-esteem, life satisfaction, and depression. Statistical analyses conducted with PROCESS revealed that ethnic identity did not mediate the relationship between acculturation and psychological outcomes. However, supplemental moderation analysis revealed mainstream orientation leads to more perceived life satisfaction when ethnic identity ranges from moderate to high. Future research should continue to study the process of acculturation in immigrants of African Caribbean descent using qualitative and longitudinal study designs.

Methods: We used logistic regression models to examine ethnic variations in allostatic load scores among non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, and people of Mexican origin. We also examined associations between measures of acculturation and allostatic load scores among people of Mexican origin only. Results: Foreign-born Mexicans were the least likely group to score in the higher allostatic load categories. Among individuals of Mexican origin, US-born Mexican Americans had higher allostatic load scores than foreign-born Mexicans, and acculturation measures did not account for the difference. Conclusions: Our findings expand on recent research from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey with respect to ethnicity and allostatic load. Our results are consistent with the healthy immigrant hypothesis (i.e., newer immigrants are healthier) and the acculturation hypothesis, according to which the longer Mexican immigrants reside in the United States, the greater their likelihood of potentially losing culture-related health-protective effects.

This study aimed at identifying such subgroups, predicting group membership by pre-migration factors, and testing for acculturation-related experiences with the host culture over time. The sample comprised 366 adolescent diaspora migrants (59% female, 16 years old) from the former Soviet Union to Germany. A person-oriented and longitudinal approach using growth mixture modeling revealed three subtypes of cultural identification change. The first subgroup (Idealists) comprised adolescents with high and stable identification with their host culture and low but increasing identification with their heritage culture. The second group (Skeptics) showed low and stable identification with their host culture and high but decreasing identification with their heritage culture. The third group (Realists) reported medium-level and stable identification with both host and heritage cultures. Group comparisons showed pre-migration differences: Idealists and Realists most likely spoke the host-culture language (i.e., German) as a native language and Idealists reported the highest level of maternal education. Membership in subgroups also related to adolescents’ perception of their current situation in the host culture: Idealists reported less acculturation-related hassles with respect to language and socio-cultural adaptation. Skeptics perceived lower expectations by natives to get in contact with natives and higher expectations to spend time with members of their immigrant group than the average immigrant.

Korean immigrants have a response bias toward positive affect items in CES-D, which decreases as they adopt more American Orientation. CES-D lacks cultural equivalence for Korean immigrants.

The stress of identity and body image development can be exacerbated by acculturative stress faced by immigrant adolescents. Using a person-centered analysis, we investigated immigrant adolescents’ (n = 57) profiles based on assimilation to the United States (US), weight, and body image dissatisfaction. Analyses included an exploratory two-step clustering technique using maximum likelihood estimation procedures to assign class membership. Follow-up analyses then examined latent class membership by adolescent age, gender, culture of origin, and immigration generation. Results indicated several meaningful latent groups of adolescents based on their BID, acculturation, and BMI. These profiles included one in which adolescents who were underweight and more assimilated to US culture also reported more satisfaction with their body image. A second profile emerged of adolescents who were normal weight or overweight and less assimilated, who also reported higher levels of body image dissatisfaction, with a desire to be thinner. The third cluster profile included adolescents who were of normal weight, but were higher on assimilation and were among the most dissatisfied with their body image. Our findings suggest that immigrant adolescents at all levels of acculturation are internalizing the thin body ideal prominent in the US, with a variety of implications for their sense of body image and BMI.

Clothing communicates information about an individual’s personality, group membership, and even context of social situations. Research suggests that clothing is part of a dynamic social process, linked to ethnic identity, religious identity, and self-esteem. However, psychological research examining immigrants’ clothing choices remains scant. The present studies examine links between clothing preference, acculturation strategies and cultural identity among immigrants. Study 1 explored meanings and symbolism of Canadian/Western versus ethnic clothing for Chinese, Korean, and Indian immigrants (N = 15) through qualitative methodology. Participants described wearing ethnic clothing to express pride in and identification with heritage culture, while wearing Canadian clothing for practicality and to match social norms. Studies 2 and 3 surveyed Chinese, Indian, and European Canadians. Study 2 (N = 324) examined relations between ethnic identity and attitudes toward Canadian and ethnic clothing. Study 3 (N = 196) examined attitudes toward clothing (formal vs. casual) in different contexts (among peers of same or different ethnic background). Both immigrant groups reported being more likely to wear ethnic clothing among members of the same ethnicity but were otherwise more likely to wear Canadian clothing. Once social context was accounted for, there was a relation between ethnic identity and likelihood of wearing ethnic clothing. This effect was found for Chinese Canadians. Overall, our findings suggest that immigrants’ clothing choices are influenced by who they interact with. Immigrants choose clothing as a dimension to manifest their values and represent their adaptation to their society of settlement.

One problem with this migration is that 1st and 2nd generation immigrants may prefer different leadership styles than those of the mainstream culture. The purpose of this survey-based quantitative comparative study was to investigate the effects of acculturation on the work-related cultural values and leadership style preferences of Mexican immigrants living in the United States. The research question that guided this study focused on the differences in work-related cultural values and preferred leadership styles between 2 generations of Mexican immigrants, Mexicans, and U.S.-born Caucasians. Two hundred and forty-five participants completed the survey. The researcher used a Likert-type self-assessing questionnaire adapted from existing instruments to measure the work-related cultural values and preferred leadership styles of two generations of Mexican immigrants, native Mexicans, and U.S.-born Caucasians. Statistical tools, such as correlations, Cronbach's alpha, t-test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to test measurement reliability and to test for differences in the mean scores of the criterion variables among the 4 groups. The researcher found that, in the aggregate, Mexican immigrants did not acculturate to the mainstream values of the United States, 2nd generation Mexican immigrants' scores were similar to those of U.S.-born Caucasians in work-related values, and all groups prefer the servant leadership style. Implications for social change may include raising the awareness of human resource managers of the differences and similarities in values and preferences of their staff, which may help improve the relationships between managers and the employees.

However, little is known about the sources and predictors of social anxiety under the context of cultural change. Based on the diathesis-stress framework of social anxiety (Rapee & Spence, 2004), which posits that social anxiety is resulted from the interaction of genetic, cultural and environmental factors, this study examined relationships among social anxiety and personality traits (neuroticism and extraversion), cultural adaptation (acculturation, enculturation and perceived English fluency), and an environmental stressor (perceived racial discrimination). Participants were 140 first-generation Chinese/Taiwanese immigrants, aged 18 to 71. A unique feature of this study is that social anxiety was assessed in two social contexts: mainstream society and ethnic community. That is, participants reported their levels of social anxiety interacting with mainstream White Americans (Mainstream SA) and with other Chinese in the U.S. (Ethnic SA), as measured by the revised Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (Mattick & Clarke, 1998). It was hypothesized that participants would report experiencing significantly more Mainstream SA than Ethnic SA. Neuroticism, extraversion, acculturation, perceived English fluency and perceived racial discrimination were hypothesized to jointly and uniquely predict Mainstream SA. Moreover, neuroticism, extraversion and enculturation were hypothesized to jointly and uniquely predict Ethnic SA. All hypotheses were supported at p ≤ .017. First, a dependent t-test indicated that scores on Mainstream SA were significantly higher than scores on Ethnic SA. Second, hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that personality traits contributed 35% of the variance in the prediction of Mainstream SA. Cultural factors contributed an additional 10% of the variance after controlling for personality traits. Perceived racial discrimination accounted for an additional 4% of the variance. The full model explained a total of 48% of the variance in Mainstream SA with extraversion, neuroticism and perceived discrimination being the unique predictors. With respect to Ethnic SA, personality traits contributed 29% of the variance. Cultural factors added an additional 5% of the variance after controlling for personality traits. Perceived racial discrimination added an additional 8% of the variance. The full model explained 43% of the variance in Ethnic SA with extraversion and perceived discrimination being the unique predictors.

Our findings revealed that the language and web sources immigrants choose to use can be predicted by the acculturation strategies they utilize to cope with the new culture. This study serves as a timely and imperative call for further consideration of the role that acculturation plays in determining how immigrants seek health information and utilize the healthcare services of their host society.

We examined the influences of school diversity and acculturation on the quantity and quality of cross-and same-race friendships. Surprisingly, students who came from schools that are more diverse reported fewer cross-race friendships and lower levels of social support from their cross-race friends. American acculturation predicted greater levels of social support from cross-race friends. For same-race friendships, students who went to schools with higher percentage of Asian students reported more same-race friendships; however, percentage of Asian students was not a significant predictor of social support from same-race friends. Students who reported greater levels of Vietnamese acculturation reported greater levels of social support from their same-race friends.

It was hypothesized that immigrant and minority individuals who show different acculturation orientations differ in their cultural value fit. The highest cultural value fit was expected for individuals pursuing an assimilation orientation, the lowest fit for individuals with a separation orientation. Individuals with a marginalization or integration orientation were expected to take a mid position. Survey data were used from immigrant and minority adolescents: Immigrants from countries of the Former Soviet Union (FSU) to Germany (N = 862) and Israel (N = 435), immigrants from Turkey to Germany (N = 664), and members of the Arab minority in Israel (N = 488). Results of Analyses of Variance showed similar patterns in all four samples in line with the hypothesis but pointed also to stronger effects among FSU immigrants as opposed to Turkish immigrants and Arab Israelis. Results are discussed with regard to the general contribution of the cultural fit research for the acculturation research and with regard to the role of cultural value fit for psychological well-being of immigrants and minority members. The stronger effects found among the FSU samples as opposed to the Turkish respectively Arab Israeli sample are discussed against the background of the fact that the former are mainly diaspora-immigrants for which cultural value adaptation to the receiving country might be easier compared to the latter.

Questionnaires developed to measure acculturation are typically designed for specific ethnic populations and adult experiences. This study developed a questionnaire that measures acculturation among ethnically diverse populations of youth that can be included as a module in population surveys. Methods: Questionnaires measuring acculturation in youth were identified in the literature. The importance of items from the existing questionnaires was determined using a Delphi process and this informed the development of our questionnaire. The questionnaire was then pilot tested using a sample of 248 Canadians aged 18–25 via an online system. Participants identified as East and South East Asian (27.8%), South Asian (17.7%) and Black (13.7%). The majority were 1st (33.5%) or 2nd generation immigrants (52.0%). After redundant items were eliminated, exploratory factor analysis grouped items into domains, and, for each domain, internal consistency, and convergent validity with immigrant generation then age at immigration estimated. A subset of participants re-completed the questionnaire for reliability estimation. Results: The literature review yielded 117 articles that used 13 questionnaires with a total of 440 questions. The Delphi process reduced these to 32 questions. Pilot testing occurred in 248 Canadians aged 18–25. Following item reduction, 16 questions in three domains remained: dominant culture, heritage language, and heritage culture. All had good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alphas > .75). The mean dominant domain score increased with immigrant generation (1st generation: 3.69 (95% CI: 3.49–3.89), 2nd: 4.13 (4.00–4.26), 3rd: 4.40 (4.19– 4.61)), and mean heritage language score was higher among those who immigrated after age 12 than before (p = .0001), indicative of convergent validity.

HEPESE is a longitudinal cohort study of 3,050 non-institutionalized Mexican Americans aged 65 years at baseline (1993–1994) from 5 Southwestern states. Diabetes incidence was ascertained in 4 follow-up surveys to 2004–05 by respondent self-reported physician-diagnosis of diabetes, high blood glucose, or sugar in the urine. Language of interview, immigrant generation, gender, age, education, family history of diabetes, smoking status, alcohol use, health insurance type and self-reported height and weight were assessed. High socioeconomic status (SES) was defined by high school graduation and non-Medicaid insurance. Cox’s proportional hazards models were fit to evaluate the effects of language acculturation, generation and SES on incident diabetes. 845 of 3,050 (27.7 %) Mexican Americans had diabetes at baseline and were younger, more educated, and more likely to have health insurance than those without diabetes. Risk of developing diabetes increased for Spanish-speaking respondents with low SES from 1st to 3rd generation (HR = 1.76, 95 % CI = 1.02–3.03) and from 2nd to 3rd generation (HR = 2.15, 95 % CI = 1.20–3.84).

Data (n = 703) were collected among three population-based samples of working-age Vietnamese immigrants, repatriated emigrants and never-migrated Vietnamese nationals. This allows for a decomposition exercise to separate the effects of migration effects from selection effects on body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio (WHR). Immigrants are more likely to be overweight and to have high WHR, relative to both never-leavers and returnees, a pattern reflecting the importance of migration over selection. Among immigrants, coming to the US at a younger age is associated with higher BMI and WHR levels. And longer length of residence in the US is related to higher BMI. While higher Vietnamese language proficiency is related to a lower BMI level, being bilingual (proficient in both English and Vietnamese) is associated with lower risks for being overweight. The distinct pattern of results suggests that more problematic weight status and fat distribution among Vietnamese immigrants relative to Vietnamese nationals are not artifacts of the types of persons choosing to emigrate, but rather are due to acculturation to American diet and lifestyles. While efforts to promote and maintain traditional patterns of diet and lifestyle are likely to help Vietnamese and other immigrants avoid the perils of American patterns, facilitating a bi-cultural orientation is perhaps the most realistic approach for preserving protective features of the culture of origin with regard to body weight and fat distribution.

The canonical view is that intermarriage with the native‐born White population represents a pathway to assimilation that varies over geographic space in response to uneven marital opportunities. Using data on past‐year marriage from the 2009–2014 American Community Survey, the authors demonstrate high rates of intermarriage among Hispanics. The analyses identify whether Hispanics marry coethnics, non‐co‐ethnic Hispanics, non‐Hispanic Whites, non‐Hispanic Blacks, or other minorities. The authors highlight variation by race, nativity, and socioeconomic status and reveal that Hispanics living in new immigrant destinations are more likely to intermarry than those living in traditional Hispanic gateways. Indeed, the higher out‐marriage in new destinations disappears when the demographic context of reception is taken into account. The analysis underscores that patterns of marital assimilation among Hispanics are neither monolithic nor expressed uniformly across geographic space.

Yet, the role of environmental factors in modifying the effect of acculturation on health behaviours has received little attention. This study aims to create a more nuanced understanding of the health effects of acculturation by examining how neighbourhood immigrant composition modifies the association between individuals' eating patterns and acculturation. Methods: Cross-sectional Data from Los Angeles County Health Survey 2007 adult sample were linked to data on retail food establishments and US Census 2000 neighbourhood characteristics. Acculturation was measured by language spoken at home and years stayed in the US. Eating fast food more than once per week and eating zero serving of fruit or vegetables during the previous day were used as proxy indicators for unhealthy dietary behaviour. Multilevel logistic regression models were performed in the full sample and in the sample with only Latino adults. Results: Immigrants' lack of acculturation and living in a neighbourhood with a high percentage immigrants were associated with healthier dietary behaviour. We also identified that lack of acculturation conveyed a significantly stronger protective effect on regular fast-food consumption for immigrants living in neighbourhoods with higher percentage immigrants (OR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.93). Conclusions: Among immigrants in Los Angeles County, living in a neighbourhood with a high density of other immigrants attenuates the negative effects of acculturation on healthy eating behaviours. Healthy eating promotion efforts should build on this protective effect in outreach to acculturating immigrant communities.

In our study, we explored whether acculturation and dyadic mutuality, as perceived by Mexican American family caregivers, explain the caregivers’ expectations of family loyalty toward elderly relatives. Design: A nonexperimental, correlational design with convenience sampling was used in El Paso, Texas, from October 2007 to January 2008. Methods: Three bilingual promotoras collected data from 193 Mexican American adult caregivers of community‐dwelling elders using three scales designed for Mexican Americans: the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans II‐Short Form, the Mutuality Scale, and the Expectations of Family Loyalty of Children Toward Elderly Relatives Scale. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to analyze the data. Findings: Acculturation had a marginal effect (r = .21, p < .05), but mutuality presented a strong correlation (r = .45, p < .001) with the expectations of family loyalty toward elderly relatives. There was no significant correlation between acculturation and mutuality (r = .05). Conclusions: Although Mexican American caregivers with strong Mexican orientation may have high expectations of family loyalty toward elderly relatives, mutuality exhibits more significant effects on expectations. Among Mexican Americans, mutuality between the caregiving dyad, as perceived by caregivers, may be a better predictor of filial values than caregivers’ acculturation alone. Clinical Relevance: It may be useful to incorporate the dual paradigm of acculturation and mutuality into immigrant family care for elderly relatives.

Statistically significant correlations were found between intergenerational transmission of attachment patterns among mothers and daughters and their levels of intimacy and conflict with each other. Nearly two thirds of secure mothers had secure daughters. Similarly, approximately two thirds of insecure mothers had insecure daughters. Secure mothers and daughters reported more intimacy and less conflict while insecure mothers and daughters reported less intimacy and more conflict in their relationship with each other.

This study examined the association of ethnic drinking culture, acculturation, and enculturation with alcohol drinking among male immigrants in Taiwan. This cross-sectional survey recruited 188 male immigrants. Ethnic drinking culture was divided into dry and wet according to per capita alcohol consumption and abstinent rate in the countries of origin in reference to that in Taiwan. A scale, Bidimensional Acculturation Scale for Marriage-Based Immigrants, was developed to measure acculturation (adaptation to the host culture) and enculturation (maintenance of the original culture). Drinking patterns (abstinent, low-risk drinking, and hazardous drinking) were determined by scores on the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test. There was a significant interaction between ethnic drinking culture and enculturation/acculturation on drinking patterns. Multinomial logistic regression models identified that for those from dry ethnic drinking cultures, a high level of acculturation was associated with increased low-risk drinking, while a high level of enculturation was associated with decreased low-risk drinking. For those from wet ethnic drinking cultures, a low level of acculturation and high level of enculturation were associated with increased hazardous drinking. High family socioeconomic status was associated with increased drinking, while perceived insufficient family income was positively associated with hazardous use. To prevent hazardous use of alcohol, health education should be targeted at immigrant men who drink, especially among those who have economic problems, are from wet ethnic drinking cultures, and demonstrate low adaptation to the host culture.

To explore these diverse Latina/o adolescent experiences this dissertation cross-culturally compares patterns of ethnic identity and acculturation across a group of Indigenous (Yucatec Maya) immigrant Latino/a adolescents in the U.S. with Yucatec Maya adolescents residing in Mexico and with non-Indigenous immigrant Latina/o adolescents in the U.S.How do ethnic identity, acculturation levels, perceived discrimination, and sense of school belonging compare across Yucatec Maya adolescents in the U.S., non-Yucatec Maya Latina/o adolescents in the U.S., and Yucatec Maya adolescents still in Mexico? What roles do individual factors such as gender, language, generation level, and external factors such as family, cultural practices, ethnic community networks, and peer relationships take in the adolescents' lives in the U.S. and in Yucatan? The study draws on ethnic identity and acculturation frameworks as they relate to perceived discrimination (the study of how the person targeted by discrimination reacts and interprets these acts) and to the adolescents' feelings of belonging at school. The participants included 65 Latina/o non-Yucatec Maya heritage adolescents living in the Los Angeles, California area, 66 Mexican Maya heritage immigrant adolescents living in San Francisco, California or the Los Angeles, California area, and 70 Mexican Maya heritage adolescents living in Yucatan, Mexico. All 201 adolescents took a survey incorporating measures of ethnic identity, acculturation, perceived discrimination, and school belonging. Thirty-eight of the adolescents participated in semi-structured interviews that explored attitudes toward school, culture, discrimination, family, community, and peers influencing the adolescents.Quantitative findings expose the intra-group differences across Yucatec Maya and non-Yucatec Maya Latina/os adolescents and the discrimination faced by the growing population of Yucatec Maya adolescents within the Latino/a immigrant groups. Language, gender, and generation all play roles in the amount of peer and adult perceived discrimination experienced and the distress caused by perceived discrimination across Indigenous and non-Indigenous adolescents. The quantitative findings ultimately show that Indigenous adolescents have different psychological and cultural experiences when compared to non-Indigenous Latina/o adolescents. Being Yucatec Maya, first generation, male, and/or knowledgeable of Maya would put the adolescent at a higher risk of experiencing more perceived discrimination acts and distress. More perceived discrimination from adults also relates to adolescents in the U.S. (both Yucatec Maya and non-Yucatec Maya) resulting in lower levels of school belonging.The qualitative findings across the non-Yucatec Maya adolescents, Yucatec Maya adolescents in the U.S., and Yucatec Maya adolescents in Mexico reveal an in depth look at multiple perspectives surrounding cultural and ethnic identity, cultural practices, American culture, discrimination, school, family, and peers. Specifically for the Yucatec Maya adolescents, the interviews provided a lens into their sentiments about the Maya culture and preserving the culture for future generations. The interviews reflect the agency, reclamation of culture, and lived experiences that make up the Indigenous and non-Indigenous adolescents of this study. The study exposes the Yucatec Maya youth's resilient Indigenous identity that emerges regardless of the discrimination they face from non-Latina/o/non-Mexican groups as well as from their own Latina/o/Mexican communities. This understanding is needed to provide more comprehensive resources and services to these adolescents.

We present two studies. In the first study, we found a negative correlation between adhesion to assimilation or secularism and in-group liking: the more immigrants preferred these ideologies, the less they displayed a positive evaluation of Moroccan people. No significant correlation was noticed between citizenship or multiculturalism and in-group liking. In contrast, adhesion to each one of the acculturation ideologies correlated positively with out-group liking. In the second study, we experimentally manipulated the acculturation ideologies and we showed that in-group liking was lower in assimilation and secularism conditions compared to citizenship and multiculturalism conditions. Out-group liking did not differ as a function of the acculturation ideology. The effect of acculturation ideologies on group evaluations was mediated by perception of the legitimacy of the acculturation ideologies. We discuss these results in terms of individual mobility.

This study examines the impact of acculturation, measured as English ability, along with other predictors on health for older Asian Americans. Data Sources: Data from the 2009 American Community Survey and the National Latino and Asian American Study were used to examine large-scale population characteristics of Asian American elderly. Measures: A broad view of health (physical, mental, Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (iADLs)) was examined using items capturing functional disability. Psychological health was examined using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Analytical Methods: Confirmatory factor analysis, logistic regression analysis, and path analysis was conducted. Results: CFA suggests scales are reliable for use. Cross-cultural comparability was found for psychological distress, but not for functional disability. Results indicated that English ability predicted lower disability, but had no relationship to psychological distress. Higher levels of intergenerational family conflict increased distress for Asian elders. Perceived discrimination, which represents a form of social marginalization, emerged as a key mediating variable and was consistently associated with poorer mental health. Conclusion: This study provided key insights into the applicability and measurement invariance of two key measures of health for older Asian Americans. While the measures captured health reasonably well, the results suggest confounds for this population, which may be due to perceptions of disability, language, immigration status, social networks, health insurance status, and access to services. Acculturation is a process involving the individual and the family, and can cut across age groups and generations. Policies should emphasize the development of culturally-specific services for Asian American elders. The study highlights that social workers must engage families across generations and the lifespan when working with Asian elders.

However, measures of degree of adjustment do not capture the breadth of strategies expatriates may use to achieve such adjustment, which may be critical for understanding whether expatriates have achieved a healthy and productive orientation to life abroad. Borrowing from research on immigrant populations, this study examines the construct of expatriate acculturation strategies, which characterize expatriates' mode of adjustment along two independent dimensions reflecting maintenance of one's home culture and engagement of the host culture, respectively. One hundred U.S. expatriates were recruited and completed an index of acculturation strategies. In addition, participants completed survey and reaction-time based measures of proposed antecedents, correlates, and outcomes of varying acculturation strategies. Results suggest that expatriates largely pursue either a maintenance-focused or engagement-focused strategy and that acculturation strategies are not redundant with degree of adjustment. Relationships between acculturation strategies and relevant individual differences, characteristics of expatriate positions, and outcomes are discussed.

Further, their investigation of whether earlier or contemporaneous experiences of discrimination influenced developmental outcomes in middle adolescence indicated differential effects, with contemporaneous experiences of discrimination affecting socioemotional adjustment, whereas earlier discrimination was more influential for academic performance. Finally, they found a persistent negative effect of acculturation on the link between discrimination and adolescents’ developmental outcomes, such that those adolescents who were more acculturated (in this case, higher in American orientation) experienced more deleterious effects of discrimination on both socioemotional and academic outcomes.

Despite its prevalence, the relationship with one’s nation has not been investigated empirically in terms of an attachment theory framework. Two studies employed an attachment theory approach to investigate the construct validity of symbolic attachment to one’s nation of origin, and its association with acculturation (operationalized as heritage and mainstream culture identification). Results for Study 1 indicated a three-factor structure of nation attachment; the factors were labelled secure-preoccupied, fearful, and dismissive nation attachment. Hierarchical linear modelling was employed to control for differing cultures across participants. Secure-preoccupied nation attachment was a significant predictor of increased heritage culture identification for participants residing in their country of birth, whilst dismissive nation attachment was a significant predictor of decreased heritage culture identification for international migrants. Secure-preoccupied nation attachment was also associated with higher levels of subjective-wellbeing. Study 2 further confirmed the validity of the nation attachment construct through confirmatory factor analysis; the three-factor model adequately fit the data. Similar to the results of Study 1, secure-preoccupied nation attachment was associated with increased levels of heritage culture identification and psychological well-being. Implications of the tripartite model of nation attachment for identity and well-being will be discussed.

Methods: A community-based participatory research framework was used through all phases of this study. Standard as well as community-developed measures of acculturation were used. Data were obtained by face-to-face and telephone interviews with 1,628 respondents from July 2006 to March 2007. Results: Vietnamese and Cambodian men smoke at higher rates than men in the U.S. general population (35% and 58% compared with 20%, respectively). Most men across the Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Lao populations started smoking prior to immigration to the United States, although most former smokers quit smoking after immigration to the United States. Most male Hmong respondents started smoking after immigration. Education was predictive of smoking status across genders, with less education associated with greater odds of being a smoker. Logistic regression found some acculturation measures to be predictive of smoking status across both genders: Less acculturated male respondents and more acculturated female respondents are more likely to be smokers. Discussion: Results of this study suggest that the role of acculturation in tobacco use may not be straightforward as has been presented previously. Other factors, such as social norms and cultural or linguistic isolation, may also be playing a role in tobacco use patterns and may play different roles for different subgroups. Further research is needed within each population and subgroups within those populations to understand these relationships and how they affect smoking behavior.

The present study had three sub-hypotheses. The first proposed that participant's who had experienced negative psychological distress/family dysfunction, were more likely to major in Psychology than Criminology. The second sub-hypothesis proposed that Latino men were more likely to choose Criminology, whereas Latino women were more likely to choose psychology due to their increased ability to demonstrate empathy and listening skills. The third sub-hypothesis proposed that participants with an internal locus of control were more likely to enter a psychology degree than a criminology degree. The recruitment included a total of 228 participants. Fifty-five percent of participants were recruited from the Psychology Department at the state university, and the remaining participants were recruited from several programs that support Hispanic and Latino students and/or migrant students. Participants were asked to complete a Demographic Questionnaire, the Bidimensional Acculturation Scale for Hispanics (BAS), the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), the Multi-Dimensional Emotional Empathy Scale, and the Locus of Control Scale. A logistic regression analysis revealed that acculturation and empathy were best predictors of predictive of major choices. Overall, bicultural students are 4.4 times more likely than acculturated students to be Criminology majors. Furthermore, lower empathy scores are significantly associated with a criminology career choice over psychology. For each one unit decrease in empathy score, the likelihood of choosing Criminology major is 5.37 times higher than choosing a Psychology major. Psychological/family distress, gender, and locus of control were hypothesized to be predictors of career choice, but did not significantly contribute to the logistic regression model.

Methods: Data come from EAT 2010, a population-based study of weight and related behaviors (N = 1577, mean age = 14.5 years). Adjusted models tested associations between weight-based teasing and well-being, controlling for BMI and ethnic group; effect modification by ethnic group and acculturation were also explored. Results: Family weight-based teasing was common (12.1%–42.9% reporting this experience across gender and ethnic groups) and was associated with all four measures of well-being in the expected direction. Associations were statistically equivalent in all ethnic groups and were not modified by acculturation. Conclusion: Youth from immigrant communities experience family weight-based teasing and associated threats to well-being. Additional research is needed to further understand the cultural context of weight-based teasing and develop relevant prevention messages.

In the current research, we test the prediction that high-quality interactions with majority others, in which minorities feel accepted, increase the likelihood of emotional fit. We also explore whether this prediction holds true for both positive and negative interactions with majority. To test this prediction, we conducted a 7-day daily diary study with minority students in Belgian middle schools (N = 117). Each day, participants reported one positive and one negative interaction at school. They subsequently evaluated each interaction (e.g., felt accepted), assessed their relationship with the interaction partner (e.g., our relationship is important to me), and rated their emotions. Analyses focused on the interactions with Belgian majority interaction partners. Emotional acculturation was computed for positive and negative interactions separately, by calculating the fit between the emotional pattern of the minority student and the average emotional pattern of a sample of majority participants (N = 106) who also took part in the daily diary. As predicted, we found higher emotional fit in positive interactions when immigrant minorities felt accepted by the interaction partner. In contrast to this finding for positive interactions, emotional fit for negative interactions was higher when minorities felt excluded by the interaction partner. Further analyses on the negative interactions suggested that minority adolescents felt more negative autonomy-promoting emotions (e.g., anger and frustration) when they perceived being excluded. Given that Belgian majority youth feel more autonomy-promoting emotions generally, minorities’ fit with majority patterns was higher. The results confirm our hypothesis that minorities’ fit with majority emotions is contingent on the quality of their interactions with majority, even if in negative interactions, high-quality interactions produced less rather than more emotional fit. Our findings suggest that emotional acculturation is not just a ‘skill’ that minority individuals acquire, but also a response to the ways in which interactions with majority others develop. Inclusive interactions, especially when they are positive, appear to align immigrant minority individuals with the majority norm.

Because the Philippines is the second largest source of immigrants to the United States, studying Filipinos' processes of acculturation is important as acculturation can result in Filipinos experiencing intergenerational conflict, marital discord, adjustment disorders, racism, and shifts in traditional gender roles. Because female ethnic minorities are doubly stigmatized for their race as well as their gender, this study investigated aspects of the Filipina experience. More precisely, Filipinas' level of acculturation was examined in relation to their attitudes toward women's gender roles. One hundred twenty-one Filipinas from the San Francisco Bay Area completed a demographic questionnaire, the Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identity Acculturation Scale (SL-ASIA) that measures behavioral acculturation, the Asian Values Scale (AVS) that measures adherence to Asian values, the Sex Role Orientation Scale (SRO) that measures attitudes toward women's roles, and 2 open-ended questions. Hypotheses were tested using Pearson's r correlations and a stepwise regression. Results indicated that adherence to Asian values and participants' age at immigration to the United States were significant predictors of attitudes toward women's roles. Both behavioral acculturation and adherence to Asian values were significantly correlated with attitudes toward women's roles. In addition, participants who were more behaviorally acculturated were significantly less likely to adhere to Asian values. Furthermore, participants were significantly more likely to have nontraditional attitudes toward women's roles if they had high incomes, were more educated, spoke more English at home, and were born in the United States. Limitations of this study and implications for future research are also discussed.

What constitute flourishing life among them? This cross-sectional, survey study focused on the role of social capital and acculturation to American society on flourishing among the purposive sample of Japanese immigrants and sojourners living in Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, USA. A total of 380 cases were used to test the hypothetical model of flourishing through structural equation modeling. The majority of the participants was female, in their 30s and 40s, married, fairly high socioeconomic status, and employed. The average lengths of stay in the United States were almost 10 years. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that all the measurement models of flourishing, social capital, and acculturation to American society were reliable and valid with no or a few modifications. The MIMIC model was not included in the final model because of its poor fit (the CFI = .887, the TLI = .830, the RMSEA = .143, χ2 = 122.28, df = 14, p < .05). The final full structural model yielded an adequate fit (the CFI = .921, the TLI = .906, the RMSEA = .067, χ2 = 345.48, df = 128, p < .05). Among the sample of Japanese immigrants, demographic variables, including gender, English proficiency, and lengths of stay in the United States were not associated with flourishing. Those with higher social capital were more likely to experience higher acculturation to American society (β = .531, p < .05) as well as flourishing (β = .494, p < .05). Higher acculturation to American society predicted higher flourishing (β = .264, p < .05). The intervening effect of acculturation was found in the relationship between social capital and flourishing. That is, those with higher social capital were more likely to be acculturated to American society, in turn, experienced higher flourishing. The positive approach is useful in understanding immigrant and sojourner adaptation because it takes a person-in-environment perspective that values the effect of social interactions on individuals’ optimal wellbeing. The findings of the study yielded several important implications for social workers working with immigrants and sojourners. Social workers can promote wellbeing by helping them strengthen their existing social ties and to create new relationships that are mediated by both face-to-face and online contacts. Expanded social capital will enhance better acculturation to American society, which encourages better flourishing among Japanese immigrants and sojourners. For ever-growing global society, it is of great importance to examine immigration as positive experiences for both immigrants and the nation that welcomes them.

Results from a web-based survey.",1,NA,"Background. Due to the fast development of economies in China and the great needs of professionals in the US, the population of highly educated young Chinese professionals working in high-tech industries has grown very fast in both countries. This population was suggested to have risk of consuming high energy and fat diet in both countries. Objectives. This study aimed to investigate the associations of dietary intake with nutrition knowledge, attitude, dietary self-efficacy and acculturation among Chinese working in high-tech industries in China and in the US. Methods. This study was a cross-sectional self-administered online survey. We studied 925 Chinese aged 20-45 years, who worked in high-tech industries and had at least a bachelor degree in four sub-groups: employees of Chinese companies in China; employees of American companies in China; Chinese-born immigrant in the US; and American-born Chinese in the US. A web-based questionnaire including a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was developed to assess total energy and fat intakes, nutrition knowledge, attitudes, dietary self-efficacy. Four domains of acculturation were assessed among Chinese in the US. Using these data, we compared the four sub-groups and tested the prediction model of dietary intake and BMI. Results. Our results showed that American-born Chinese participants consumed significantly higher energy and fat than the other three groups. Participants in the US had higher nutrition knowledge, attitude and self-efficacy than participants in China. Chinese-born immigrant men in the US had the highest nutrition knowledge and attitude and the lowest prevalence of overweight among the four study groups of men. The study results suggested that preferring Chinese food and Chinese leisure activity are predictors of lower energy and fat intake in Chinese-born immigrants. Conclusions. The Chinese-born immigrants showed significant advantages in nutrition knowledge, attitude, and dietary self-efficacy and had the lowest prevalence of overweight in men. American-born Chinese consumed the highest energy and fat among the four study groups even though their nutrition knowledge, attitude and self-efficacy were high. Future nutrition promotion programs should make use of these cultural and environmental differences when designing theses programs. The web-based survey method can be utilized in future nutrition research.

In particular, it is focused on the perceptions of Mexican immigrant and Mexican American women regarding the social services available to them (Tiefenthaler, Farmer, & Sambira, 2005).

The measures of social integration (AOR = 1.14(95 % CI 1.09, 1.20) female; AOR = 1.12 (95 %CI 1.05, 1.19) male) and legal-income status (AOR = 1.12 (95 % CI 1.07, 1.18) female; AOR = 1.31 (95 %CI 1.20, 1.42) male) were positively related to the odds of reporting an HIV test for both male and female migrants. Exposure to AIDS programming including attending an AIDS meeting and possessing AIDS knowledge was also related to an increase in HIV testing. In addition, reproductive health factors including sexual risk behavior and childbirth increased the rate of HIV testing.

"369","Search2021","thesis",2018,"Ekmanis, Indra Dineh","Host land or homeland?: Civic-cultural identity and banal integration in Latvia.",1,NA,"This dissertation challenges conventional approaches in the study of minority integration by looking at the spaces in which integration occurs, rather than at instances of conflict. It develops a framework that considers banal manifestations of social integration in quotidian and national life. Concentrating on the case study of Russian-speakers and ethnic titulars in Latvia, it compares top-down, elite-led discourse on integration with lived interethnic interactions. In many conventional analyses, Latvia is considered a divided society wherein ethnic, linguistic, and cultural cleavages separate ethnic Latvians from the proportionally large population of Russian-speakers 'left behind' when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. This population has been analyzed through immigrant, diaspora, and fifth column frameworks that suggest Russian speakers remain outside of the Latvian state and nation, if not always civically, then certainly culturally. This dissertation argues the frameworks and indicators traditionally used to measure integration do not sufficiently consider integration in everyday experiences, and therefore overlook much of the integration that is occurring on the ground. Rather, banality -- or the lived experiences that fade into the hum of everyday life -- is an indicator of significant interpersonal and socio-national integration that incorporates minorities as active members of the nation. The dissertation considers relevant theories in the study of integration, nationalism, and identity to create frameworks of interpersonal and socio-national banal integration. These capture both person-to-person experiences and minority engagement with society and the state. The dissertation then links the theoretical concept with three critical elements in the Latvian integration debate. First, it notes the disconnect between top-down integration priorities and ground-level realities. Second, it examines banal integration in daily life, looking at interpersonal interactions, public spaces, and civic connections with the state. Finally, the dissertation considers the ways in which minorities engage as embedded members of the Latvian nation, looking at participation in cultural events and national holidays. Theoretically, this dissertation highlights the necessity of prioritizing banal, quotidian experiences over elite-led discourse in the study of integration. Methodologically, it accomplishes this goal through a multi-method approach, using extant document summary and analysis, medium-n survey data, and qualitative ethnography. Empirically, the dissertation pushes back against a narrative of conflict in Latvian and Russian-speaker relations. Indeed, it argues that not only is Latvian society far less divided than it discursively appears, in many cases, minorities see themselves as active members of the Latvian cultural and civic nation, not tangential to it. This dissertation is a dedicated analysis of the Latvian case, but contributes more broadly to the literature on post-Soviet diaspora and migration studies, integration studies, and questions of nationalism and identity in the modern global context.

The current study examines immigrant intentions to leave the host country, but not necessarily to return to the homeland. The predictive model, which focuses on immigrant subjective identity, was tested through a survey of 338 first and 1.5 generation Former Soviet Union (FSU) immigrants in Israel, who applied to a prominent NGO to obtain proof of their Jewishness. These individuals are from the largest recent immigrant group in Israel, and are highly represented among the young adult (aged 25–40) immigrants leaving Israel. The findings indicate that contrary to our expectations, Israeli local identity did not have a significant effect on the immigrants’ intentions to leave Israel. By contrast, Jewish identity and level of religiosity did play a significant role in attenuating the immigrant’s tendency to leave. This paper highlights the complex relationship between ethnic identities and religiosity among immigrants in general, and in Israel in particular.

I use data from a 2009–2010 Internet survey into which I incorporated country‐contextual characteristics. The results of multivariate analyses show that a social integration combining duration of residence abroad and local citizenship enhances religio‐ethnic identification. Another measure of integration, social networks, deters group behaviors. All measures of general integration inhibit attachment to the home country, whereas religio‐ethnic acculturation is largely insignificant for transnationalism. The religiosity of the new country does not influence immigrants’ religio‐ethnic patterns or homeland attachment. Insofar as group size is a significant determinant of particularistic behaviors, it weakens them. The more policy‐based opportunities newcomers receive, the more they dissociate from group behaviors and homeland ties. Irrespective of individual and contextual factors, living in the United States encourages group affiliation more than living in Europe does. The results are discussed in reference to four working hypotheses—marginalization, integration, assimilation, and separation—and from a U.S.‐European comparative perspective.

The present study examined the relationships between immigration status, language spoken at home, and dating violence experienced by Hispanic adolescent girls in New Mexico. Data from the 2007 New Mexico Youth Risk and Resiliency Surveys were analyzed. Adjusted logistic regression analyses were conducted among the full sample of Hispanic females (N = 3,412) and among strata based on immigration status. Immigrant Hispanic girls were as likely as non-immigrant Hispanic girls to have experienced dating violence in the prior year (P = 0.93). Among immigrant Hispanic girls, those who were Non-English-dominant were one-fourth as likely to have experienced dating violence as those immigrant girls who were English-dominant (aOR 0.27 [95% CI 0.08-0.87]). Among US-born Hispanic girls, those who were Non-English-dominant were less likely to have experienced dating violence; however, this value did not reach statistical significance (aOR 0.65 [95% CI 0.33-1.27]). Past sexual experience was a significant risk factor for dating violence for US-born Hispanic girls (aOR 4.99 [95% CI 3.18-7.83]) but not for immigrant Hispanic girls (aOR 1.66 [95% CI 0.63-4.43]). Immigrant status was not found to be protective against dating violence for New Mexico Hispanic girls. However, those immigrant girls who were less acculturated in terms of language used at home were found to have only a quarter of the risk of dating violence as those more acculturated. The use of heritage language by immigrant Hispanic girls may be a protective factor against dating violence. Further studies are indicated to confirm this finding.

It explores the phenomenon known as the 'immigrant paradox,' whereby early generation adolescents exhibit more positive academic outcomes than their later generation peers, and tests whether the immigrant paradox can be explained via the processes of acculturation, ethnic identity, family obligation, cultural values like familismo, and belief in the American Dream. Using a mixed methods design, the study also investigates how family immigration and education stories impact the belief in the American Dream and educational beliefs and values. The quantitative study uses self-report survey data from 223 Latino 9th graders (and a subset of 135 Dominican 9 th graders) to investigate the presence of the 'immigrant paradox' and the underlying processes which may explain the impact of acculturation on academic outcomes. Findings from this study provide evidence for the 'immigrant paradox' in both the full sample as well as the Dominican subset. Furthermore, family obligation was found to have a significant positive effect on academic attitudes, and both familismo and belief in the American Dream were found to moderate the impact of acculturation on academic outcomes. These findings point to the importance of family processes and cultural values in motivating children of immigrants and later generation peers to succeed academically. The qualitative study continues to explore these relations by reviewing the family immigration and education stories of a subset of the 223 students. Students who reported family members immigrating to the U.S. to improve the lives of the next generation were more likely to believe in the American Dream. Family stories of positive educational experiences were positively related to adolescents' beliefs about the value of education, while family stories of negative peer interactions were negatively related to adolescents' beliefs about the value of education. Family stories of family-related school struggles were significantly related to greater academic efficacy. Findings from the qualitative study illustrate the potential motivational role of family stories on Latino adolescent educational beliefs and values and support the important influence of family factors on academic attitudes found in the quantitative study.

Aims of the study: To investigate the relationship between social integration and psychological distress in immigrants in Oslo, Norway, with focus on gender differences. Methods: The study was based on data from a community survey in Oslo (N = 15899), and included 1448 immigrants from non-Western and 1059 immigrants from Western countries. Psychological distress was measured by a 10 items version of Hopkins Symptom Check List (HSCL-10), and social integration was measured by an index based on four items: Knowledge of the Norwegian language, reading Norwegian newspapers, visits by Norwegians and receiving help from Norwegians. Information on paid employment, household income, marital status, social support and conflicts in intimate relationships was also included in the study. Results: The non-western immigrants showed a higher level of psychological distress than the immigrants from western countries. In men this could be explained by the combination of less social integration, less employment, lower income, less social support and more conflicts in intimate relationships among non-western compared to western immigrants. In women the difference in level of psychological stress could not be explained by these variables, even if it was reduced. A reason for this seemed to be that social integration in non-western immigrants had a different effect on mental health in men and women. In men, social integration showed a positive effect through employment and income, as well as a positive effect in other areas. Also in non-western women social integration showed a positive effect through greater access to employment and income, but this effect was leveled out by integration causing problems in other areas. Conclusion: Unexpectedly, social integration in non-western immigrants was associated with good mental health in men, but not in women. A possible explanation for this might be that the traditional female role in these countries is more challenged by social integration into a Western country than the male role, resulting in conflicting norms, threat to the self and/or loss of identity.

It was hypothesized that social connectedness in ethnic and mainstream society is a stronger predictor of well-being to immigrants who highly value/desire it than to those who do not. The results from hierarchical multiple regression analyses provided partial support for the hypotheses.

After adjustment for potential confounders, current smoking prevalence was higher and the quit rate was lower for Korean, Filipino, and Vietnamese American men compared with Chinese American men. Women's current smoking prevalence was lower than men's in all six Asian American subgroups. South Asian and Korean American women reported lower quit rates than women from other ethnic subgroups. Asian American men who reported using only English at home had lower current smoking prevalence and higher quit rates, except for Filipino and South Asian American men. Asian American women who reported using only English at home had higher current smoking prevalence except for Japanese women. Being a second or later generation immigrant was associated with lower smoking prevalence among all Asian American subgroups of men. Less educated men and women had higher smoking prevalence and lower quit rates. In conclusion, both current smoking prevalence and quit rates vary distinctively across gender and ethnic subgroups among Asian Americans in California. Acculturation appears to increase the risk of cigarette smoking for Asian American women. Future tobacco-control programs should target at high-risk Asian American subgroups, defined by ethnicity, acculturation status, and gender.

We argue that migrants’ initial self-reported mainstream cultural orientation constitutes an important antecedent of early social participation in the new community. Results from two longitudinal studies of newly arrived international students (N = 98 and N = 60) show that more positive initial mainstream cultural orientations prospectively predict higher social participation, specifically in the mainstream group, over the following months. This relation held after controlling for important alternative predictors, namely, extraversion/shyness, mainstream language proficiency, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia, a physiological index of social engagement capacity. These studies focus on the very initial stages of the temporal dynamics of acculturation, contribute to bridging research on acculturation and on intergroup relations, and establish a link between cultural orientations, a subjective attitudinal construct, and concrete social engagement behaviors.

I address this problem by examining the question: does incorporation in settlement countries reduce support for conflict ideology? Examining this question requires new microdata. I examine the results of a large-scale survey of ex-Yugoslavs in Sweden. The findings suggest that incorporation undermines support for conflict ideology by increasing the socioeconomic security and social identity complexity of migrants.

The sample included 218 Ukrainian immigrants with an average of 39 years. The average length of time residing in Portugal was 10 years. As regards the integration hypothesis, psychological adaptation and intercultural adaptation were predicted by integration, while sociocultural adaptation was only predicted by marginalization. Thus, the integration hypothesis was partially supported for Ukrainian immigrants living in Portugal. The contact hypothesis tended to be supported, as intercultural contact was predicted by higher positive attitudes toward Portuguese, and assimilation. However, integration has not emerged as a significant predictor of intercultural contact. This sample displayed a relatively low level of perceived discrimination. In line with the multiculturalism hypothesis, perceived discrimination was negatively related to tolerance, attitude towards Portuguese, attitude towards other immigrants, and positively related to preference for separation and marginalization.

More importantly, differences in Internet usage are found to have a significant impact on immigrants’ intercultural adaptation. In an online environment, the social communication in the host country is a critical component that can facilitate or impede immigrants’ successful adaptation to the host country, whereas ethnic social communication also plays a role at the initial stage of transition.

Further, the influence of immigrant status, Anglo orientation, Latino orientation, and the interaction of immigrant status and acculturation variables on IPV were examined. Data came from the Sexual Assault Among Latinas (SALAS) study that gathered data from a national sample of Latino women (N = 2,000) via telephone interviews. Results showed 15.6 % of Latino women experienced IPV in their lifetime and threat IPV was the most common form of IPV. Physical, sexual, stalking and threat IPV were all used as abusive tactics in various configurations. Logistic regression analyses showed immigrants were less likely than U.S. born Latino women to experience any IPV and physical IPV. Anglo orientation was associated with increased odds of any IPV and stalking IPV while Latino orientation was associated with decreased odds of all forms of IPV. Furthermore, the protective effect of Latino orientation for stalking IPV was pronounced among immigrants. Together the results show that 1 in 6 Latino women experience IPV and that sociocultural factors such as immigrant status and acculturation are important considerations for this group, underscoring the influence of migration and cultural adaptation to family functioning.

The study findings revealed that biculturalism was the most preferred acculturation mode across countries and within most of the countries. Biculturalism was positively related to two out of three psychological adaptation measures and one out of two sociocultural adaptation measures across and within most participating countries. The pattern of relationship remained true after controlling for perceived discrimination in the analyses.

Previous research suggests immigrant children have reduced risk for injury, but the reason for that finding remains unknown. One leading hypothesis is cultural—less acculturated children in the United States appear to be protected from injury—but the combined influence of immigrant status and acculturation is unclear. This study examines the roles of immigration and language acculturation on pediatric injury risk. Samples of 8,526 children and 4,010 adolescents included in the 2003 California Health Interview Survey were studied. The primary analytic technique was Poisson regressions predicting incidents of injury requiring professional medical attention. Predictor variables included demographic characteristics, health insurance availability, birthplace (US vs. other), and language acculturation. Both birthplace and language acculturation were related to children’s and to adolescent’s risk for unintentional injury, but language acculturation emerged as the stronger univariate predictor and only multivariate predictor of injury in both models.

"396","Search2021","thesis",2019,"Roth, Kimberly B.","Latinos' experiences in the US: Acculturation, discrimination, stress, social cohesion and psychiatric disorder.",1,NA,"Background: Latinos are the largest foreign-born group and one of the fastest growing minority groups in the United States. As such, they will increasingly contribute to the burden of mental and behavioral disorders. Acculturation and other related experiences are associated with the development of mental disorder in US-residing Latinos, however most studies treat Latinos as a homogeneous group. This obscures meaningful between-group differences and hinders the elucidation of potential mechanisms contributing to the association between acculturation and mental health outcomes. Further, despite its importance, acculturation has been measured insufficiently and inconsistently. This is especially problematic due to the complex nature of these constructs. To understand the mechanism by which acculturation impacts mental health, novel methods are needed. Latent variable methods are one such approach that has been recommended as a way to capture nuance of complex constructs such as acculturation. Methods: Data come from the National Latino and Asian American Study, a nationally-representative, cross-sectional survey of 2,554 Latinos in the United States. Results: The six scales of acculturation (English and Spanish language preference and proficiency, ethnic identity) and related experiences (discrimination, acculturative stress, neighborhood context, family context) had good construct validity. No scales achieved full measurement invariance, but some scales were more variant across subgroups than others. Four latent classes of Latinos' acculturative experiences emerged: Positive Experiences (n=1,743, 69%), Cohesive-Conflict (n=424, 17%), Marginalized Conflict (n=237, 9%), and Marginalized (n=137, 5%). These classes were highly associated with all three categories of DSM-IV disorder: depressive, anxiety, and substance use disorders after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, subethnicity and generational status. The Positive Experiences class had the lowest lifetime prevalence of all three disorders (14.8%, 13.6% and 7.1%, respectively). The class associated with the highest disorder prevalence (34.0%, 26.6%, and 22.5%, respectively) was those Latinos with a Marginalized Conflict experience. After accounting for acculturative experiences, direct associations between subethnicity and generational status and disorder varied. There were no significant direct effects between subethnicity and substance use disorder prevalence, but a strong dose-response relationship of generational status. Conversely, subethnicity was directly related to depressive and anxiety disorder prevalence, but generational status was not. Conclusions: Acculturation and other experiences related to immigrant and minority status in the US are complex constructs and should be treated as such. Latent variable methods help account for measurement variance by subgroup and the unobserved nature of the constructs. Latinos have varied acculturative experiences in the US, which are highly personal and not fully accounted for by observed characteristics such as country of origin.

It is argued that the values, beliefs, and ultimate concerns of these young immigrants have been the underlying forces behind their efforts in adjusting to the challenges in a strange land. Of particular importance are contentment and gratitude, a strong family concept, 'face', an urge for knowledge, a sense of crisis, faith in life, and the identity of a marginal man. These themes reflect the importance of cultural values in shaping migration behaviors.

The self-esteem of Hispanic adolescents who were less linguistically acculturated was found to be more favorable when with family than with friends and the reverse was found for the more linguistically acculturated participants.

Findings underscore the need to better understand the complex process of linguistic acculturation and its effects on self-esteem.

We investigated the longitudinal relationship between three domains of acculturation (traditionalism, biculturalism, assimilation) and alcohol use among 302 Vietnamese and Cambodian women in Washington State. Methods: Data were obtained from the Cross Cultural Families Project (CCF), a 5-year longitudinal investigation of a random sample of Vietnamese and Cambodian immigrant families living in Washington State. Alcohol use was measured with a three item scale assessing frequency and quantity of use, and binge drinking. Acculturation was measured with the Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identity Acculturation Scale. Linear mixed effects regression models were estimated to assess the impact of acculturation on alcohol use among the overall sample and among a sub-sample of only women who consumed any alcohol. Results: A majority of the sample, 73.2%, reported no alcohol use. In the overall sample, none of the three acculturation domains were significantly associated with drinking. Among a sub-sample of only those who reported any alcohol use, however, a greater degree of traditional cultural identification (β = −0.94, SE = 0.44, P = 0.03) and a greater degree of biculturalism (β = −1.33, SE = 0.53, P = 0.01) were associated with lower levels of use. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that acculturation did not impact alcohol use prevalence but that it did affect the drinking pattern among alcohol consumers. Clinicians should be cognizant that certain aspects of cultural identification are important contributors to drinking behavior among alcohol consumers in these populations.

However, length of time in the United States was not associated with depressive symptoms, ethnic culture immersion, or acculturative stress. Conclusions: Our results suggest that elevated depressive symptoms are related to acculturative stress but are not confined to the initial adjustment period. Steps to decrease acculturative stress might help decrease depressive symptoms in immigrants regardless of the number of years lived in the United States.

Findings show that trust in government in the new host nation is shaped by individuals’ premigratory exposure to democracy during preadult socialization in their countries of origin. Immigrants who were socialized under more democratic regimes exhibit less trust in the national government than do their counterparts socialized under authoritarian systems.

While immigrant adolescents are faced with the realities of 2 different cultures, they also have to master age-salient tasks, such as self-efficacy and identity development. To get a better insight into the interplay of developmental and acculturative tasks and their relationship with family functioning, we used 3-wave longitudinal data over a 2-year period from 13-year-old immigrant students (N = 609) in Athens, Greece. Cross-lagged models revealed that family functioning and acculturation were resources for the mastery of developmental tasks. Involvement in the host culture prospectively predicted self-efficacy beliefs, and involvement in the ethnic culture prospectively predicted ethnic identity. These effects increased over time. Family functioning prospectively predicted self-efficacy and ethnic identity. These effects decreased over time. The findings suggest that a well-functioning family, for early adolescents, and being involved in the host culture and in ethnic cultures, for middle adolescents, are particularly important resources to master the tasks of their developmental period.

Research on migrant health mostly examines labor migrants, with some attention paid to the trauma faced by refugees. Marriage migrants represent an understudied vulnerable population in the migration and health literature. Objectives. Drawing on a Social Determinants of Health (SDH) approach, we use a large Korean national survey and stratified multivariate regressions to examine the link between migration processes and the self-rated health of Korea's three largest ethnic groups of marriage migrants: Korean-Chinese, Vietnamese, and Han Chinese. Results. We find that post-migration socioeconomic status and several social integration factors are associated with the health of marriage migrants of all three groups. Specifically, having more social relationships with Koreans is associated with good health among marriage migrants, while having more social relationships with co-ethnics is associated with worse health. Marriage migrants' perceived social status of their natal and marital families is a better predictor of their health than more objective measures such as their education attainment and that of their Korean husbands. The post-migration social gradients among all ethnic groups demonstrate a dose-response effect of marital family's social standing on marriage migrants' health, independent of their own education and the social standing of their natal families. Lastly, we find some ethnicity-specific predictors such as the association between higher educational level and worse health status among the Vietnamese. This variability by group suggests a more complex set of SDH occurred during the marriage migration processes than a basic SDH framework would predict. Conclusion. Using a new immigrant destination, South Korea, as an example, we conclude that migration and health policies that reduce ethnicity-specific barriers and offer integration programs in early post-migration stages may offer a pathway to good health among marriage migrants.

Specifically, we were interested in the ways in which Jewish immigrant adolescents from the former Soviet Union integrate their Russian, Jewish, and American identities, and to what extent identification with these three cultures predicts adaptation to varied life domains. In order to examine whether being Jewish has an impact on salience and predictive value of Russian and American identities, a sample of Jewish adolescents (n = 100) was compared with a sample of non-Jewish (n = 113) adolescent immigrants from the former Soviet Union. The study suggests that Jewish and non-Jewish adolescent immigrants differ in levels of Russian and American identity. Further, using structural equation modeling a bicultural model for Jewish and non-Jewish adolescents was tested. The results suggest that these two groups do not differ with respect to how Russian and American identities impact on adjustment. However, adding Jewish identity to the model for the Jewish sample significantly improved model fit, and rendered some of the impact of Russian identity non-significant. Thus a multicultural model that included all three identities had better explanatory power for this sample than a bicultural one.

Based on survey data and quantitative analyses (general linear models), TPSOC and EPSOC were considered first separately and then combined, according to a bidimensional model of MPSOC that resulted in four combinations (dual membership, receiving society membership, ethnic membership, and no membership). The findings highlighted significant variations across groups. Among Albanian participants, both TPSOC and EPSOC were positively associated with integration and negatively with marginalization. Dual membership was positively associated with integration, prevailing ethnic membership with separation, and no membership with marginalization. Among Sri Lankan participants, EPSOC showed a positive association with separation. Dual membership was associated with marginalization, prevailing receiving society membership with assimilation, prevailing ethnic membership with separation, and no membership with integration.

Few studies have been directed toward the political dimension of refugee life. The empirical results show that North Korean women defectors hold generally participatory attitudes toward politics and mostly liberal opinions on policy issues. Furthermore, among the socio-demographic variables, age and marital status are generally influential in the intention of political participation among the North Korean women defectors. Among the political attitudinal variables, attitude toward environmental policy consistently affects political participation intention.

Bilingual telephone surveys were conducted from a probability sample (N = 590) in 2007. Lower acculturation significantly related to lower milk consumption for women during the age periods of 12–18 and 19–34 years. Acculturation was related to higher prevalence of osteoporosis among postmenopausal, but not pre-menopausal Korean women in California. Future research should include larger cohorts, objective measures of osteoporosis, other sources of calcium specific to Korean cuisine, and assessment of bone-loading physical activity.

In Study 1, surveys were administered to 56 participants to refine the scale. In Study 2, psychometric evaluation of cross-sectional data with 344 participants showed high reliability and validity. Exploratory factor analysis generated a three-factor explanation, which aligned with the hypothesized conceptual framework: ambiguous loss of homeland, satisfaction with the homeland, and satisfaction with the United States. A single scale, relative satisfaction was created by taking the difference between the two satisfaction factors. The PALH can be useful in understanding individuals’ psychological challenges with leaving their homeland and adjusting to life in a new country.

In this chapter, we propose that immigrants and minority members hold contextualized value systems relevant to the values of the country of residence and of the ethnic-group. We investigate the value priorities of countries (Israel and Germany) and of ethnic-groups (former Soviet Union immigrants, Arab citizens of Israel, Turkish immigrants). We examine the relations between these modal group values and the contextualized values of group members. Last, we examine the interaction between the contextualized values and acculturation strategies.

The psychosocial context of HIV risk included concerns expressed about lack of money and employment, followed by racism, social isolation, sadness and loneliness. High rates of alcohol use and binge drinking that co-occur with sexual activities were reported. While only 7% of MDLs reported illegal injection drug use, needles were frequently shared without bleach cleaning. Men generally did not carry condoms and knowledge of proper condom use was poor. For the most common form of sex reported, vaginal sex, condom use was infrequent. However, men did report confidence in being able to insist on condom use in challenging sexual situations, and they also reported fairly frequent pro-condom attitudes and behaviors within their social circles. Slightly over half of the men reported sexual activity with female partners, during the past 2 months. These female partners were almost evenly divided into regular sex partners, including spouses, and riskier partners such as one time only sex partners, prostitutes, and multiple sex partners. Results also indicated encouraging efforts by MDLs to reduce risk with risky partners (e.g., more condom use).

Data sources: Sixty women from local community settings were given the PPDS-S instrument and the General Acculturation Index to screen for PPD symptoms. Data were then compared with previously published community clinic data. Conclusion: Sixty percent of the immigrant Hispanic women showed significant PPD. The only statistically significant positive predictive factor for increased PPD symptoms was having a previous history of depression. In addition, 54% had an elevated symptom content profile score for suicidal thinking. Implications for practice: Health practitioners should be aware of a potentially high rate of PPD in this population, especially in light of previously studied increased rates of suicide attempts in Latinas. If a prior history of depression is predictive of PPD, it is possible that many of the mothers in our sample suffered from depression prior to the postpartum period, but were not appropriately diagnosed or treated. Recommendations for outreach and further research are discussed. In particular, further research regarding the prenatal prevalence of depression in immigrant Hispanic women is recommended in order to further understand the high incidence of PPD.

Hierarchical multiple regression was used to investigate the influence of: 1) attachment styles (pre-occupied, dismissive, secure, and fearful); 2) family relations (intergenerational conflict and family cohesion); 3) ethnic (belonging, centrality, and exploration) and national identities; and 4) interactions between the components of ethnic and national identity. Controlling for demographic factors, results indicated that a preoccupied attachment style and experiences of acculturative intergenerational conflict exacerbated EIC, whereas family cohesion, ethnic identity centrality, and ethnic group belonging protected against EIC.

If so, to what extent is this attributable to post-migration experiences, including discrimination? How does gender affect the relationships between post-migration experience and positive mental health? To address these questions, the current study uses data from Statistics Canada’s 2013 General Social Survey (GSS), a nationally representative household study that included 27,695 Canadians 15 years of age and older. The study compares self-reported positive mental health among 651 refugees, 309 economic immigrants, and 448 family class immigrants from 50 source countries. Immigration-related predictors of mental health were examined including sociodemographic characteristics, discrimination, acculturation variables, and experiences of reception. Separate analyses were carried out for women and men. Refugees had lower levels of positive mental health than other migrants. Affiliative feelings towards the source country jeopardized refugee, but not immigrant mental health. A sense of belonging to Canada was a significant predictor of mental health. Perceived discrimination explained refugee mental health disadvantage among men, but not women. Bridging social networks were a mental health asset, particularly for women. The implications of anti-refugee discrimination net of the effects of anti-immigrant and anti-visible minority antipathies are discussed, as well as possible reasons for gender differences in the salience of mental health predictors.

This study aimed to compare the prevalence of physical symptoms among White, Latino and Asian Americans, and examine the association of symptoms and acculturation. Methods: We analyzed data from the National Latino and Asian American Study, a nationally representative survey of 4864 White, Latino and Asian American adults. We compared the age- and gender-adjusted prevalence of 14 physical symptoms among the racial/ethnic groups and estimated the association between indicators of acculturation (English proficiency, nativity, generational status and proportion of lifetime in the United States) and symptoms among Latino and Asian Americans. Results: After adjusting for age and gender, the mean number of symptoms was similar for Whites (1.00) and Latinos (0.95) but significantly lower among Asian Americans (0.60, P < .01 versus Whites). Similar percentages of Whites (15.4%) and Latinos (13.0%) reported three or more symptoms, whereas significantly fewer Asian Americans (7.7%, P < .05 versus Whites) did. In models adjusted for sociodemographic variables and clinical status (psychological distress, medical conditions and disability), acculturation was significantly associated with physical symptoms among both Latino and Asian Americans, such that the most acculturated individuals had the most physical symptoms. Conclusions: The prevalence of physical symptoms differs across racial/ethnic groups, with Asian Americans reporting fewer symptoms than Whites. Consistent with a 'healthy immigrant' effect, increased acculturation was strongly associated with greater symptom burden among both Latino and Asian Americans.

The aims were to determine the prevalence of postpartum depressive symptoms, PPDS, identify associations with ethnicity and with the level of social integration. Method: Population-based, prospective cohort study of 643 pregnant women (58% ethnic minorities) attending primary antenatal care in Oslo. Questionnaires regarding demographics and health issues were collected through interviews. PPDS was defined as a sum score ≥ 10 by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, used as the main outcome in logistic regression analyses, first with ethnicity, second with level of integration as main explanatory factors. Results: The prevalence of PPDS was higher in ethnic minorities 12.7% (95% CI: 9.31–16.09) than in Western Europeans 4.8% (2.26–7.34). Adverse life events, lack of social support and depressive symptoms during the index pregnancy were other significant risk factors. Western European with PPDS were more likely to have had depressive symptoms also during pregnancy than women from ethnic minorities (72.2% versus 33.3%, p = 0.041). When replacing ethnicity with integration, a low level of integration was independently associated with PPDS (2.1 (1.11–3.95)). Limitations: Cases with PPDS were limited. Heterogeneity in the ethnic groups is a concern. Conclusion: Both point prevalence and new onset of PPDS was higher among ethnic minorities than among Western Europeans. Low level of integration was associated with PPDS. Our findings suggest that clinicians should be aware of the increased risk of new cases of PPDS among ethnic minorities compared to Western European women and offer evidence-based care accordingly.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Texas City Stress and Health Study conducted in Texas City, Texas during 2004–2006. Participants: A total of 1435 Mexican-Americans aged 25 years and older. Measures: Binge drinking (≥6 drinks per occasion by men and ≥4 drinks per occasion by women) and scoring positive on the CAGE (a four-item clinical measure of problem drinking) as dependent variables. Key independent variables included a measure of language acculturation, proportion of Hispanics in the participant's neighborhood according to 2000 U.S. Census data, and being foreign-born compared with being U.S.-born. Analysis: Logistic regression analysis was used to predict being a binge drinker and being positive on the CAGE. Results: Foreign-born women were less likely to be binge drinkers than U.S.-born women. Nativity was not significant among men. Moreover women were less likely to be binge drinkers if they lived in heavily Hispanic neighborhoods. No such effect was found among men. Similar results were obtained with the CAGE. Conclusions: We found a powerful influence of nativity (being U.S.-born compared with foreign born) and neighborhood Hispanic concentration on problem drinking among women but not among men. It is likely that cultural norms in heavily Hispanic environments discourage problem drinking among women but not among men.

Acculturation was assessed as a bidimensional process comprising attachment to the heritage culture and adaptation to the local Swiss culture, using the Vancouver Index of Acculturation. AA in migrant women was mainly predicted by psychosocial factors, namely socioeconomic status, marital support, family presence in Geneva and parity, while AD was predicted by one dimension of acculturation, i.e., attachment to the heritage culture.

A theoretical framework consisting of acculturation, consumer ethnocentrism, time, and demographics was assembled; and an exploratory study was undertaken involving 255 samples of Malaysian consumers residing in the UK. The findings suggest that levels of consumer ethnocentrism are inversely related to their length of residence in the host country. Hence, respondents who reside longest exhibit less ethnocentric behavior. Contrary to our prediction, no significant relationship exists between assimilation and consumer ethnocentrism. Of significance, however, highly assimilated individuals are likely to be young male and single persons, with low assimilation most likely found in middle-aged to older married females.

Additionally, we studied the mediating role of affiliation with cannabis-using peers. Method: Data were utilized from i4culture, a Dutch study on immigrant adolescents and young adults aged 15–24 years. Participants belonged to the five largest immigrant populations in the Netherlands, living in or around the four major Dutch cities: Amsterdam, the Hague, Rotterdam, and Utrecht. In total, 771 adolescents and young adults (mean age 19.29, SD = 2.61, 53.8% female) from Surinamese (n = 210, 27.2%), Moroccan (n = 209, 27.1%), Turkish (n = 110, 14.3%), Antillean (n = 109, 14.1%), and Asian (n = 133, 17.3%) backgrounds participated. With questionnaires, past year cannabis use, acculturation strategy, linguistic acculturation, and affiliation with cannabis-using peers were assessed. Results: Using logistic regression analyses, we found no relation between acculturation strategy and past year cannabis use (OR = 1.25, p = 0.38 for separation vs integration and OR = 0.86, p = 0.50 for marginalization vs integration). Linguistic acculturation was positively related to cannabis use (OR = 2.20, p < 0.01). Affiliation with cannabis-using peers partly mediated this relation (OR = 1.09, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Non-Western immigrant youngsters who speak the host culture’s language at home are more likely to use cannabis than youngsters who speak their native language at home. The former group is more likely to affiliate with cannabis-using peers, which partly explains their increased risk of cannabis use.

Although previous studies have extensively examined demographic and residency characteristics, the relative influence of the other factors has not been comprehensively investigated. Multivariate analyses indicated that across the different refugee groups, the model explained 34-44% of the variance in employment status and 12-26% of the variance in estimated earnings. Consistent with previous findings, demographic characteristics, in particular, education, gender, and household composition, had the largest effects on the indicators of economic adaptation.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate structural relations among this set of variables using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) via AMOS 17.0. The results of SEM analyses documented acceptable fit of a model which hypothesized that relations between acculturation and alcohol use variables are mediated partially by acculturative stress, perceived peer alcohol use, and perceived injunctive social norms. While significant path coefficients were documented for paths between (a) acculturation and acculturative stress and (b) acculturative stress and alcohol use, the coefficients had negative signs, contrary to existing studies investigating these relations among immigrant youth. While paths between (a) perceived peer alcohol use or (b) perceived injunctive social norms and participants’ alcohol use were significant, path coefficients between acculturation and either (a) perceived peer alcohol use or (b) perceived injunctive social norms were not statistically significant. In addition, multiple-group comparisons suggested that social support had a significant moderating influence on several significant paths in the structural model. Specifically, international students reporting higher social support reported lower scores for acculturative stress and alcohol use, in contrast to their counterparts who reported lower scores for social support.

It also comments on aspects of psychometric tools and their appropriateness for use in cross-cultural management research. Design/methodology/approach: Black and Stephen’s Cross-Cultural Adjustment Scale was translated into Arabic using the method of back-translation and a pilot item-by-item debriefing. It was then administered to 111 Arabic-speaking employees of a single firm. Findings: The Arabic language version yielded high alpha coefficients and a subsequent factor analysis revealed three primary factors of cross-cultural adjustment, namely, Work Adjustment, Interaction Adjustment and General Adjustment, which corresponded closely to the original English version of the scale, with two minor exceptions. Research limitations/implications: The research is confined to the cultural-linguistic context in which it was executed. Practical implications: The findings suggest that an Arabic version of the three-factor scale is useful for measuring adjustment in Arabic-speaking samples and implies the wider generalizability of the cross-cultural adjustment construct. The development of this scale in an important region for migrant labor is highly relevant to practice. Originality/value: An Arabic version of the most widely used cross-cultural adjustment scale is of value to researchers and practitioners.

Informed by the theory of segmented assimilation, this study addresses two research questions: (1) Is acculturation associated with alcohol use of Korean American adolescents? and (2) What other social, economic, and cultural forces influence their alcohol use? Survey data were collected from 202 adolescents of Korean descent. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that acculturation was not a significant predictor of most measures of alcohol use, while peer influence, scholastic achievement/aspirations, and current smoking were predictive.

"452","Search2021","thesis",2007,"Lee, Jongwon","Role of acculturation on oral contraceptive use among Korean immigrant women.",1,NA,"The current dissertation study was formatted as a manuscript style and consisted of three unified, journal-ready manuscripts. Manuscript I and II correspond to a systematic review of the literature on attitudes toward oral contraceptive (OC) use among women of reproductive age and the relationship of acculturation with contraceptive use patterns among immigrants, respectively. Manuscript III corresponds to the main dissertation study that was conducted to explore the role of acculturation on OC use among Korean immigrant women. It was specifically aimed to explore the effect of acculturation on attitudes, subjective norms, and intention, with regard to OC use in this population. For the most part, manuscript III presents the methodology of this empirical dissertation study, including the design and methods, statistical analysis, and findings. The Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA; Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980), incorporated with the concept of acculturation, provided the theoretical framework for this study. A random sample of 146 Korean immigrant women was selected from the five boroughs (Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island) of the City of New York, based on Korean surname-based telephone lists. Data were collected using a telephone survey interview from September 2006 to February 2007. Participants were asked to respond to demographic and OC use history questionnaires, Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identify Acculturation Scale (SL-ASIA: Suinn, Rickard-Figueroa, Lew, & Vigil, 1987), and Lee's Oral Contraceptive Use Scale (LOCUS) with five subscales. Pearson correlations, multiple regressions, and hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the hypotheses formulated by a modified version of the TRA model. In general, participants reported low to moderate levels of acculturation. Their attitudes toward OC use were slightly positive, whereas normative pressure and intention to use OCs tended to be negative. The results of analysis revealed that acculturation explained some of the variance in attitudes, subjective norms, and intention to use OCs. Women who were moderately acculturated, as opposed to those who were low acculturated, tended to believe that OC use would lead to positive outcomes and evaluated positively the act of using OCs. In turn, these women held a more favorable attitude toward OC use. In addition, the more acculturated women were, the more likely they were to perceive social pressure to and intend to use OCs. Nevertheless, the findings should be carefully interpreted in that only small portions (i.e., 3-6%) of the variances in attitudes, subjective norms, and intention were accounted for by acculturation.

The present study extends research on Black Caribbean immigrants’ acculturative process by assessing how this group’s experience of the racial context (racial public regard, ethnic public regard, and cultural race-related stress) influences its engagement in African American culture (i.e., adoption of values and behavioral involvement). Data were collected from 93 Black participants of Caribbean descent, ranging in age from 13 to 45 and analyzed using a stepwise hierarchical regression. The findings highlighted that when Black Caribbean-descended participants perceived that the public held a favorable view of their racial group they were more likely to engage in African American culture. In contrast, when participants perceived that the public held a favorable view of their ethnic group (e.g., Haitian) they were less likely to engage in African American culture. Furthermore, among participants experiencing low levels of cultural race-related stress, the associations between racial public regard and engagement with African American culture were amplified. However, for participants experiencing high cultural race-related stress, their engagement in African American culture did not change as a function of racial public regard. These findings may suggest that, for Black Caribbean immigrants, the experience of the racial context influences strategies that serve to preserve or bolster their overall social status and psychological well-being in the United States.

Methods: Perinatal data from a project on the influence of migration and acculturation on pregnancy and birth in Berlin was analyzed. An acculturation index (FRAKK) and two proxy measures (German language proficiency, length of stay in Germany) were used. We performed logistic regression models and calculated age-standardized prevalence ratios (SPR). Results: Smoking prevalence was 19.8% among pregnant Turkish women (n = 702) and 17.8% among German women (n = 2,999). The chance of being a smoker was significantly higher among Turkish women with a length of stay of ≥20 years compared to 0–4 years (OR = 3.63, 95% CI = 1.64–8.05); with good/very good language skills compared to none/minor skills; with high levels of acculturation compared to low levels (the latter only among 18–29-year-old women). Compared to German women, Turkish women with a short length of stay, low acculturation scores and none/minor language skills had lower smoking rates. This finding inverts with long length of stay, high acculturation scores and good/very good language skills (≥20 years: SPR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.56–2.94). Conclusions: Smoking among pregnant Turkish women increases with increasing acculturation. Additionally, immigrant women with a low acculturation level are less often smokers and women with a high level are more often smokers than German women. Prevention measures have to prevent women with a low acculturation from starting to smoke and to induce those with a high acculturation to quit. As smoking and acculturation are group phenomena, it is necessary to involve immigrant communities.

'Western' cultural and historical influences have likely contributed to the modus operandi of these disciplines in recent decades, reflected by a shift in focus towards individual-level variables in the absence of situational factors, and internal rather than external validity in research designs. One example is acculturation research, an area that has been extensively critiqued in recent years for methodological shortcomings as well as a lack of attention to context. Community psychology perspectives have begun, remediating this problem, highlighting the relevance of person-environment interactions in understanding adjustment. In line with such thinking, we profile our acculturation research programme with immigrants in Montreal, Canada, which has included both perceived and actual ethnic density as contextual variables. Our results shed light on some of the contrasting findings in both ethnic density and acculturation research literatures by recognizing that the two variables are likely to be closely interwoven. This research has also begun the process of unpacking the mechanisms of ethnic density effects that might act as mental health protective factors in immigrants. Clinical implications are discussed, as well as the mutually dependent nature between psychological and contextual variables. We make the case for greater collaboration between disciplines such as psychology, psychiatric epidemiology, anthropology, neuroscience, and sociology in order to generate more meaningful research.

In the original article, the figure on page 141, the two predictors 'majority group contact' and 'minority group contact' are incorrectly switched.

Using nationally representative survey data (N = 2,027), we distinguish religious identification from religious practice (worship and dietary practices) and assertion (support for the role of religion in politics and society) as different forms of religious expression. Structural equation models confirm that minority group contact supports and, conversely, majority group contact suppresses religious practice and assertion. In line with religion as social identity, this result is partly because Dutch Muslims with more minority contacts identify more strongly with their religion, whereas those with more majority contacts identify less strongly. As found in a social capital approach, social integration also directly influences religious expression, especially within the most cohesive Turkish minority group.

Youth differed in their exposure to stressors and how they responded to them. Cambodian and Laotian youth reported the highest levels of stressors, except for emotional abuse. Only physical abuse was an independent predictor of serious violence for all groups, except Chinese. Perceived social support buffered the effects of some stressors, whereas increased levels of acculturation, intergenerational/intercultural conflict, and individualism placed youth at increased risk for serious violence. The results suggest that the moderating effects of culture and social support need to be considered when examining the association between life stressors and serious violence for Chinese and Southeast Asian youth.

Questionnaires were completed by 251 Southeast Asian workers living in South Korea. Using a self-administered questionnaire, we assessed the diets before and after living in the hometown and in South Korea. Significant changes observed in the Southeast Asian workers were decreased in consumption frequency of fresh fruits, cooked vegetables, rice noodles, green tea and glutinous rice, and increase in consumption of Kimchi, seaweed, milk, coffee and pizza. These changes were attributed to rapid dietary acculturation. The frequencies of eating homemade food were significantly decreased after they came to Korea except for Thais. Thais showed the highest frequencies of eating homemade food daily among others. 28.2% of respondents said their health condition had deteriorated after living in South Korea due to difficulties to adapt Korean food, increased frequencies of eating instant food, and lacking exercises. By providing understanding of the dietary patterns of Southeast Asian workers, these results can be used for preliminary data to develop a program for their Korean food adaptation.

Self-reported life satisfaction has been used to evaluate the immigrants’ integration within their country of residence, as it is commonly employed to estimate the perceived quality of life within a country or a specific social group. Results show that self-reported life satisfaction strongly depends on immigrants’ demographic characteristics and human capital factors, such as age, marital status, current economic situation and perceived financial well-being. ‘Immigration’ variables also play a role in determining life satisfaction, thus proving that conditions at both the origin and destination are important in determining immigrants’ self-reported life satisfaction. In particular, legal status and country of residence play a significant role in defining immigrants’ life satisfaction, thus demonstrating that the rights, resources and restrictions immigrants find within their country of residence determine their subjective experience of integration.

The migrant adolescents included 55 Chinese migrant adolescents who migrated to Australia (Chinese-Australian) and 111 China-born adolescents who migrated to Hong Kong (Chinese-Hong Kong). The nonmigrant adolescents included 157 Anglo-Australian adolescents residing in Australia and 456 Hong Kong-born Chinese adolescents residing in Hong Kong. There were three research questions in this study. First, would there be any differences in the adaptation of Chinese migrant adolescents in different societies of settlement? Second, would migrant adolescents experience more adaptation problems than nonmigrant adolescents? Third, would there be any differences in the adaptation of adolescents in the two societies, Australia and Hong Kong? It was hypothesized that: (1) mainland Chinese migrant adolescents in Hong Kong would experience more adaptation problems than Chinese migrant adolescents in Australia; (2) migrant adolescents would report better adaptation than nonmigrant adolescents; (3) adolescents in Hong Kong would report poorer adaptation than adolescents in Australia. The participants were requested to complete a questionnaire on various adaptation outcome measures including life satisfaction, self-esteem, psychological symptoms, academic satisfaction, and behavior problems. The results indicated that Chinese-Australian adolescents reported better psychological adaptation but Chinese-Hong Kong adolescents reported better sociocultural adaptation. Adolescents resident in Australia reported higher psychological adaptation but lower sociocultural adaptation than those in Hong Kong. Migrant adolescents reported better psychological and sociocultural adaptation than their nonmigrant counterparts. The results were discussed in relation to the social and educational systems of the two societies.

Objectives: Using the data from California Health Interview Survey, we test the hypothesis whether acculturation is associated with recreational computer use among Latino adolescents. Methods: We run linear regressions of the weekly time spent on recreational computer use among Latino adolescents, stratified first by gender and then by age group (12–14 and 15–17 years). Years living in the United States and language at home are used as key variables for acculturation. Results: For all four sub-populations, living in the United States for less than 5 years is significantly associated with fewer hours on recreational computer use, compared with those US-born. Among female adolescents, those who lived in the United States for 10 years or more spent fewer hours on recreational computer use than those US-born. Among adolescents under 15, speaking English only and speaking English plus another language are both significantly associated with more hours on recreational computer use, compared with those who speak a non-English language at home. Conclusion: Educators and health professionals should heed the Latino adolescents’ possible increase in recreational computer use.

The objectives of this paper are to examine the associations between immigrant generational status (IGS), child maltreatment (CM), intimate partner violence (IPV) and acculturation (i.e., the extent to which an individual adopts the values, language and attitudes of a new culture). Methods: The sample was drawn from wave two of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC; n = 34,653), a nationally representative survey of United States (US) residents aged 20 years and older. Logistic regression was used to estimate the associations between IGS, CM history, IPV, and acculturation. Results: Compared to 3rd generation (or later) respondents, 1st generation immigrants were less likely to report a history of sexual (AOR = 0.74, CI0.95 = 0.62, 0.90) and emotional abuse (AOR = 0.69, CI0.95 = 0.55, 0.87), but were more likely to report physical neglect (AOR = 1.30, CI0.95 = 1.11, 1.52). After adjusting for covariates, IGS was not associated with IPV among respondents with or without a CM history. Among those without a CM history, highly acculturated 1st generation immigrants (AOR = 1.07, CI0.95 = 1.01, 1.13) were more likely to report perpetrating IPV, with highly acculturated 3rd generation respondents having lower odds of reporting IPV perpetration (AOR = 0.93, CI0.95 = 0.88–1.00). Conclusion: IGS and acculturation are important factors in CM and IPV. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the influence of IGS, recency of immigration, acculturation and acculturative stress on the experiences and relationship between CM and IPV.

Support was obtained for all hypotheses. In particular, evidence was obtained for the continued presence, in the immigrants, of the culture-transmission motive postulated by the theory: the desire to maintain the culture of origin and transmit it to the next generation. Support was also obtained for the hypothesized anchoring of the culture-transmission motive in more basic motives fulfilled by cultural groups, the relative intra- and intergenerational stability of the culture-transmission motive, and its motivating effects for action tendencies and desires that support cultural transmission under the difficult conditions of migration. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the assumption that people have a culture-transmission motive belongs to the folk psychology of sociocultural groups, and that immigrants regard the fulfillment of this desire as a moral right.

Design/methodology/approach: An empirical study is conducted among a sample of 218 immigrants from several West African countries now living in Canada. ANOVA and paired samples t-tests were used to test the research hypotheses. Findings: The results show that the majority of the surveyed West African immigrants fall into one of two acculturation groups: integrated or separated. Although there are no significant differences between these two groups in terms of their perception that a consumer complaint is more likely to be successful in Canada than in their home countries, there are significant differences in their complaining behaviors in Canada and at home. Research limitations/implications: Marketers should be aware that not all immigrants are the same and that market segmentation based on the degree of immigrants’ acculturation might lead to a sound marketing strategy. Practical implications: Caution should be exercised in generalizing the research results to the entire population of West African immigrants in Canada. Originality/value: Most previous studies of the consumption behavior of immigrants have examined their perceptions and behavior mainly in the context of the host country, while overlooking their perceptions and behavior in their home countries. The present study has addressed this gap in the literature by investigating the perceptions and behavior of West African immigrants to Canada in both contexts.

Substantial research has concluded that Latino women are more likely than non-Latino women to experience trauma-related symptoms following victimization. In addition, examination of different types of cultural adaptation has found results supporting the idea that maintaining ties with one’s culture of origin may be protective against negative mental health outcomes. The present study evaluates the effect of victimization, immigrant status, and both Anglo and Latino orientation on psychological distress in a national sample of Latino women. Results indicate that along with the total count of victimization experiences, Anglo and/or Latino orientation were strong predictors of all forms of psychological distress. Anglo orientation also functioned as a moderator between victimization and psychological distress measures for anger, dissociation, and anxiety. The results suggest a more nuanced and complex interaction between cultural factors, victimization, and psychological distress.

In addition, immigrant status, acculturation, gender role ideology, and religious intensity were examined as predictors of the count of victimization among the victimized subsample. The Sexual Assault Among Latinas (SALAS) Study surveyed 2,000 adult Latino women who lived in high-density Latino neighborhoods in 2008. The present study reports findings for a subsample of women who were victimized in the United States (n = 568). Immigrant women reported significantly less victimization than U.S.-born Latino women in bivariate analyses. Multivariate models showed that Anglo orientation was associated with greater odds of all forms of victimization, whereas both Latino orientation and being an immigrant were associated with lower odds of all forms of victimization. Latino orientation was more protective for immigrant women than for U.S.-born Latino women with regard to sexual victimization. Among the victimized subsample, being an immigrant, Anglo acculturation, and masculine gender role were associated with a higher victimization count, whereas Latino orientation and religious intensity were associated with a lower victimization count. The findings point to the risk associated with being a U.S. minority, the protective value of Latino cultural maintenance, and the need for services to reach out to Anglo acculturated Latino women.

The goal of our study is to examine the impact of perceived overqualification on job satisfaction and career satisfaction among immigrants. Furthermore, we investigated immigrants’ host national identity as a moderator of the impact of perceived overqualification on job satisfaction and career satisfaction. We analysed longitudinal online survey data from 124 Italian and Spanish immigrants who migrated to Germany between 2000 and 2014. Regression analyses show that perceived overqualification is negatively associated with job satisfaction six months later. Furthermore, host national identity moderates the association between perceived overqualification and job satisfaction: low overqualification is beneficial for job satisfaction whereas high overqualification is a threat for job satisfaction, especially for immigrants who identify strongly with the host society. We do not find corresponding direct and moderating effects on career satisfaction.

A national online survey was conducted with 1334 migrants in Australia, examining 11 different sources of social support, including family, friends, relationship partner, acquaintances, work colleagues, health professionals, government agencies, community organisations, religious groups, social groups and online groups. We also examined migrants from different cultural groups. All sources of support were significantly associated with mental health, but somewhat differently for the dimensions of distress and flourishing. Flourishing was linked to higher support from all 11 sources, though not for all cultural groups. High psychological distress was linked to lower support only from family, friends, a partner, acquaintances, work colleagues and social groups, and only for some cultural groups. In particular, for distress, there was no link between migrants from Southern Asia and family support, as well as Confucian Asia groups and friend support. Understanding where migrants from different cultural origins draw their support from could help policymakers and support workers improve health and well-being in migrant populations, especially by focusing on sources of support that are linked to lower distress and greater flourishing, as indicated in this study.

Methods: Data were obtained from an observational study of urban pediatric asthma. Dependent variables were children's diagnosed asthma and total (diagnosed plus possible) asthma. Regression models were controlled for caregivers' level of acculturation, education, marital status, depression, life stress, and social support and children's insurance. Results: Caregivers' level of acculturation was associated with children's diagnosed asthma (P = .025) and total asthma (P = .078) in bivariate analyses. In multivariate models, protective effects of caregivers' level of acculturation were mediated by the other covariates. Independent predictors of increased diagnosed asthma included caregivers' life stress (odds ratio [OR] = 1.12, P = .005) and children's insurance, both public (OR = 4.71, P = .009) and private (OR = 2.87, P = .071). Only caregiver's life stress predicted increased total asthma (OR = 1.21, P = .001). Conclusions: The protective effect of caregivers' level of acculturation on diagnosed and total asthma for Mexican American children was mediated by social factors, especially caregivers' life stress. Among acculturation measures, foreign birth was more predictive of disease status than was language use or years in country. Increased acculturation among immigrant groups does not appear to lead to greater asthma risk.

Based on recent cross-sectional survey data from Germany, we examined the acculturation preferences (cultural maintenance and maintenance of intergroup relations) of members of immigrant groups (immigrants from non-Western countries; Nindividual level = 317) living in different districts in Germany (Ndistrict-level = 179). On the social context level, we used the mean prejudice- and acculturation preferences-scores of the German respondents (N = 3,495) as proxies for the intergroup climate within these districts. Results of multilevel path analysis showed that on the context level, a negative intergroup climate (i.e., a higher amount of prejudice of the German respondents within the districts) was related to a stronger desire for cultural maintenance among the immigrants. The potential implications of a hostile intergroup climate for the acculturation process are discussed.

Women participated regularly in a Korean Church and drew on their Christian faith to ease their adjustment. They retained hopes for the future including good health and a better life for their children. Most women indicated that it was difficult to integrate into Canadian society but they never gave up on their adjustment to a new culture. In this manuscript, the adjustment experience of the immigrant women is discussed in the context of an acculturation framework.

FSI was positively associated with the consumption of common American foods and negatively associated with eating Hispanic and Asian foods. In addition, FSI was associated with generational status among all racial/ethnic groups and duration of U.S. residence among Hispanics. FSI was also negatively associated with the Healthy Eating Index 2010. The FSI enables researchers to compare immigrants’ dietary patterns over generations and across groups.

The process of acculturation and the stress involved in adapting to the host culture and preserving homeland traditions can have a significant impact on the lives of immigrants and their children (Berry, 2003). Studies have shown that acculturation style, that is, the manner in which one acculturates, can affect physical and mental health in immigrant populations (Hans, 2001). The substantial increase in the numbers of Indian Asian immigrants to the U.S. has been described as one of the most significant demographic developments in decades (Durvasula & Mylvaganam, 1994). Despite this growing population, few studies have been conducted specifically on the effects of acculturation and acculturative stress in Indian Asian Americans (Saroop, 2003). As the number of Indian Asians seeking psychological services increases so does the need for research on this population (Saroop, 2003. The current study examined acculturative style and its effect on acculturative stress and individual well being in adult Indian Asians living in the United States. A convenience sample of 53 Asian Indians from a church in the Midwest was recruited for this study. The measures used were the Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identity Scale to assess acculturation strategies, the Acculturation Stress Scale for International Students to assess acculturative stress, and the Satisfaction with Life Scale to assess well-being. The results indicate that 3 acculturation strategy did not have an impact on acculturative stress nor was acculturative stress related to life satisfaction. Limitations of the study included the use of a convenience sample and the small size and homogeneity of the sample. The purpose of the study was to broaden the limited pool of research on this population and in so doing provide empirical support for culturally competent clinical practice and increasing culturally specific mental health policies and resources. Continued research on the impact of acculturation processes on mental health in Indian Asians needs to be conducted with larger more varied samples of Indian Asians.

We find that acculturation remains an important determinant of Latino health; however, this varies based on whether the sample is restricted to immigrants or includes all Latino adults and on the measures of acculturation employed. We find Latino citizens reported better health than non-citizens; however, other acculturation measures, such as language use and time in the U.S. do not have a marked effect. Furthermore, skin color matters only for U.S.-born Latinos. Racialization is therefore important to consider within the context of the Hispanic paradox.

The average level of acculturation was lower among older Korean Americans in New York, compared to those living in Florida. In the hierarchical regression models with the New York sample, acculturation was initially significant in predicting depressive symptoms; however, its impact was gradually attenuated and eventually became nonsignificant with the sequential entry of control variables. On the other hand, in the Florida sample, the impact of acculturation on depressive symptoms remained significant throughout the models.

The way people adapt to a new country (acculturation) is a complex process in which immigrants’ evaluations about the culture of origin and their perceptions of the host country interact. The combination of these two factors produces four types of acculturation: separation, assimilation, integration, and marginalization. Several variables, such as personality, attitudes, and emotional intelligence, have been studied to help explain this process. However, the impact of a culture of honor and its interaction with other variables remains an open question that may help to explain how migrants can better adjust to their host culture. In this study, we examine the influence of the culture of honor (social) and emotional intelligence (individual) on acculturation. In a sample of 129 Moroccan women (mean age = 29, SD = 9.40) immigrants in Spain (mean time in Spain = 6 years, SD = 3.60), we investigated the relations among the variables of interest. Our results show that no significant differences emerged in the scores given for culture of honor (CH) and the acculturation strategies of the Moroccan immigrant women F(3, 99) = .233; p = .87. However women who preferred the integration strategy scored highest on emotional intelligence (EI), whereas the assimilated immigrants showed the lowest scores for EI F(3, 92) = 4.63; p = .005.

An analogous paradox may exist between foreign-born (FB) and US-born (USB) Latinas. Our goal was to assess differences in LBW in USB Latinas, FB Latinas, and non-Latina Whites in Los Angeles County in 2003 using birth records and survey data. Using logistic regression, we estimated associations between LBW and birthplace/ethnicity in a birth cohort and nested survey responder group and between LBW and acculturation in responders to a follow-up survey. USB Latinas and FB Latinas had a higher prevalence of LBW infants compared to Whites (odds ratio [OR] = 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] = (1.17, 1.53) and OR = 1.32, 95% CI = (1.18, 1.49), respectively); when we adjusted for additional maternal risk factors these point estimates were attenuated, and interval estimates were consistent with a modest positive or inverse association. Among Latinas only, LBW was more common for high-acculturated FB and USB Latinas compared to low-acculturated FB Latinas, and there was limited evidence that environmental or behavior risk factors had less impact in low-acculturated Latinas. In summary, adjusting only for demographics, Latinas in our study were more likely to have LBW infants compared to Whites, in contrast to the Latina paradox hypothesis. Furthermore, adjusting for environmental or behavioral factors attenuated the positive association, but there was little evidence that Latinas had a lower prevalence of LBW regardless of the variables included in the models. Finally, among Latinas, there was limited evidence that associations between known risk factors and LBW were modified by acculturation.

Main Predictor: Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans-II scores. Results: Higher acculturation scores were associated with a significantly lower risk for the metabolic syndrome for foreign-born, but not U.S.-born, Mexican Americans. Conclusion: Immigrant health advantages over U.S.-born Mexican Americans are not evident in older adulthood. Higher acculturation was associated with lowered metabolic syndrome risk among older foreign-born Mexican Americans. This suggests that the prevailing acculturative stress hypothesis may not apply to the health of older adults and that any negative relationship between acculturation and health found in younger adults may yield to different developmental health influences in later adulthood.

Guided by hermeneutic phenomenology and conducted by means of surveys and in-depth interviews, it uses a sample of Russian-speaking immigrants in Toronto, Canada, as a case study. The overarching research problem is divided into three research questions (RQ): RQ1: Who are the readers? RQ2: What are the main characteristics of reading behavior and habits of participants after immigration? RQ3: What role does leisure reading play in participants' lives in immigration? Answering RQ1, the study paints demographic and socio-cultural portraits of participants; recreates a variety of contexts shaping their reading; and unfolds their reader histories. In response to RQ2, it traces immediate post-immigration fluctuations in reading behavior; records the most peculiar reading contents; explores participants' self-perceptions as readers; outlines the major areas of post-immigration changes in leisure reading; and presents the analysis of acculturation stress in the area of leisure reading. It is concluded that leisure reading can be a more sensitive indicator of acculturation than more utilitarian measures, because it can open a window to the cultural and psychological intricacies of acculturation. Finally, RQ3 generates a theoretical discussion of the concept of 'the role of reading' and determines the study focus on immigration-specific, emotional and instrumental, roles. Leisure reading is found important in coping with the culture shock; sharing the experience of others and assessing personal immigration paths; re-evaluating the history of the fatherland and gaining a new perspective on the national heritage; stabilizing identity; learning about the new country; improving English-language proficiency; and compensating for the deficiencies of a transitional period. In addition, leisure reading emerges as a powerful force cementing ethnic and transnational reading communities. The study expands the selected acculturation models and theories; introduces clarity to the concepts of the role and appeal of reading; highlights the dual and self-reinforcing function of reading as a measure and a determinant of acculturation. Finally, it presents a systematic examination of the ethnic readership that has escaped the attention of reading researchers in the largest immigrant-receiving countries, Canada and the United States.

Outcome variables included presence of past year alcohol consumption, past year binge drinking, and number of binge drinking days.

Alcohol consumption was found in less than half of the sample for both Asians (43.2%) and Hispanics (39.2%). Binge drinking was found in 3.1% of Asians and 8.4% of Hispanics. Acculturation was significantly related to past year alcohol consumption for Hispanics, past year binge drinking for Asians, and binge drinking days for Asians, such that higher level of acculturation predicted a greater likelihood of alcohol consumption but decreased likelihood of binge drinking and fewer binge drinking days.

Acculturation has been linked to stress-related psychological disorders such as depression. The present study investigates the relationship between three acculturation domains (everyday life behaviors, wishful orientation/nostos, and ethnic identity) and symptoms of depression in a sample of foreign immigrants living in Athens, Greece. The sample consisted of 317 immigrants who visited two non-governmental organization polyclinics. All participants were interviewed using the Immigrant Acculturation Scale (IAS) and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The results showed that 133 (42%) out of the 317 interviewees were in a depressive state (CES-D>15). The main finding was that high CES-D scores were related to low scores in the IAS Everyday Life and Wishful Orientation factors, while no relationship was found between depressive symptomatology and the IAS Identity factor. Short duration of stay in Greece, lack of steady job, and lack of residence permit were also related to high CES-D scores. In conclusion, adaptation to mainstream culture daily behaviors as well as the wish to integrate with individuals from the mainstream culture and settle permanently in the new country could be seen as part of an adaptive mechanism that protects the individual from experiencing depressive symptomatology.

Methods: Existing data from an epidemiological study conducted among Dutch, Turkish and Moroccan inhabitants of Amsterdam were re-examined. Four scales of acculturation strategies were created in combination with the bi-dimensional approach of acculturation by factor analysis. The Lowlands Acculturation Scale and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview were used to assess acculturation and mood and anxiety disorders. Socio-demographic variables, depressive, anxiety and co-morbidity of both disorders and the use of health care services were associated with the four acculturation strategies by means of Chi-Squared and Likelihood tests.

Significant associations were found between the acculturation strategies and age (p < .01), education (p < .01), daily occupation (p < .01) and having a long-term relationship (p = .03). A significant association was found between acculturation strategies and depressive disorders (p = .049): integration was associated with a lower risk of depression, separation with a higher risk. Using the axis separately, participation in Dutch society showed a significant relationship with a decreased risk of depressive, anxiety and co-morbidity of both disorders (OR = .15; 95% CI: .024 - .98). Non-participation showed no significant association. No association was found between the acculturation strategies and uptake of GP care. Conclusions: Turkish migrants who integrate may have a lower risk of developing a depressive disorder. Participation in Dutch culture is associated with a decreased risk of depressive, anxiety and co-morbidity of both disorders. Further research should focus on the assessment of acculturation in the detection of depression.

C.","The role of acculturation attitudes and social support in anxiety and depression of Indian immigrants in Greece.",1,NA,"In the present study, we examined factors that may impact immigrants’ anxiety and depressive symptoms, focusing on the role of acculturation attitudes and social support. The participants of the present study were first generation Indian immigrants residing in Crete, Greece (N = 114). Our first hypothesis was that Indian immigrants will choose two acculturation attitudes, namely integration and separation, as these may enable them maintain certain aspects of their culture of origin given their distinct differences from Greeks in religion, cultural values, and physical appearance. It was also hypothesized that integration and separation will be positively related to social support. Social support was also expected to mediate the negative relationship of separation and integration to anxiety and depression. Furthermore, social support was expected to act protectively for Indian immigrants who chose integration and separation, minimizing the levels of anxiety and depression (i.e., a moderation effect). Using specific measures for anxiety, depression, social support, and acculturation attitudes, the results showed that Indian immigrants report a greater preference for integration and separation. Separation was the only acculturation attitude positively related to social support and negatively to depression through social support from friends and family. Moreover, higher levels of social support seemed to protected immigrants who choose integration from depression and medium and high levels of social support protected immigrants who choose assimilation from anxiety. These findings indicate that both integration and separation are preferred by Indian immigrants in Greece. Moreover, it seems that in the case of Indian immigrants in Greece, separation could be related to more immigrants’ social support than other acculturation attitudes, ending in turn to less depression symptoms. These findings demonstrate that different acculturation attitudes (i.e. assimilation, integration, separation) may have different effects on disbetinct psychological indices. Moreover, immigrants’ social support is a protecting factor in the relationship between acculturation attitudes to anxiety and depression. The present study suggests that the increase of the immigrants’ social networks could prove helpful for their adaptation to the Greek society.

Berry's acculturation theories suggest that immigrants' mental health can be negatively affected by their experience of biological and psychosocial difficulties related to acculturation. Data from a nationally representative study, the New Immigrant Survey, was utilized to examine how acculturation stress factors can predict depressive symptoms in a sub-Saharan African sample of 669 adults. The collectivistic nature of African culture suggests that family support is a critical element in the acculturation process, but family support was not found to be a predictor of help-seeking behavior. Results indicated that when birth country was controlled for, proficient English language skills and higher education level were predictive of increased help-seeking behavior. Additionally, English language proficiency was negatively associated with depressive symptoms. Findings suggest that proficiency in host country's language serves as a protective factor against depressive symptoms, and English proficiency and higher educational attainment predict greater use of support systems in African immigrants.

While the theory has been interpreted in many different ways, we emphasize its implications for the important role of social context: both processes and consequences of assimilation should depend on the local social context in which immigrants are embedded. We derive empirically falsifiable hypotheses about the interaction effects between social context and assimilation on immigrant children’s well-being. We then test the hypotheses using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Our empirical analyses yield two main findings. First, for immigrant adolescents living in non-poverty neighborhoods, we find assimilation to be positively associated with educational achievement and psychological well-being but also positively associated with at-risk behavior. Second, there is little empirical evidence supporting our hypotheses derived from segmented assimilation theory. We interpret these results to mean that future research would be more fruitful focusing on differential processes of assimilation rather than differential consequences of assimilation.

The purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate factors that influence depression among older Korean immigrants in Toronto. A total of 148 participants, ages 60 years or older (mean age = 74.01, SD = 8.24), completed face-to-face interviews in Korean language. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted by adding variables in three steps: 1) demographic variables; 2) acculturation variables (years of immigration and English proficiency); and 3) social determinants (social integration variables, physical health, and financial satisfaction). Results showed that acculturation factors were not associated with depression. Instead, social determinants variables, including lower physical health status and lower financial status, living alone, and lower level of social activity, predicted higher level of depressive symptoms, along with lower education. The final regression model explained about 37% of variance of depression in the sample. These results suggest that social determinants, not acculturation, are important factors explaining the levels of depression in Korean immigrant elders living in a metropolitan city in Canada.

Furthermore, exposure to traumas is highly prevalent in refugees and strongly associated with mental health outcomes, however, rarely included in investigations of acculturative process of refugees. Method: Using structural equation modelling, this study tested an integrated model of the relationship between traumatic exposure, acculturative stress, host and ethnic cultural orientations and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety symptoms among 138 Bosnian refugees resettled in Australia and Austria. Results: The model showed an overall good fit and noteworthy amount of variance indicating that traumatic exposure is the strongest direct and indirect predictor of PTSD, depression and anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, acculturative stress was identified as a significant risk factor influencing host cultural orientation, mediating the effect of traumatic exposure on all mental health outcomes. Conclusion: Acculturative stress and cultural and social stressors that are related to acculturation need to be addressed alongside provision of effective psychotherapy, especially since they are significant impediments to host cultural orientation and constructive engagement with mental health services in refugees.

To assess emotional fit, earlier studies compared minorities’ emotional experience with that of separate samples of 'distant' majority members in their country of residence.

Drawing on large random samples of immigrant minority and majority youth in Belgian high schools (N = 2,543), our study aimed (i) to test majority culture exposure and contact as predictors of emotional fit and (ii) to distinguish emotional fit with distal and proximal variants of majority culture.

A sample of 131 healthy young adults aged between 18 and 24 years old, with a Turkish or Moroccan background was recruited using snowball sampling. Data on acculturation, internalizing and externalizing problems, beliefs about psychological problems, attributions of psychological problems and barriers to care were collected and analyzed using Latent Class Analysis and multinomial logistic regression. Three acculturation classes were identified in moderately to highly educated, healthy Turkish or Moroccan young adults: integration, separation and diffusion. None of the participants in the sample were marginalized or assimilated. Young adults reporting diffuse acculturation reported more internalizing and externalizing problems than those who were integrated or separated. Separated young adults reported experiencing more practical barriers to care than integrated young adults. Further research with a larger sample, including young adult migrants using mental health services, is required to improve our understanding of acculturation, psychological problems and barriers to care in this population.

We investigated factors associated with ethnic and nativity-related differences in the prevalence of low cardiovascular risk (optimal levels of all major cardiovascular risk factors). Methods: We used logistic regression to estimate differences in likelihood of being low risk (not currently smoking; no diabetes; untreated total cholesterol <200 mg/dL; untreated blood pressure <120/<80; and body mass index <25 kg/m²) among 8693 foreign- and U.S.-born Mexican-American and non-Hispanic White 2003–2008 U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey participants before and after adjustment for socioeconomic, lifestyle, and acculturation-related factors. Results: Foreign-born Mexican-Americans were more likely to be low risk than non-Hispanic Whites after adjustment for all covariates (Odds Ratio [OR]: 1.53; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.00, 2.34). In contrast, U.S.-born Mexican-Americans were less likely to be low risk compared to Whites (OR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.84). Differences between foreign-born and U.S.-born Mexican-Americans were largely attenuated after adjustment for acculturation indicators. Conclusions: Our findings support the healthy migrant hypothesis and suggest that acculturation-related factors may be important drivers of ethnic and nativity-related differences in low cardiovascular risk.

This has been particularly difficult to assess among South Asians living in the U.S., due to a lack of disaggregated data on this ethnic group. In a web-based survey administered to a convenience sample of South Asian women living in the U.S. (n = 535), information was gathered on experience/exposure to childhood violence; adult intimate partner violence; and adverse health outcomes, including ever suicide ideation/attempt, experiences of quality of life and body esteem in adulthood. Further, an individual’s acculturation levels were measured specifically looking at cultural identity which was guided by Berry’s biculturalism model. This study found that acculturation status is a key factor with respect to childhood verbal, physical, and sexual abuse, as well as body esteem and an individual’s well-being. These results suggest that acculturation plays a key role for childhood violence, as well as key adult health indicators. The findings in this study, suggest that more research is warranted to better understand the complex relationships between acculturation status and health.

Drawing on interviews and questionnaires, this researcher explored (a) how participants described their traditional and American cultural traditions, beliefs, and values, (b) their infant-feeding practices, and (c) how their infant-feeding practices are shaped by adaptations to traditional and American cultures. In this sample, those women who had recently immigrated to the United States were more likely to exclusively use formula. Interviews suggest that American norms of breastfeeding in public, hectic lifestyles in a new country, and lack of cultural knowledge about pumping and storing breast milk influenced 1st- and 1.5-generation participants to exclusively use formula. For 2nd-generation participants, the awkwardness of breastfeeding in public was also cited as an important influence on their decision to use formula. However, quite different from 1st- and 1.5-generation women, 2nd-generation women were more educated and more likely to be employed in less segregated and professional occupations, which exposed them to mothers of different backgrounds who were breastfeeding. This exposure to breastfeeding mothers appeared to influence breastfeeding initiation among 2nd-generation Hmong. This study also found that negative social support from participants’ mothers and mothers-in-law, and positive social support from sisters and sisters-in-law had a strong impact on their infant-feeding decisions. Unlike previous research among Hispanic immigrants, this study revealed that 2nd-generation Hmong immigrants were slightly more likely to include some form of breastfeeding in their infant-feeding method. This study also revealed the importance of social support and the role of the ethnic community in infant-feeding choices. More research is needed, however, to further clarify the relationship between acculturation and social support on breastfeeding initiation and duration among various immigrant populations.

Recent statistics indicate that Manitoba attracted over 13,000 immigrants in 2009, many coming from Korea. The purpose of this research is to understand and measure the integration experiences of Korean immigrants in Manitoba in terms of their social, political, education and employment domains. The primary theory used in this research is social capital. Theories of acculturation, ethnic economy, power and stratification are also used to situate my research. Data was collected using mixed methods comprising a survey of 260 Korean Canadians living in Winnipeg and qualitative interviews with 12 respondents. The analysis shows, among other things, high levels of racism felt by Korean immigrants in Winnipeg. While this perception and daily encounter of discrimination in the community would impede Korean immigrants’ integration into Canada, there also is a strong will to succeed in the community through accessing existing social capital and a willingness to invest in social capital. The contributions made in the development and operationalization of social capital in terms of willingness to invest and social capital mindset are documented. Several program ideas are offered for policy-makers and future research areas have been identified. The development of a political engagement index provides justification for observations made by the social capital theory and immigrant integration literature.

The study took into account perceived cultural distance variables as well as socio-demographic controls traditionally related to adaptation outcomes among migrants. According to the results, familiarity with the host country (i.e., the number of Finnish friends/relatives in Finland), the openness to change value and perceived value congruence significantly predicted potential migrants’ ASCA. When using four sub-scales (interpersonal relations, cognitive understanding, impersonal perils and bureaucracy) of the ASCA-scale, a more complex picture emerged.

Acculturation options varied across the four samples, with Italians switching more from one culture to another, and Spanish adolescents being more full‐high or full‐low integrated.

Overall, the two studies show that discrepancies between acculturation preferences and actual contact have negative implications for the psychological adaptation of acculturating individuals.

A population-based study in California.",1,NA,"Background: The purpose of this study was to compare rates of screening mammography among immigrant women in five Asian-American ethnic groups in California, and ascertain the extent to which differences in mammography rates among these groups are attributable to differences in known correlates of cancer screening. Methods: Using 2009 data from the California Health Interview Survey, we compared the rates of mammography among Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese immigrants 40 years and older. To assess the impact of Asian ethnicity on participation in screening, we performed multiple logistic regression analysis with models that progressively adjusted for acculturation, sociodemographic characteristics, access to health care, and breast cancer risk factors, and examined the predicted probabilities of screening after adjusting for these factors. Findings: Participation in screening mammography differed according to ethnicity, with Filipina and Vietnamese Americans having the highest rates and Korean Americans having the lowest rates of lifetime and recent (past 2 years) screening. These differences decreased substantially after adjusting for acculturation, sociodemographic factors, and risk factors of breast cancer, but differences remained, most notably for Korean Americans, who continued to have the lowest predicted probability of screening even after adjustment for these factors. Conclusions: This analysis draws attention to low mammography screening rates among Asian-American immigrants, especially recent immigrants who lack health insurance. Given that their breast cancer incidence is rising with length of stay in the United States, it is important to increase regular mammography screening in these groups.

"524","Search2021","thesis",2018,"Buckingham, Sara L.","When real diverges from ideal: How person-environment fit impacts Latina/o immigrants' acculturation and psychosocial wellbeing across four states.",1,NA,"Research indicates that immigrant wellbeing depends upon interactions between immigrants' characteristics and goals, and receiving communities' openness and acceptance (e.g., Phinney, Horenezyk, Liebkind, & Vedder, 2001). Still, most of the immigrant acculturation and wellbeing literature remains acontextual, thus limiting understanding of why some immigrants thrive while others struggle. To address these gaps, this study applied the Relative Acculturation Extended Model (RAEM; Navas et al., 2005) to characterize Latina/o immigrants' ideal and real acculturation across life domains in distinct regions of the United States. It then answered two questions unexplained by the model: (1) Why would ideal acculturation differ from real acculturation? and (2) What impact does the divergence of real acculturation from ideal acculturation have on wellbeing? To address these questions, the current study adopted a concurrent explanatory mixed-method approach (Creswell & Plano-Clark, 2007). Four hundred eighty Latina/o immigrants were recruited from two state pairs (i.e., Arizona and New Mexico, Maryland and Virginia), chosen for their demographic characteristics and immigration-related public policies, to participate in survey measures. A subset of participants (n = 73) participated in 12 focus groups. Quantitative data were primarily analyzed through ANOVA and path analyses and qualitative data were analyzed through constructivist grounded theory, informed by the constructs under study. Results indicated that participants wished to and did adopt more of their receiving communities' cultures in peripheral (e.g., work, economics, political systems, social welfare) and intermediate (e.g., social relationships, friendships) life domains than they did in central (e.g., family relationships, religious customs, ways of thinking, principles, values) life domains. Conversely, they wished to and did maintain their cultures in central life domains more than they did in other life domains. They had more difficulties changing and maintaining cultural customs in preferred ways in peripheral domains. Participants in Arizona, and to some degree, Virginia, were less able to make desired cultural changes than participants in Maryland and New Mexico. The proposed socio-ecological model of acculturation fit the data well, explaining why real acculturation may differ from ideal acculturation. A set of personal and contextual factors (i.e., ideal cultural change; quality of contact with, and acculturative preferences and prejudicial attitudes of the receiving community; perceived threat, and immigration-related public policies) predicted Latina/o immigrants' cultural changes, directly and/or indirectly through their sense of community with the receiving community and/or intergroup anxiety. A similar set of factors influenced Latina/o immigrants' cultural maintenance, directly and/or indirectly through their sense of community with the local Latina/o immigrant community. Qualitative data also indicated that personal characteristics, community resources, and information impacted the ways in which Latina/o immigrants changed and maintained their cultures. Finally, the better Latina/o immigrants were able to change and maintain their cultures in desired ways, the better their self-reported wellbeing, in part due to less acculturative stress with the receiving community. In sum, this study provides insight into reasons for the diverse array of Latina/o immigrant acculturation and wellbeing in the United States in light of their disparate contexts, preferences, and experiences.

Focus is given to demographic variables (age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, and education), health-related variables (chronic medical condition and self-rated health), immigration-related variables (time in the U.S. and acculturation), and family-related variables (family network and family solidarity). Cross-sectional study. Data were drawn from 2551 participants in the 2015 Asian American Quality of Life Survey (aged 18–98). Participants were asked to indicate whether they would be willing to use a nursing home in the future. An affirmative response indicated a personal willingness to use a nursing home. Approximately 38% of the sample demonstrated willingness to use a nursing home. Higher odds for willingness were observed among those with advanced age, female gender, Korean ethnicity (compared with Chinese), better education, presence of a chronic medical condition, longer years of residence in the U.S., and lower levels of family solidarity. Reflecting the current trend of an increase in racial/ethnic minorities in nursing homes, a substantial proportion of the present sample of Asian Americans demonstrated willingness to use a nursing home. Findings on the factors associated with willingness provide implications for policies and services to respond to the long-term care needs of this emerging population.

The results indicated that participants were more acculturated to their heritage culture compared to the host culture. The majority of Sri Lankan and Indian skilled migrants were moderately acculturated into Australian society, and were most acculturated in the language dimension, followed by the behavior and identity dimensions respectively. Years since migration predicted overall host acculturation but not overall heritage acculturation. While overall heritage acculturation predicted personal wellbeing, overall host acculturation was a stronger predictor. Testing of a mediation model demonstrated that overall host acculturation fully mediated the relationship between years since migration and wellbeing. Further analysis showed that only host identity and language acculturation, and not host behavior acculturation, mediated the relationship between years since migration and wellbeing. Implications of these findings are discussed.
