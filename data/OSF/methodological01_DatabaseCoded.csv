8.        Marginalization: I often feel helpless because I can't seem to express my feelings and thoughts into words.

Society
9.        Assimilation: Encouraging Koreans to stick together only hinders our acceptance into Canadian society.
10.        Separation: Because we live in the Canada, we are always pressured to conform to Canadian lifestyle. Thus, we must emphasize our distinct Korean identity and restrict our association with Canadian society.
11.        Integration: While living in the Canada I would like to retain Korean cultural heritage and lifestyle, and participate fully in various aspects of Canadian society.
12.        Marginalization: Politicians use national pride to exploit and to deceive the public.

Child-rearing
13.        Assimilation: If I were a parent, I would adopt the Canadian way of child rearing by encouraging independence and individuality, and discourage the Korean way of child rearing.
14.        Separation: If a parent adopts the Canadian way of child rearing, children will become spoiled and disobedient. I would adopt the Korean way by teaching them the virtues of obedience and respect.
15.        Integration: I would adopt the Canadian way of child rearing by encouraging independence and individuality while also teaching them the Korean virtues of obedience and respect.
16.        Marginalization: Present society is changing so fast that it's hard to teach children how to live and be happy.

Value
17.        Assimilation: Teaching children Korean values and customs only creates a barrier with other Canadians. I would rather teach them Canadian values so that they could be like other Canadians.
18.        Separation: I would teach children mainly Korean values and customs so that they will not become Canadianized, but remain as Koreans.
19.        Integration: I would encourage children to be educated and to participate fully in various aspects of Canadian society, while teaching them the Korean values and customs.
20.        Marginalization: As a parent, it's best to keep the children away from learning all the violence and corruption that the present society has to offer.

Furniture
21.        Assimilation: When I have to furnish a room, I would not buy any Korean furniture because they look so out-of-place, and also because there are so many beautiful Canadian furniture.
22.        Separation: When it comes to furnishing a room, if possible I would want to fill the room with beautiful Korean furniture, Canadian furniture is not attractive.
23.        Integration: I feel that a good coordination of Korean and Canadian furniture can make a room look very attractive.
24.        Marginalization: I can't worry about something as trivial as furniture when I have so many problems.

History course
25.        Assimilation: For students who were raised in the Canada, I would encourage them to take a course in Canadian history, but not in Korean history since it has no utility or value in the Canada.
26.        Separation: For students who were raised in the Canada, I would encourage them to take a course in Korean history, but not in Canadian history since there isn't much worth learning.
27.        Integration: For students who were raised in the Canada, I would encourage them to take both Korean and Canadian history because it's important for them to know the history of both countries.
28.        Marginalization: Taking a course in history is a waste of time since it does not help you to learn anything practical or to get a job.

Success
29.        Assimilation: To be a successful Canadian, we must give up our traditional Korean lifestyle.
30.        Separation: Realistically speaking, Koreans must stick together and help each other to be successful, rather than conforming to Canadian society.
31.        Integration: To be successful we must participate fully in various aspects of Canadian society, and maintain our Korean culture and heritage.
32.        Marginalization: Success depends on being in the right place at the right time.

Television station
33.        Assimilation: It is not necessary to have a Korean TV station. We should learn to adjust to Canada by learning to appreciate what Canadian society has to offer.
34.        Separation: We should focus our attention in developing better Korean TV station so that we can reduce our need to watch Canadian TV stations.
35.        Integration: It was an important step for Koreans to have our own TV station, because we can now watch both Canadian and Korean TV programs.
36.        Marginalization: Present day television program reflects the society's sickness; all you see is sex and violence.

Newspaper
37.        Assimilation: Reading Canadian newspapers can provide all the news necessary, and it makes reading a Korean newspaper unnecessary.
38.        Separation: Reading a Korean newspaper can provide both news of Korea and of the world and it makes reading a Canadian newspaper unnecessary.
39.        Integration: Since it's important to know what's happening in Korea and the Canada, both Korean and Canadian newspapers should be read.
40.        Marginalization: Newspapers only distort reality and they shouldn't be trusted.

Korea town
41.        Assimilation: It is ridiculous to set up a Korean town in Canada. We should learn to live like Canadians.
42.        Separation: Korean town should be developed to reduce our association with Canadian society.
43.        Integration: Koreans can benefit by having a Korean town, and it can help our adaptation in the Canada.
44.        Marginalization: Cities are becoming more violent; we should live in a place away from all the violence and confusion.

Marriage
45.        Assimilation: If I had a choice, I would marry a true Canadian who thinks like me and who enjoys the same things.
46.        Separation: If I had a choice, I would marry someone who was brought up in Korea who knows the Korean values and customs.
47.        Integration: If I had a choice, I would marry a Korean who has a similar experience of having lived in the Canada like me.
48.        Marginalization: There's no such thing as ideal spouse; marriage only creates problems.

Naming
49.        Assimilation: If I had to name a child, I would choose only an English name because having a Korean name would only emphasize his/her difference with other Canadians.
50.        Separation: If I had to name a child, I would give only a Korean name because it is important that the child maintains his/her Korean identity.
51.        Integration: If I had to name a child, I would give him/her both a Korean name and an English name.
52.        Marginalization: I don't like my name because it creates too much problems for me.

Interest
53.        Separation: Canadian society will not look after the interests of Koreans in the Canada; Koreans must stick together and help each other.
54.        Assimilation: We're living in the Canada and that means giving up our traditional way of life and adopting a Canadian lifestyle; thinking and acting like Canadians.
55.        Integration: Koreans should join together and form organizations to represent Korean interests in the Canada, and also actively participate in Canadian organizations.
56.        Marginalization: It's hard to work with other people since most people are interested only in their selfish gain.

","19","4","n/a","see note","""Respondents were asked how well they speak English (Korean) compared with most Americans (Koreans in Korea) with response categories of very much worse, somewhat worse, only a little worse, and as well as most Americans (Koreans in Korea). Mass media consumptionwas assessed by asking howmuch time they usually spend a day reading American (Korean) newspaper(s) or magazine(s), watching American (Korean) TV/video programs or listening to American (Korean) radio programs. Response categories for mass media consumption were none, less than 30 minutes, 30 minutes to 1 hour, 1 to 2 hours, and more than 2 hours. American and Korean food consumption was measured with a food frequency questionnaire. Frequency of American and Korean food consumption per week was calculated. More detailed information on the food consumption measures can be found elsewhere (Lee, Sobal, & Frongillo, 1999a, 1999b, 2000) [...] The structural dimension of the relation to Korean ethnic society was assessed by social partici- pation and social networks in Korean American society. Social participation was measured with two activities (religious and recreational), based on Gordon’s (1964, 1978) definition that it should be on the primary relationship level. Respondents were asked how often they participate in American (Korean) religious and recreational groups or activities. Respon- dents were asked to answer if they participate in the activities rarely or never,a few times a year,a few times a month, about once a week,or more than once a week. Social network size was measured as the number of close friends known well enough to visit each other’s home. Response categories for social network were none, 1-2, 3-5, 6-9, 10-19, 20-49, and 50 or more. These variables have been used in other acculturation studies with Korean Americans (J. K. Kim, 1980; K. C. Kim & Hurh, 1993; Hurh & Kim, 1984b).The marital dimension was measured by whether respondents had any current and ancestral exogamy. The identification dimension was assessed by asking how American (Korean) they think they are: not at all, a little, somewhat, or very much.[...] This study measured a perceived receptional dimension (perceived discrimination in the United States) by asking how comfortable Korean Americans feel with the dominant American society. Comfort with their own ethnic society was also asked to measure the receptional dimension of retention to ethnic society (perceived discrimination in Korean ethnic society). Response categories for this dimension were not at all, a little, somewhat, and very much. The civic dimension of the relation to American society was measured by how interested
they were in learning and understanding the ways most Americans behave and think. Response categories that were provided included (a) not at all, there’s no need to learn because Ican live in Korean ways, (b) a little, but I don’t want to make a conscious effort, (c) somewhat, I want to learn ifchances are given, (d) very much, I would like to try the best I can, and (e) no need, I know how most Americans behave and think. The civic dimension of the relation to Korean ethnic society was measured by their opinion about the statement “Koreans should always be Korean: They cannot and should not assimilate.” Respondents were asked to choose from (a) strongly disagree, (b) somewhat disagree, (c) neither disagree nor agree, (d) somewhat agree, and (e) strongly agree.""""

Criteria:

""Under what circumstances would you consider yourself successful? Name three successful persons and point out their successful features? What do you do to increase your popularity? With whom do you care to be popular?""

Success means to be able to enjoy epicurean and exhibition- istic pleasures such as love, food, or arts. Success is measured in terms of exhibition of power, beauty, and charm regardless of the moral implications.
4. Success implies the obligation to conform with tradition, religion, family, and an- cestors. The cultural striving therefore is: to observe rigidly certain codes and rules for the welfare and reputation of past and future generations of the family. Acceptance of destiny or fate results in passivity and progressive inability to handle reality.

During this time, I was resolved to resettle in another country outside the Soviet Union.
2. During this time my material standard of living (apartment, house, car, household appliances etc.,) was at least as good or even better than I would have had in Czechoslovakia.
3. During this time, my financial resources were generally less (in terms of buying power rather than bank rate) than I would have had in Czechoslovakia.
4. During this time I would have welcomed many of the material advantages which would have been available to me in Czechoslovakia (e.g. financial support by relatives or acquaintances who remain there and would have been glad to assist me, or the free medical care, various social benefits, etc,)
5. During this time, I had more benefit from the security, both of the person and the property, afforded by the Swiss state than I would have had from Czechoslovakia.
6. During this time I felt inwardly closer to and more familiar with the Czechoslovakian settings (landscape and people) than with the Swiss area.
7. During this time I felt better amongst the local people (i.e. both Swiss citizens and resident foreigners) than I would have felt in Czechoslovakia.
8. During this time I felt I understood the local people better than I would the people in Czechoslovakia.
9. During this time I felt that my ways of dealing with people better fitted the Czechoslovakian than the Swiss standard.
10. During this time, I would have preferred (had I the choice) Czechoslovakian rather than Swiss foods and beverages.
11. During this time I was more interested in social events and changes in Switzerland than in those in Czechoslovakia.
12. During this time I felt better understood and recognized as a person by the local people than I would from people in Czechoslovakia.
13. During this time I felt that the people in Switzerland met my various requests more willingly than I would expect from Czechoslovakian people.
14. During this time I felt that my incomplete skills in the local language (i.e. writing, reading or speaking in German or speaking in dialect) placed me in a position of disadvantage in employment settings or in the social life in my free time as compared with the Swiss nationals.
15. During this time I felt I could more easily, with lesser effort, and with greater inner satisfaction cope with the lack of freedom and various aspects of life in Czechoslovakia than I did with the problems associated with adjusting to life in Switzerland. 
16. I am now quite accustomed to the Swiss landscape.
17. I have adopted all the local ways the Swiss use to deal with people and the nuances of behavior they expect from each other. 
18. I am now quite used to the local food
19. I often miss my friends and relatives in Czechoslovakia to whom I could turned when in difficulties
20. I am quite used to the Swiss style of urban life.
21. The local style of amusement or entertainment satisfies me greatly.
22. My personal experience indicates that it is too difficult for a foreigner to adopt the behaviors of Swiss born persons.
23. I am now quite used to the Swiss manner of conversation (intonation, gesticulation, and hand signs).
24. I feel that the Swiss manner of entertainment would never fully satisfy me.
25. My incomplete knowledge of German (speaking and grammar) causes me worries.

Temporal Comparison (SCT):
1. Once I used to make a lot of mistakes while speaking Hebrew. Today my Hebrew is much better. [6, Language]
2. Once I did not have a single Zabar friend, only Ethiopians. Today, I feel more relaxed with Zabarim. [13, Relationships]
3. Once I was unable to understand the behavior of the Zabarim. Today, I feel I am able to understand how people behave here in Israel. [24, Behavior]

Individuation (SIT):
4. I choose friends as it suits me, regardless of their origin, because I feel like neither a Zabar nor an Ethiopian. [1, Relationships]
5. I behave as I feel like; it does not matter whether I am a Zabar or an Ethiopian. [14, Behavior]
6. What does it matter which language I use? I would like others to respond to what I say and not to whether I am an Ethiopian or a Zabar. [25, Language]

Superordinate Re-categorization (SIT & SCT):
7. Since all of us live together here in the land of Israel, we Ethiopians and Zabarim should behave respectfully towards each other. [23, Relationships]
8. Israeli society should be united. Therefore, it does not matter whether I am an Ethiopian or a Zabar. [28, Relationships]

Conglomeration (BAT):
9. I speak Hebrew as well as any Zabar, but I find it important to speak Russian with my family and friends, and not forget it. [5, Language]
10. We can participate fully in many areas of Israeli society, and still maintain our own lifestyle and our own kinds of behavior. [20, Behavior]
11. My relationships with Ethiopian friends are very important to me, and my relationships with Zabarim are very important as well. [40, Relationships]

Comparison with Alternative Out-group (SIT & SCT):
12. I think Ethiopians behave more like Israelis than Russians do. [12, Behavior]

Facet 2: Rivalry Identity
Separation (BAT):
13. I would like to speak my own original language, because it makes me different from the Zabarim and shows that I am from Ethiopia. [3, Language]
14. Only an Ethiopian friend can understand me and be loyal to me. Therefore, all my friends are Ethiopians rather than Zabarim. [33, Relationships]

Comparison with Alternative Out-group (SIT & SCT):
15. I like to use the slang and expressions of blacks in the United States rather than those of the Zabarim. [11, Language]
16. I spend my free time only where they play black music, because I feel closer to blacks in America or Jamaica than to Zabarim. [27, Behavior]
17. I think Ethiopian immigrants speak Hebrew better than the Russians. [31, Language]
18. We Ethiopian youth like to live with guys like us, who share the color of our skin, such as blacks in America and Jamaica, rather than Zabarim. [37, Relationships]

Reevaluation of Comparison Dimensions (SIT):
19. I feel that in Israel everybody takes care of his/her own business instead of behaving according to the saying ‘Israelis should take care of each other’. [7, Behavior]
20. In time, the Zabar boys will understand that the color of our skin is beautiful and will be proud to have an Ethiopian girlfriend. [22, Relationships]
21. I would rather use the language of my former country, because it is simpler and has a lot more proverbs and sayings. [30, Language]
22. In my opinion, the free and bold behavior of the Zabarim encourages violence and delinquency. [46, Behavior] 

Social Competition (SIT):
23. I think Ethiopians should fight for acceptance of their special lifestyle and customs. [8, Behavior]
24. We Ethiopians should fight to get more Amharic programs on television. [34, Language]
25. We Ethiopians are much better friends and much more loyal to each other than the Zabarim. [18, Relationships]

Facet 3: Secluded Identity
Separation (BAT):
26. We are always expected to change our behavior and be more like the Zabarim, but we should maintain our separation and not be like them. [10, Behavior]
27. I think Ethiopians should make friends with other Ethiopians rather than Zabarim. That way they will be special and not a part of the rest. [16, Relationships]
28. I prefer to talk the language of my former country, because I find it difficult to express myself in Hebrew. [17, Language]

Segregation (BAT):
29. I am sure the Zabarim will always think that our skin color is not attractive. [29, Relationships]
30 .The Zabarim do not associate with anybody who has an Ethiopian accent or who does not speak fairly good Hebrew. [32, Language]
31. I think that we Ethiopians will be always rejected, even if we behave just like the Zabarim. [35, Behavior]
32. All my friends are Ethiopians, because the Zabarim do not want to be my friends. [44, Relationships]
33. Even now, after a few years that I am here, they laugh at the way I speak Hebrew. [45, Language]

Comparison with Alternative Out-group (SIT & SCT):
34. As I see it, the Russians behave more like Israelis than the Ethiopians. [9, Behavior]
35. I am sure that a Zabar would rather have an Ethiopian friend than a Russian friend. [43, Relationships]

Facet 4: Identity Loss
Assimilation (SIT & BAT):
36. We live within the Israeli society, meaning that we need to give up the lifestyle and the special behaviors that we brought with us from Ethiopia and adopt, instead, the Israeli lifestyle and Zabar-like behaviors. [4, Behavior]
37. If we Ethiopians want to be a part of society rather than strange outsiders, we should have Zabarim as friends, rather than Ethiopians. [39, Relationships]
38. If we wish to become part of Israeli society, we should not speak Amharic and should speak only Hebrew instead. [42, Language]
39. I think Ethiopians should not fight for acceptance of their special lifestyle and customs. [47, Behavior]

Individual Mobility (SIT) and Assimilation (BAT):
40. I don’t want to speak the language of my former country, because it makes me different from the rest of the Zabarim, and makes my Ethiopian origin conspicuous. [15, Language]
41. I like to behave like the Zabarim, because they are more open and free than the Ethiopians, who are closed. [19, Behavior]
42. Most of my friends are Zabarim because I feel more comfortable with them. I don’t feel comfortable with the Ethiopians. [21, Relationships]

Comparison with Alternative outgroup (SIT & SCT):
43. I think Ethiopian youth should identify with the Israeli culture and not with blacks in America or Jamaica [2, Relationships]

Superordinate Re-categorization (SIT & SCT):
44. I think that if we wish Israel to become a united society, it is important to have only one language—Hebrew. [38, Language]

Marginality (BAT):
45. I am not able to get along with Ethiopians or with Zabarim. [26, Relationship]
46. I can’t get by with Hebrew, but my command of Amharic is by now shaky too. [36, Language]
47. I am unable to behave like the Zabarim, nor does it suit me to behave like the Ethiopians. [41, Behavior]","47","4","4","1 (low) to 4 (high)","Sources:

Factor 1 Emotional regulation:
I do not worry very much I rarely feel anxious or fearful
I often worry about things that might go wrong I feel happy most of the time I get angry easily
Being in tense emotional situations scares me I usually feel lower than others
If I have done something wrong I want to hide from other people
People should not care what other people do

Factor 2 Openness:
I have tried to write poetry
Watching ballet or modern dance performances is boring I like to wonder about the origins of the universe
Smells remind me of old memories
When I see someone being treated unfairly, I sometimes don’t care much
I like haiku poems
I hardly ever get excited 

Factor 3 Flexibility:
I think women should have as much sexual freedom as men 
Sex education is a good thing
I would not object to my husband or wife having friends of the opposite sex
I hardly ever get excited I am a traditional person
I don’t get much pleasure from talking with people 

Factor 4 Creativity
Spanking a child is the best way to teach them
The trouble with children nowadays is their parents don’t punish them enough
My parents were always strict with me I am a traditional person
Sometimes I rearrange my room just to make it different I have tried to write poetry

     a. The head of the family should take charge of the situation. If this does not resolve the problem then it’s best for the drug user to go to a doctor or psychiatrist.
     b. The members of the family should discuss the reason drugs are used and in this way arrive together at a solution.
     c. The family should consider that the use of drugs is a personal issue, and that each individual should lead an independent life without the interference of others.

2. Three mothers talk about what they would do if they found out that their daughters were having sexual relations with their boyfriends.
     a. The first one said: I would forbid her to continue that relationship since it is against the principles her father and I have taught her.
     b. The second one said: I think she has a right to act freely without her parents’ interference.
     c. The third one said: I would speak with my daughter as if she were a friend. We would try discussing it to see if it is a mature and responsible relationship and together we would reach an agreement as to what is best for her.

3. Three young women were talking about how they would feel if their families knew that they were maintaining sexual relations with their boyfriends.
     a. The first one would see herself as belonging to a group of people who find no reason to restrict sexual relations to marriage.
     b. The second one would feel guilty for having acted against the principles that her parents have taught her.
     c. The third would consider that she has a right to live as she pleases without having to account for her behavior to anyone.

     a. Man and women should be partners. She should work if she wants to, and at the same time share the duties of the household with her husband.
     b. A woman should be a man’s complement. Thus, while he goes out to work, she should take care of the housework and the children.
     c. Women should try to achieve their own goals, without allowing their husbands or traditional ideas to limit them.

5. Three different opinions are given as to how decisions should be reached in a family: 
     a. Each member of the family should give his/her opinion and among all reach an agreement.
     b. Each member of the family should make his own decision without consulting other members of the family.
     c. The father should make the decision for the whole family.

6. Three people were talking about abortion.
     a. The first one said: Human beings should submit to natural occurring phenomena, such as pregnancy, rather than interfering with nature by means of an abortion.
     b. The second one said: One has to live in harmony with nature. Natural methods should be used to prevent pregnancy so that the harmony between man and nature is not altered as it is with abortion.
     c. The third one said: Human beings are entitled to control their lives and abortion is one method of doing this.","6","1","3","see items",NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,1,NA,"N/A","categorical","home/family,health/care,work/money/finances","values",NA,NA,NA,"general","post","1","United States of America",NA,NA,NA,"United States of America","Cuba",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cuba",NA,"1978"
