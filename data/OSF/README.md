***Description***

This respository accompanies the publication: '_The Migration Experience: A Conceptual Framework and Systematic Review of Psychological Acculturation_'. The repository contains three main components: (1) research materials that document the systematic review, (2) data files that include raw, processed, and coded sets of literature, and (3) fully annoted analysis code, including any additional analyses that go beyond the scope of the main manuscript.

## Materials

This component includes a documentation of our systematic review process. These documents aim to ensure a transparent and reproducible research process. To this end, we include documentation of our:  

1. **Search Strategy**
This appendix file documents the full search strategy of our systematic review. We discuss the development of the search terms, the bibliographic databases used, and the search procedure for the two searches, targeting the theoretical and empirical literature.
    - Search Strategy ('_Appendix-A-Search-Strategy.pdf_')

2. **Coding Protocol**
This protocol document lays out detailed information for coders of the (included) manuscripts. This document serves as an instructive manual to the coders and documents the operationalizations of the coded variables. The full manuscript selection (i.e., screening) and coding procedures (i.e., data extraction) for each of the theoretical, methodological, and empirical dataset are documented in the coding protocol.

## Data

This data component includes the main literature databases that resulted from our systematic review. The datasets fulfill two main aims. Firstly, the full records of the database inquiries aim to document the data retrieval, and screening process. Secondly, the final datasets aim to document our coding process and offer a practical database of past theories, scales, and studies on acculturation. The component thus includes the following sets of files:

1. **Literature Search**
This folder includes the full records of the literature database searches. We created two search strategies â€” one for the theoretical and one for the empirical literature on psychological acculturation (for more information see: ['Materials: Search Strategy'](#materials)). The resulting data files are:
    - Search results for theoretical literature ('_theoretical01_SearchCleaned.csv_ ')
    - Search results for empirical literature ('_empirical01_SearchCleaned.csv_ ')

2. **Literature Screening**
This folder documents the title, abstract, and full-text screening of the search results. These also include duplicate removals and coder commentary. The resulting data files are:
    - Screening of the theoretical literature ('_theoretical02_SearchScreened.csv_ ')
    - Screening of the empirical literature '_empirical02_SearchScreened.csv_ '

3. **Literature Coding**
This folder documents the full coding of the theoretical, methodological, and empirical databases that resulted from our literature searches. We also supply a codebook of the coded databases. A live interactive database of the methodological literature (i.e., with search and filter options) is available at: [www.acculturation-review.shinyapps.io/scale-directory/](https://acculturation-review.shinyapps.io/scale-directory/). The resulting data files are:
    - Coded database theoretical literature ('_theoretical03_DatabaseCoded.csv_ ')
    - Coded database methodological literature (_methodological03_DatabaseCoded.csv_)
    - Coded database empirical literature ('_theoretical03_DatabaseCoded.csv_ ')
    - Codebook ('_Acculturation-Review-Codebook.xlsx_')

1. **Scimago Journal Database (v.2019)**
This folder acts as a database version control of the exact version downloaded from the [Scimago Journal & Country Rank](https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php) that was used for our analyses. The folder includes the following types of files:
    - The full database file ('_scimagojr 2019.csv_')
    - The subject area specific database files ('_scimagojr 2019  Subject Area - [...].csv_')

_Note: Please note that due to copyright issues of the original acculturation scales some data might not be openly accessible. Please contact the author team for access and more information.
[The 'Coded database methodological literature' (see, 3) will have access restriction via a 'request access' button after peer-review.]_

## Data Analysis

This analysis component documents the methodology and results of our systematic review. This includes our data extractions, analyses, and visualizations.

1. **Annotated Analysis Script**
This analysis component includes an RMarkdown file which offers an annotated version of our full analysis process. This file offers a transparent and reproducible analysis code, which includes full author commentary. An interactive render of this documentation [here via our GitHub repository](https://janniscodes.github.io/acculturation-review/Supplemental-Material-B-Annotated-Analysis). We recommend the rendered version for almost all visitors (full R code is also available via the rendered version).
   - R Markdown Annotated Analyses ('_Supplemental-Material-B-Annotated-Analysis.Rmd_')
   - HTML render Annotated Analyses ('_Supplemental-Material-B-Annotated-Analysis.html_')

2. **Context Analysis**
This component also includes additional analyses and their documentation. Notably, this includes our conceptualization of the acculturation context and an analysis of the contextual elements within the systematic review.
   - Context Analysis ('_Supplemental-Material-C-Experience-Context.pdf_')
