Aim: The purpose of this study is to analyse acculturation strategies and attitudes in different life domains of native and immigrant adults living in Italy, following the Relative Acculturation Extended Model (RAEM). Methods: The participants were 250 Italian native and 100 immigrant adults who completed a questionnaire with items to measure their acculturation strategies (real plane) and attitudes (ideal plane), in general and related to different life domains (peripheral and central). Results: Results revealed that the acculturation attitude of immigrants is integration, whereas Italians prefer their assimilation. Conclusion: However, when different life domains are taken into account, immigrants claim to put in practice and prefer integration in most of the domains, whereas Italians perceive immigrants are separated but they prefer their assimilation or integration, depending on the specific domain.

Scientific progress in the study of immigrant integration has been hampered by the lack of a common measure of integration, which would allow for the accumulation of knowledge through comparison across studies, countries, and time. To address this fundamental problem, we propose the Immigration Policy Lab (IPL) Integration Index as a pragmatic and multidimensional measure of immigrant integration. The measure, both in the 12-item short form (IPL-12) and the 24-item long form (IPL-24), captures six dimensions of integration: psychological, economic, political, social, linguistic, and navigational. The measure can be used across countries, over time, and across different immigrant groups and can be administered through short questionnaires available in different modes. We report on four surveys we conducted to evaluate the empirical performance of our measure. The tests reveal that the measure distinguishes among immigrant groups with different expected levels of integration and also correlates with well-established predictors of integration.

Each of these studies concerns their sense of purpose, acculturation experiences, and identity development in relation to their educational and occupational achievements, as well as their psychological wellbeing over time. For the qualitative analysis, the participants were interviewed during two different phases of the study. The first set of in-depth individual interviews was conducted in 2007 (Phase 1) with 19 South Sudanese URMs who had resettled in the United States in 2001. From 2014--2015 (Phase 2), 11 of the 19 participants from Phase 1 were interviewed again. Using a modified grounded theory approach, these two sets of qualitative data were analyzed in terms of the participants' purpose development, multidimensional acculturation, identity reformation and integration, educational and occupational achievements, and overall life satisfaction. There are three theoretical frameworks that guide the current research project: a) Damon's purpose-development theory, b) Ferguson's tridimensional acculturation theory, and c) Portes and Zhou's segmented assimilation theory. Based on these three existing theories and their measurements, this study attempts to describe South Sudanese URMs' identified goals, life purposes, major achievements (especially in terms of education and occupation), changes and modifications to their goals, resettlement challenges, social barriers, and how these factors have influenced their long-term adjustment in the U.S. This study's findings reveal the prevalence of an other-oriented/beyond-the-self (BTS) purpose among the South Sudanese URMs that helped them to overcome resettlement challenges and promote positive adjustment and psychological wellbeing. The findings also describe how their process of purpose development was closely related to and influenced by their four-dimensional acculturation experiences, with identity reformation and integration providing insights into their educational and occupational achievements and general life satisfaction as the determinants of long-term adjustment. In the following complementary quantitative study, a questionnaire was developed using existing scales and measurements to evaluate the levels of general purpose and BTS purpose, variables of resettlement challenges such as emotional strain and perceived discrimination, and key adjustment outcomes such as educational and occupational attainment. As a result of multiple regression analyses, the moderation effect of prosocial purpose was found to be statistically significant in promoting better adjustment outcomes by buffering the negative impact of resettlement challenges.

The present study adopts an ecological approach to investigate how refugees perceive the welcoming climate in Germany and the consequences of this perception. To further explore the refugeesâ€™ situation, we examined several predictors of their psychological adjustment and acculturation attitudes. In a field study in Eastern Germany with N = 94 refugees as participants, we assessed the perceived context of reception, and perceived acculturation attitudes as contextual variables, discrimination and contact as intergroup variables and, on the individual level, psychological adjustment as well as the personal acculturation attitudes as dependent variables. The results revealed that more perceived discrimination resulted in an increase in reported psychological problems. Refugees living in asylum centers reported more psychological problems and more perceived discrimination than those living in independent housing. The perceived context of reception positively predicted refugeesâ€™ desire for maintenance of intergroup relations with the host society. Positive intergroup contact lowered their desire for cultural maintenance. In sum, this study gives us rare and valuable insight into refugeesâ€™ perspectives in the context of recent immigration to Germany. In doing so, it emphasizes the importance of a welcoming climate. The study shows how meaningful the assessment of the perceived context of reception is. Practical implications for fields such as the accommodation of refugees are discussed.

Method(s): A cross-sectional study was conducted in Queensland, Australia. A total of 382 first-generation young adult (aged 20â€“39 years) ME migrants completed a self-administered questionnaire. The hypothesised model was tested through a two-step process: measurement, and structural model testing. First, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was applied to test the fit of the measurement model and reliability and validity indices were calculated. Structural Equations Modelling (SEM) was then used to test the structural model. The significance of the mediating effect was tested using bootstrapping method. Results: Mainstream acculturation had the greatest accumulated total effect on PWB through both a direct and an indirect effect via perceived discrimination. Ethnic acculturation had the second greatest total effect on PWB, with both a direct effect and indirect effects through perceived social support and perceived discrimination. Perceived discrimination demonstrated both a direct effect and an indirect effect on PWB through perceived social support. Perceived social support had only a direct effect on PWB. Conclusions: Facilitating ME migrantsâ€™ active participation in both ethnic and mainstream societies is important. Moreover, developing ethnic communities associations and resources could be an effective option to provide social support to ME migrants and in turn to improve their PWB. To provide ME migrants with better mental health outcomes, there is still a need to minimize the discrimination against them.

While acculturation has been identified as an important factor in adjustment of Vietnamese immigrants (Birman and Tran in Am J Orthopsychiatr 78(1):109â€“120. doi: 10.1037/0002-9432.78.1.109 , 2008), no clear pattern of findings has emerged and too few studies have employed an ecological approach. The purpose of this paper is to contextualize the study of acculturation and adjustment by taking an ecological approach to exploring these relationships across several life domains, using a bilinear scale, and examining mediators of these relationships for adult Vietnamese refugees (N = 203) in the United States. We call this approach the Ecological Acculturation Framework (EAF). Results of a structural equation model (SEM) showed that job satisfaction fully mediated the relationship between American acculturation and psychological distress, demonstrating that this relationship was specific to an occupational domain. However, while Vietnamese acculturation predicted co-ethnic social support satisfaction, it did not predict reduced psychological distress. Implications for a life domains approach, including domain specificity, are discussed.

Results from a content analysis of open-ended surveys collected from 159 refugees show that the most frequently reported refugee vocational stressor was access and opportunity (31% of comments made about vocational stressors). This meta-theme encompasses feeling as though past work experience is discounted in the job search, struggles with the job search, and exploitation (e.g., low pay). Other meta-themes included acculturative, discrimination, interpersonal, financial and personal vocational stressors. Qualitative accounts of coping revealed reflection and relaxation (25%) and problem-solving actions (24%) as the most commonly reported coping mechanisms. In addition, refugee-specific coping mechanisms (17%) were frequently reported, and referred to building language skills, engaging in assimilation and multicultural activities, and seeking social support from other refugees. Using the meta-themes that emerged in each vocational stressor category, t-test results show that the experience of discrimination stressors was related to higher levels of self-reported anxiety, depression and sleep disturbances. In addition, the use of avoidance-oriented coping mechanisms was associated with maladaptive outcomes, such as depression, sleep disturbances, and anxiety. Taken together, our results indicate that refugees face many of the vocational stressors typically studied in the occupational health literature (e.g., underemployment). The current study also uncovered unique vocational stressors and coping mechanisms, including evidence for a refugee-specific stigma experienced during the job search process and among refugees who are currently employed.

The mediating effect of hopelessness and moderating effect of secure attachment are also examined. A total of 185 Turkish migrants living in the Netherlands were recruited through social media and through liaison with community groups. They completed an online survey including validated measures of suicidal ideation, hopelessness, acculturation and attachment style. Mediation and moderation analyses were tested using bootstrapping. Higher participation was associated with less hopelessness and less suicidal ideation. Greater maintenance of one's ethnic culture was associated with higher hopelessness and higher suicidal ideation. Greater participation was associated with less suicidal ideation particularly amongst those with less secure attachment styles.

Effect of exposure to the U.S. culture and Western diets and prevalence of chronic diseases were examined. Acculturation was measured using the Iranian Acculturation Scale, and total acculturation score is calculated. Dietary patterns were measured using the Block Brief Food Questionnaire (BFQ), total foods and beverages consumed over the past year, as specified in BBFQ, were studied. Two hundred seven (N = 207) Iranian American immigrants completed the acculturation, food frequency and socio-demographic questionnaires. All participants were born in Iran, were 18 years of age or older and had lived more than one year in the U.S. About 37.5% of participants had acculturation scores indicating Iranian values; the majority (62.5%) had either adapted American values (26.5%) or had combined some American values (36%). Results indicate age at arrival, length of stay, English fluency, education and income are major factors determining level of acculturation, dietary patterns and prevalence of chronic diseases among Iranian American immigrants. Consumption of Western diet and level of acculturation was less among participants who lived longer (> 10 years) in the U.S. and were older when they arrived to the US. The rate of family history of diabetes among participants was 39.1%., though 9% had pre-diabetes and 4% reported being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. A majority of the participants (87%) reported no secondary health concerns related to dietary intake. As Iranian American immigrants grow older their consumption of red meats, fast foods, soft drinks, potatoes, salty snacks, refined grains and sweets were significantly decreased and they consumed more vegetables. Given growing Iranian immigrants in U.S., a deep understanding of factors influencing dietary patterns of Iranian immigrates is necessary. Our study with small sample size (207) has several limitations, which should be rectified by future researchers. Therefore, conclusion about association between level of acculturation, dietary patterns and prevalence of chronic diseases among participants is limited. New Iranian immigrants especially those with school-aged children may become more aware of consumption of Western diet and ill effects on their overall wellbeing.

Immigrantsâ€™ changes and maintenance of their cultures, a process known as acculturation, has been postulated to explain differences in wellbeing. However, the mechanisms by which acculturation impacts wellbeing are not fully understood. This study sought to understand the relation between acculturation and wellbeing through a person-environment fit lens, with the hypothesis that the better immigrants can acculturate in ways they prefer (e.g., taking on the practices, values, and identifications they desire), the better their self-reported wellbeing. An explanatory mixed-method approach was used to examine this hypothesis. Four hundred thirty-eight Latinx immigrants (ages 18â€“77, M = 37.88) who had lived in the United States for less than a year to 55 years (M = 16.75 years) completed survey measures in Arizona, New Mexico, Maryland, and Virginia. A subset (n = 73) participated in 12 focus groups. The sample included naturalized citizens (31.0%) along with authorized (33.2%) and unauthorized (35.8%) immigrants, and matched community immigration patterns. Data were analyzed through path analyses and constructivist grounded theory methods. Results indicated that the better Latinx immigrants could acculturate in the ways they preferred, the better their wellbeing. This relation was explained, in part, through lower levels of acculturative stress. This research suggests that practitioners and policymakers should consider ways to support immigrants to acculturate in the ways they desire as opposed to solely focusing their efforts on particular acculturation strategies.

This study used a modified questionnaire consistent with a multidimensional model to examine behavioral acculturation, psychological acculturation and psychological well-being across generations of Vietnamese immigrants and refugees living in the U.S. Sociodemographic and migrant variables were used to investigate their relationships to behavioral and psychological acculturation toward the U.S. and Vietnamese dimensions and psychological well-being across generations of Vietnamese. Using a quasi-experimental design, data were collected from 590 Vietnamese immigrants and refugees living in the U.S. Multiple regression analyses were calculated to determine the amount of variance accounted for in behavioral and psychological acculturation toward the U.S. dimension and psychological well-being. Results suggested that sociodemographic variables of Income, Religion, Current Age, Education in the U.S., Education in Vietnam, and Gender, as well as migrant variables of Generational Status, Age of Arrival, and Reason for Migration were significant predictors of behavioral acculturation of the U.S. Dimension. Psychological acculturation of the U.S. dimension was also shown to be predictable by sociodemographic variables, such as Income, Education in Vietnam, and Occupation, and migrant variables that included Proportion of Life in the U.S. and Reason for Migration. Other results supported past research that first generation immigrants and refugees tended to practice more customs of the Vietnamese observable behaviors and are more likely to have similar values and preferences for the Vietnamese culture compared to individuals who were born in the U.S. or who entered at the U.S. before the age of 8. However, contrary to past research, the results showed no direct relationship between emotional distress and acculturation toward the Vietnamese culture. Consistent with a bipolar model, a negative relationship was detected between behavioral acculturation of the U.S. and Vietnamese dimensions. An unexpected outcome was observed in psychological acculturation, where a significant positive relationship occurred between the U.S. and Vietnamese dimensions.

The Pew Research Center (2017b) reported that in 2015, approximately 11 million of these were undocumented immigrants. Research has suggested that the mental health of Hispanics is indisputably connected to the immigration experience. Counselors predict that the impact of current political and societal disputes surrounding this population is having a detrimental effect on their mental health and, more specifically, their stress level. Clinicians and, therefore, counselor educators are called upon to the psychological needs of ethnic populations such as Hispanics from a framework that addresses cultural values, communication styles, and socioeconomic factors. Therefore, it is imperative that researchers work to provide counselor educators and clinicians with the tools necessary to assess, diagnose, treat, and support Hispanic clients. This study sought to examine how relevant stressors such as documentation status, spiritual coping, and acculturation precede stress and contribute to that literature. The sample in this study included 139 foreign-born adult Hispanics. The sample was recruited from the researchers established network with two local churches and a local health clinic, all with a predominantly Hispanic representation. Participants responded to the survey in person, anonymously. The complete survey included the Abbreviated Version of the Hispanic Stress Inventory for Immigrants, Spiritual Coping Strategies Scale, and the Psychological Acculturation Scale, and a demographic questionnaire, totaling 58 questions. A standard regression analysis was used to analyze the data, which indicated that documentation status, spiritual coping, and acculturation did not contribute to stress levels in the sample. Findings indicated a small correlation between documentation status and stress and no correlation with the other two variables.

This mixed-methods study conducted among Afghan and Iraqi refugee and asylum-seeker psychiatric patients aims to fill this gap. Associations between postmigration stress, symptoms of anxiety and depression disorders, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder were significant. When differentiated for the two groups, associations with postmigration stress were no longer significant for Afghan patients, who were predominantly younger and more often single, lower educated, and without resident status compared with Iraqi patients. Qualitative results indicate that, in addition to psychopathology and postmigration stress, acculturation problems contribute to confusion of cultural identity. The findings suggest that reduction of postmigration stress and acculturation problems may clarify cultural identity and as such may contribute to posttraumatic recovery.

Moroccan, Pakistani, Ecuadorian, and Romanian immigrants residing in Barcelona nominated 25 individuals (i.e., alters) from their habitual social networks and provided demographic (e.g., ethnicity), relationship type (e.g., family, friend, neighbor), and structural (who knew whom) information for each of these alters. Even after controlling for individual-level demographic and acculturation variables, the content and structure of immigrantsâ€™ personal social networks had unique associations with both types of adjustment and with BII. Specifically, the overall degree of cultural diversity in the network and the amount of Catalan (but not Spanish) 'weak' ties (i.e., acquaintances, colleagues, neighbors) positively predicted these outcomes. Amount of interconnectedness between local coethnic and Catalan/Spanish alters also predicted sociocultural adjustment and BII positively. Finally, against a 'culture and language similarity' hypothesis, Moroccan and Pakistani participants had social networks that were more culturally integrated, relative to Ecuadorians and Romanians. Results from this study attest to the importance of examining actual intercultural relations and going beyond individualsâ€™ reported acculturation preferences to understand immigrantsâ€™ overall adaptation and cultural identity dynamics.

Findings revealed that both acculturation strategies of one group and relative 'fit' between immigrant and host society strategy preference were predictive of intergroup relations. In general, a strategy of integration was associated with more favorable intergroup relations in both groups, and a mismatch between host and immigrant preferred strategies yielded the most negative outcomes.

Academic self-efficacy, acculturation, family obligation, and perceived social support have been identified as being relevant to college students' achievement motivation. However, limited research is available regarding the potential impact of these factors on the achievement motivation of undocumented college students (i.e., DREAMers), which is a population with poor college enrollment and retention rates. The primary purpose of this study was to explore the extent to which these factors influenced achievement motivation in documented and undocumented Latinx college students. Participants who identified as documented Latinx college students (N = 160) or DREAMers (N = 84) completed an online survey consisting of a demographic questionnaire, Academic Motivation Scale - College Version, Academic Self-Efficacy Subscale, Short Acculturation Scale for Hispanics, Family Obligation Scale, and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. A series of multiple regression analyses indicated that social support was a significant predictor of extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, and family obligation was a significant predictor of intrinsic motivation in documented students. Acculturation and academic self-efficacy were significant predictors of DREAMers' intrinsic motivation and amotivation, respectively. The implications and limitations of these findings are discussed.

Given the current socio-political climate and the limited research, the present exploratory study explores the relationship between acculturation, ethnic identity, self-identity, generational status, religiosity, and demographics among adult Australian Muslims. A cross-sectional convenience sample of 324 adult Australian Muslims completed either online or paper-based questionnaires in either English or Arabic. Recruitment was via convenience sampling and social media advertisements. Acculturation, ethnic identity (MEIM), religiosity, and demographic variables were measured. The study sample was young and mostly female, with high religiosity levels. Acculturation was negatively correlated with ethnic identity. From multiple regression analysis, acculturation was predicted independently by religiosity (low), age (young), gender (male) and ethnic identity (low). First generation Australian Muslims were older, had stronger ethnic identity and religiosity, and more commonly self-identified as non-Australian. By contrast second- and third-generation were more likely to self-identify as bicultural or Australian. In summary, acculturation of Australian Muslims is influenced by multiple variables, particularly ethnic identity, religiosity, and generation; hence all these variables need to be included in policy regarding successful integration of migrants.

This study assessed potential mediating factors that may explain these associations among 75 healthy MA adults [age: 37.5 (9.3) y; 65.3% female]. Methods: Secondary data analysis using hierarchical logistic regression examined whether perceived environmental barriers, social support, and intention to exercise potentially mediated relationships between acculturation level, and total and leisure-time moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA). Data were collected via questionnaire. Results: Most participants (67%) reported lower average household monthly incomes ($0â€“$3000), completed some college or obtained a college degree (64.4%), and were first generation immigrants (59%). Acculturation was associated with greater odds of engaging in total MVPA [odds ratio (OR) = 1.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2â€“2.4] and leisure-time MVPA (OR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1â€“1.2).

Conclusions: Results provide preliminary evidence for mediating factors that may explain the relationship between acculturation level and PA among MA adults.

Less is known about (a) how acculturation explains differences in family relationships by time in the US, and (b) whether acculturative stressors influence different aspects of immigrantsâ€™ family relationships. Drawing on an expanded acculturation framework, we explore whether and how attitudinal familism, family contact, and family conflict among immigrant Latina/os vary based on acculturation and acculturative stressors. Method: Using nationally representative data on foreign-born Latina/os (National Latino and Asian American Study; N = 1,618), ordered logistic and OLS regression analyses examined whether differences in family relationships by time in the US are explained by acculturation factors, and whether acculturative stressors are associated with family relationships when controlling for other important sociodemographic factors. Results: Accounting for acculturation reduces the effect of time in the US on attitudinal familism and family conflict to nonsignificance. Spanish language proficiency and ethnic identity are associated with higher attitudinal familism, while English proficiency is associated with increased family conflict. Additionally, acculturative stressors (involuntary context of exit, hostile context of reception, limited origin country ties) are associated with lower attitudinal familism and higher conflict. Conclusions: Results highlight the importance of (a) examining the ways that migration influences multiple aspects of family relationships, (b) adopting a more comprehensive acculturation framework.

We aimed to examine the association of acculturation, i.e. the adaptation of immigrants to a new cultural context, and depressive and anxiety symptoms in immigrant chronic dialysis patients. Methods: The DIVERS study is a prospective cohort study in five urban dialysis centers in the Netherlands. The association of five aspects of acculturation ('Skills', 'Social integration', 'Traditions', 'Values and norms' and 'Loss') and the presence of depressive and anxiety symptoms was determined using linear regression analyses, both univariate and multivariate. Results: A total of 249 immigrant chronic dialysis patients were included in the study. The overall prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 51% and 47%, respectively. 'Skills' and 'Loss' were significantly associated with the presence of depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively ('Skills' Î² = 0.34, CI: 0.11â€“0.58, and 'Loss' Î² = 0.19, CI: 0.01â€“0.37; 'Skills' Î² = 0.49, CI: 0.25â€“0.73, and 'Loss' Î² = 0.33, CI: 0.13â€“0.53). The associations were comparable after adjustment. No significant associations were found between the other subscales and depressive and anxiety symptoms.

Inability to fully integrate into the labor force in the 1st 6 mo in Canada was attributed mainly to lack of competence in both official languages, difficulty in getting credentials and accreditations recognized in Canada, and lack of Canadian work experience. In time, these barriers were overcome. In their place, market conditions (e.g., economic recession) delayed full participation in the work force.

Meanwhile, the high socioeconomic status of some new immigrant groups also challenges the classical assumption that ties to co-ethnic community are associated with deviance. With a sample (n = 960) collected from a population of Chinese students in a large public university in the U.S., we tested how do the interplays between acculturation and co-ethnic ties affect substance use. This study establishes that: (1) different dimensions of acculturation have opposite effects on substance use; (2) acculturative stress does not explain the association between acculturation and substance use; (3) acculturation increases the likelihood of substance use only when one has weak attachment to their co-ethnic community. The findings are consistent for three dependent variables: smoking, drinking, and drunkenness, and for the different constructs of acculturation and co-ethnic ties. Ties to co-ethnic community may provide important social support for immigrants, while acculturation may alleviate the insular subculture that promotes at-risk behaviors. We encourage policy makers to consider the cooperative nature of acculturation and cultural retention for the improvement of health among this growing population.

Attachment theory can help us understand how immigrants develop adaptive ways of relating, as well as coping with change and loss inherent in the migration process. This study utilized a non-experimental, quantitative, correlational method and the sample consisted of 64 participants. They were administered a Demographics Questionnaire, Iranian Acculturation Scale, Relationship Scale Questionnaire, Brief Symptom Inventory-18, and Satisfaction With Life Scale. The data collected was analyzed using a Pearson-moment correlation, multiple regressions, as well as a mediation analysis to determine if level of acculturation is a mediator between attachment and psychological distress. Findings indicated that an individual's attachment style was more predictive of psychological distress than their degree of acculturation but both attachment and acculturation significantly predicted psychological distress and satisfaction with life. Specifically, fearful and preoccupied attachment scores significantly predicted higher report of symptoms and thus lower psychological distress. There was no significant relationship between attachment and acculturation nor between secure attachment and psychological distress. Furthermore, the independent variables (i.e., attachment styles) did not significantly predict the mediator (i.e., acculturation).

According to Ward and colleagues, both psychological and sociocultural adaptation change at different rates and extend into later life. For this study, participants 50+ years of age and born in Iran completed questionnaires measuring life satisfaction, depressive symptoms, acculturation, and demographic and sociocultural variables (e.g., pre- and post-immigration occupational status). We collected study data anonymously in Persian to obtain responses from long-term residents of Canada as well as more recent immigrants who may not read or write English. We examined both life satisfaction and (the absence of) depressive symptoms as distinct forms of psychological adaptation; these emerged as independent predictors of acculturation. Contrary to theory, acculturation appears to predict life satisfaction, not vice versa; moreover, there seems to be no direct link between depressive symptoms and acculturation. Our findings suggest that integration within Canadian society is associated with higher life satisfaction. In contrast, sociocultural factors are indirectly associated with life satisfaction (except age) and acculturation (except ethnic diversity of social interactions). Involuntary migrants reported higher levels of depression, whereas loss of occupational status is associated with reduced life satisfaction.

"44","Search2020","thesis",2017,"Lee, Jin Hee","Depression among Korean immigrants: The influence of acculturation and social support",1,NA,"Introduction: Depression is prevalent among U.S. immigrants, including Korean immigrants. However, little is known about factors that may contribute to their depression. Preliminary evidence suggests that less acculturated individuals are at greater risk for depression but that social support may buffer any negative effects of less acculturation. The aims of this study were to examine the relationship between acculturation and depressive symptoms among Korean immigrants and the moderating role of social support. Methods: A convenience sample of 132 adult Korean immigrants completed 6 self-report measures: the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, a Korean version of the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans-II, the Multi-Dimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, the Perceived Stress Scale, the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status, and a demographic questionnaire. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to examine the aims, controlling for covariates. Results: 31% of the sample met the criteria for being depressed. Greater acculturation was associated with more depressive symptoms while greater social support was a significant predictor of fewer symptoms. Social support was more strongly related to less depression among immigrants who were less acculturated than among immigrants who were more acculturated, but this difference was not significant. Perceived stress was the most significant predictor of depression. Older age at immigration and less education were also related to greater depression. Variables in the regression model accounted for 65% of the variance in predicting depression. Conclusions: Findings indicate a high prevalence of depressive symptoms in this Korean immigrant sample. Results also suggest that acculturation per se may not play a major role in depressive symptoms but rather more specific factors associated with acculturation such as age at immigration and educational levels. These factors should be studied in future research, along with efforts to better understand the causes of stress and impaired social networks in this population. Findings point to a need for regular assessment of depression by health care providers as well as the stress and social support available in a Korean immigrant's life. Results also suggest that community-based prevention programs to address these problems may be warranted.

Methods: A total of n = 90 patients with different ethnic backgrounds from an outpatient consultation service for immigrants at the Hannover Medical School were investigated by the Hannover Migration and Mental Health Interview (HMMH), the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Frankfurt Acculturation Scale (FRAKK). Results: The majority of the subjects (84.4%) had a clinically significant depression. The extent of depressive symptoms was determined by the selected acculturation style (1) (F = 3.29, p = .025): Subjects with integration as acculturation style showed less depressive symptoms than subjects with assimilation as acculturation style. Furthermore, subjects with segregation as acculturation style also showed less depressive symptoms than subjects with assimilation. Conclusion: The results suggest that even when undergoing extreme emotional distress, eventually leading to mental disorder, integration, as an acculturation style, seems to serve as a protective resource and possibly prevents further decline.

Intercultural contacts in the group of Russians was positively related to the expectation of integration and negatively related to the expectation of assimilation. The integration strategy of the migrants was positively related to their self-esteem, while the assimilation strategy was positively related to their sociocultural adaptation and life satisfaction. Among the Russians, the integration expectation promoted their better life satisfaction and self-esteem. The multiculturalism hypothesis was partially supported with both the migrants from Central Asia and the Russians: perceived security promoted an acceptance of multicultural ideology but didnâ€™t promote ethnic tolerance. The contact hypothesis was partially supported in both groups: interethnic contacts were positively linked to the integration strategy of the migrants and the integration expectations of the Russians. The integration hypothesis was fully supported in the sample of Russians and partially supported in the sample of migrants. The migrantsâ€™ adoption of the assimilation strategy promoted their life satisfaction and sociocultural adaptation.

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of age and spiritual well-being to acculturation and general health outcomes. The study employed a cross-sectional design and a convenience sampling method. Data was collected from 62 Romanian immigrant adults in the greater Sacramento, California region. The instruments used to collect data were a demographic form, the Spiritual Well-Being Scale, the Stephenson Multigroup Acculturation Scale, and the General Health Questionnaire. All instruments were translated into Romanian, the native language of the participants, by the researcher who is fluent in both English and Romanian. Five hypotheses were developed: (a) Participants who immigrated at a younger age will have higher levels of acculturation, (b) Participants who immigrated at a younger age will report better general health outcomes, (c) Participants with higher levels of spiritual well-being will report better physical and psychological health, (d) Participants who will report higher levels of spiritual will also report higher levels of acculturation, and (e) Orthodox participants will present with lower levels of acculturation. Since all of the variables included in each analysis were categorical, chi-square analyses were conducted to test the research hypothesis. The results of this dissertation supported two of the hypothesis: age at immigration seems to affect the level of acculturation and spiritual well-being seems to affect physical health. The finding which did not support the hypothesis showed that there is no significant relationship between age at immigration and the level of physical and psychological health; spiritual well-being and the level of acculturation, and psychological health; and religious affiliation and the level of acculturation. This study provides additional information that may help explain Romanian immigrants' acculturation experience, spiritual well-being and general health outcomes.

Informed by Bornsteinâ€™s Specificity Principle in Acculturation Science, acculturation was defined by levels of: language acquisition, having realised/met expectations, and self-identification with host country. Using a cross-sectional study design, a convenience sample of English-speaking participants was recruited through a link on a well-known English-language internet site targeting immigrants to Israel. Due to the diversity of respondents, only questionnaires completed by immigrants from the following four countries were included (n = 641): Canada (n = 40), South Africa (n = 66), the United Kingdom (n = 132) and the United States (n = 403). Life satisfaction only was linked to the acculturation variable of having a higher level of realised expectations for life after immigration and reporting good health, but not associated with the other acculturation variables of language acquisition or self-identification with host country. While having realised expectations was related to life satisfaction, the number of years in the host country and language acquisition was not. Having realistic expectations (related to greater life satisfaction) may be increased by providing prospective immigrants information on the new countryâ€™s culture while they are still in the host country and planning their immigration.

The research was based on data of temporary immigrants (sojourners), being international students who reside in the Netherlands and participants of a Dutch language course (total N = 163). Questionnaires were used to collect data at two time points (time lag: 3 months). Findings from multiple regression analyses reveal that an increase in L2 proficiency is related to a positive change in two indicators of cultural integration: identification with the host society and attitudes towards the host culture. An increase in L2 proficiency appears to be related to a positive change in terms of identification, regardless of sojournersâ€™ personality traits. With respect to attitudes towards the host culture, however, we find that increasing L2 proficiency only goes together with a positive change in attitudes towards the host culture for sojourners with a high degree of social initiative. Another notable finding is that, in the time period that this study was conducted, sojourners with a high degree of openness became more positive in their attitudes towards the host culture, regardless of the progress they made in terms of L2 proficiency. Results from this study cautiously suggest the importance of social perceptual personality traits in the cultural integration of sojourners. In line with this, institutional policies on the L2 learning of sojourners, including the training of social perceptual personality traits, could be recommendable.

In a sample of 349 immigrants living in Germany (199 Turks and 150 North-Africans), we investigated the influence of emotional intelligence (EI) with the Trait-Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS). Acculturation styles were assessed with the Acculturation Attitudes Scale (AAS) as well as specific markers of acculturation behavior. Adjustment was captured by the Satisfaction with life scale (SWLS), the subjective happiness scale (SHS), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) as an inverse marker. Additionally, we assessed perceived unfairness and discrimination. Findings show that EI and its subcomponents are related to beneficial forms of acculturation attitudes and acculturation behavior. EI was also shown to affect acculturation experiences, such as perceived discrimination and perceived unfairness, as well as a number of psychological adjustment variables.

Recently cross-cultural researchers have tended to focus on certain psychological and social moderators of stress that differentiate between migrants perceiving higher stress and those remaining relatively unscathed. The present study examined the moderating impact of coping resources (sense of coherence and perceived social support) and coping strategies (problem-focused and emotion-focused) on the relationship between acculturative stress and psychological wellbeing (positive functioning and negative health outcomes) in stress-coping model. On a final sample of 308 Pakistani immigrants residing in Greater Toronto Area a series of moderated hierarchical regression analyses were performed separately for positive and negative health outcomes. Results indicated that sense of coherence and perceived social support moderated between acculturative stress and positive functioning (self-acceptance, positive relations with others, autonomy, environmental mastery, purpose in life, personal growth), and acculturative stress and negative health outcomes (depression, psychosomatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia, social dysfunction).The current findings have implications for clinicians, researchers, and policy makers for the identification of resource factors that help to understand the resistant power of growing immigrant population to maintain positive functioning.

In line with collective action research, a cross-sectional questionnaire study (N =84) among Senegalese migrants in Paris (France) and Geneva (Switzerland) examined three pathways to transnational political involvement (motivations and actual behaviour). Perceived discrimination, the grievances pathway, was positively related to both transnational motivations (but only when desire to adopt the receiving culture was low) and political behaviour in Senegal. Desire to adopt the culture of the receiving society as an acculturation preference, the embeddedness pathway, was also positively linked to transnational motivations and political behaviour. Finally, desire to maintain the culture of origin as an acculturation preferenceâ€”the collective identification pathwayâ€”was unrelated to transnational political involvement. These findings underscore the compatibility of transnational political involvement in countries of origin and adaptation to receiving societies.

Sixty-nine first-generation Iranian-American immigrants residing in Los Angeles between the ages of 18 and 65 completed the following measures: (1) a demographic questionnaire; (2) Iranian Acculturation Scale. Statistical analysis of the data gathered provided overall support for the reliability and validity of the Iranian Acculturation Scale (IAS), although some differences in findings between the current study and the original test study of the scale by Shahim were also apparent.

First, we aimed at determining how acculturation preferences and emotions were related to specific intergroup behavioural tendencies towards majority and minority groups. Second, we aimed at developing an intergroup behavioural tendencies scale that differentiates between valence (facilitation and harm) and intensity (active and passive). The role of intergroup contact was also examined, as it is a known predictor of intergroup prejudice. In order to fulfil these goals, we carried out two studies. In Study 1, Spanish participants (N = 279) answered a questionnaire about Moroccans (a devalued group) or Ecuadorians (a valued group) by reporting their acculturation preferences for immigrants, their positive and negative emotions, quantity of contact with them and behavioural tendencies towards them. In Study 2, Moroccans (N = 92) and Ecuadorians (N = 87) assessed Spaniards on these measures. Results confirmed the structure of the new behavioural tendencies scale across four groups of participants. Overall, findings also showed that acculturation preferences and quantity of contact indirectly predicted behavioural tendencies through positive emotions. This research contributes to knowledge on how the majority and minority's acculturation preferences are related to their emotions and specific dimensions of intergroup behavioural tendencies, confirming the predominant mediating role of positive emotions in this process.

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine relationships among demographic characteristics, acculturation, psychological resilience, social support and symptoms of depression and distress in Albanian and Bulgarian adult immigrants in Greece. Random samples of 404 adult economical immigrants and 376 Greeks citizens, equated by age and sex, completed the following: the Talbieh Brief Distress Inventory (TDBI), the CES-D, two self-administered measures designed to detect distress and depressive symptoms in cross cultural research, the Resilience Scale (RS), a 25-item instrument that assess resilience as a personality style, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), designed to assess perceptions of social support adequacy from family, friends and significant others. The immigrants also completed the Schmitz's Multicultural Ideology Scale, which assess the acculturation styles applied by immigrants to adjust to a new country (Integration, Assimilation, Separation and Marginalization), as well as a questionnaire about the process of acculturation. Findings include very high scores of depression in immigrants compared to the host population. The number of years since arrival to Greece seem to be unrelated to distress and depression. Additionally, the age of immigrants, the number of children, the lower level of social support from friends and family, and the lower score in Resilience Scale seem to be risk factors for psychological distress, whereas the lower educational level, the residence of the immigrant in the Athens area, the female gender and the lower level of social support from friends and family seems to predict high levels of depression.

In order to fulfil this goal, 150 immigrant people of Romanian origin (49.3% male) with a mean age of 35.33 years (SD = 11.84) answered a questionnaire, which included the aforementioned variables. Results show that social support has a positive indirect effect on the degree of adoption of Spanish customs (both in public and private domains) by Romanian immigrants through a reduction of their perceived discrimination. Besides, social support has no effect on Romanian immigrantsâ€™ maintenance of home society customs.

Specifically, we explored the impact of race-based rejection sensitivity on well-being, and whether cultural identity clarity could help curtail any negative effects. Hypothesis 1 was that race-based rejection sensitivity would be negatively associated with well-being. Hypothesis 2 was that cultural identity clarity would moderate the association between race-based rejection sensitivity and well-being such that Latino/a immigrants lower in cultural identity clarity would experience poorer well-being than those higher in cultural identity clarity. Method: A community sample of Latino/a immigrants (N = 136; Mage = 38.21; 51.47% female) completed a survey including measures of race-based rejection sensitivity, cultural identity clarity, bicultural stress, self-esteem, and life satisfaction. Results: Correlation and regression analyses revealed that race-based rejection sensitivity was negatively associated with well-being. Additionally, high cultural identity clarity attenuated the negative association between race-based rejection sensitivity and well-being.

While each refugee group has its own set of challenges when adjusting to a new country, a better understanding of their needs may help facilitate their transition more quickly with lesser challenges. This study investigated the adjustment of one such groupâ€”Somali Bantus in a Midwestern U.S. city. Specifically, acculturation and school adaptation of Somali Bantu refugee children was explored using the Differentiated Multidimensional Model of Acculturation. Somali Bantu refugee children in 5 elementary schools were asked to complete a questionnaire that assessed their level of acculturation to American culture and level of retention of Somali Bantu culture, at three levels i.e. language, identity, and behavior. The 5 ESL teachers were asked to complete a questionnaire that assessed total difficulties in behaviors for each of their Somali Bantu student. Correlations, MANOVAs, and hierarchical regression analyses were used to analyze the data. The findings of this study documented the significant role of school context in the acculturation and school adaptation of these Somali Bantu refugee children. The findings demonstrated that age was statistically, significantly, and negatively related to overall American Acculturation (AAI) and statistically, significantly, and positively related to Proficiency Level Composite scores. These students' AAI scores were statistically, significantly, and positively related to their Somali Acculturation Index (SAI) scores. Furthermore, SAI scores were statistically, significantly, and positively related to grades on Social Behavior and grades on Social Behavior and Work Study Habits were statistically, significantly, and positively related. Also, age and length of time in the country were statistically, significantly, and positively related. The hierarchical regression analyses for AAI and ABA suggested that the demographic variables age, length of time in the US and gender did not contribute to any significant variance and school contributed a moderate variance to the overall AAI and ABA scores. School contributed substantially more incremental variance to ALA and AIA than did the other variables (age, length of time in the US and gender). Overall, the theoretical model including age, length of time in the US, gender and school explained 18, 25, 17 and 13 percent of the variance in the AAI, ALA, AIA and ABA respectively. The hierarchical regression analyses for SAI, SLA, SIA and SBA suggested that the demographic variables age, length of time in the US and gender contributed marginally significant variance. School contributed substantially more incremental variance to SAI, SLA and SBA and a small incremental variance to SIA than did the other demographic variables. Overall, the theoretical model including age, length of time in the US, gender and school explained 36, 20, 15, and 41 percent of the variance in the SAI, SLA, SIA, and SBA respectively.

Design: A questionnaire consisting of the following sections was submitted to 900 workers in Southern Italy: for individual and cultural characteristics, coping strategies, personality behaviours, and acculturation strategies; for work characteristics, perceived job demands and job resources/rewards; for appraisals, perceived job stress/satisfaction and racial discrimination; for subjective reports of health, psychological disorders and general health. To test the reliability and construct validity of the extracted factors referred to all dimensions involved in the proposed model and logistic regression analyses to evaluate the main effects of the independent variables on the health outcomes were conducted. Results: Principal component analysis (PCA) yielded seven factors for individual and cultural characteristics (emotional/relational coping, objective coping, Type A behaviour, negative affectivity, social inhibition, affirmation/maintenance culture, and search identity/adoption of the host culture); three factors for work characteristics (work demands, intrinsic/extrinsic rewards, and work resources); three factors for appraisals (perceived job satisfaction, perceived job stress, perceived racial discrimination) and three factors for subjective reports of health (interpersonal disorders, anxious-depressive disorders, and general health). Logistic regression analyses showed main effects of specific individual and cultural differences, work characteristics and perceived job satisfaction/stress on the risk of suffering health problems. Conclusion: The suggested model provides a strong framework that illustrates how psychosocial and individual variables can influence occupational health in multi-cultural workplaces.

Aims: To investigate the correlation between acculturation and psychotic symptomatology in a group of immigrants suffering from psychosis and to explore differences in demographic factors related with the acculturation process between individuals with and without psychosis. Methods: Sixty-five patients and 317 non-psychotic immigrants were interviewed using the Immigrant Acculturation Scale (IAS) and a structured questionnaire for demographic data. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) and the GlÎ¿bal Assessment of Functioning (GAF) were also administered to all immigrants suffering from psychosis. Results: Total IAS scores, as well as IAS everyday life scores, were positively correlated with GAF scores. IAS everyday life score in the patient group related with religion, marital status, gender and years in Greece, while in the non-psychosis group it was related with gender and years in Greece. IAS wishful orientation/nostos (the strong desire for oneâ€™s homeland) related with religion in both groups. The IAS identity in the psychosis group did not show any significant relation with any of the variables, while in the non-patient group, it was related with marital status, gender and years in Greece. Age, duration of residence in Greece and higher adoption of Greek ethnic identity were the variables that differentiated the two groups of immigrants. Conclusion: Acculturation in immigrants suffering from psychosis could be seen as a process that does not correlate strongly with the severity of the symptomatology but is probably influenced by different set of factors.

Factors studied included perceived acculturation expectations of the members of the receiving society, values, cultural identities, general well-being, self-efficacy, cultural knowledge, social networks in the new home country, language proficiency, perceived cultural similarity, support for multicultural ideology and perceived discrimination in the country of origin. In line with the hypotheses, the respondents preferred integration over assimilation, separation and marginalisation strategies. Discriminant analysis was computed to distinguish integrationists, assimilationists and separationists, resulting in two functions that discriminated between the groups. The most important predictors explaining pre-migration acculturation attitudes were the perceptions potential migrants have of future hostsâ€™ preferences for immigrantsâ€™ cultural maintenance and contacts with hosts. In addition, general well-being, Russian identity and support for multicultural ideology significantly predicted acculturation attitudes in the pre-migration stage.

This study investigated the relationship between a range of independent variables such as, demographic factors, acculturation, acculturative stress, and resilience and the dependent variable that is the employment status of former refugees. Method Questionnaire data were gathered from 169 participants from the Ethiopian, Congolese, and Myanmar communities settled in Brisbane, Australia. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to investigate the factors that predicted employment status. Results Resilience and demographic variables such as age, education, gender, and country of origin were not associated with being employed. Length of stay and English proficiency increased the likelihood of being employed. Surprisingly, an increase in acculturation was associated with the likelihood of being unemployed, while an increase in acculturative stress was associated with the likelihood of being employed. Conclusions These findings indicate that unemployed participants perceived themselves to be acculturated and integrated, while those who were employed reported more acculturative stress. Furthermore, employment despite its positive impact can also be stressful. The study has practical and theoretical implications for stakeholders involved in the employment of refugees.

At present, Germany is close to the middle on the diversity and integration indexes, and below the middle on the policy index. Because of the recent arrival of around one million refugees from West Asia, Germany is an important country to examine and understand views about intercultural relations during this period of transition. The study in this chapter investigates intercultural relations in Germany with two samples from German participants and three other samples with diverse migration backgrounds. Furthermore, we examine how the feelings of well-being of migrants and the majority are related to their feelings of security and intergroup contact. The multiculturalism hypothesis proposes that confidence in one's own identity and place in society leads to the acceptance of culturally different others. In this study, we operationalize confidence in one's own identity and place in society as feeling secure in Germany. For the contact hypothesis, we assess the conditions under which contact is associated with higher levels of acceptance and positive out-group attitudes among minority members. We operationalize 'contact' through the degree of fulfillment of the need to feel connected to Germans. The integration hypothesis proposes that a double engagement with both the culture of origin and the majority society should positively affect the well-being of migrants. We empirically evaluate this hypothesis by assessing two outcomes in relation to the integration strategy: self-esteem and acculturation pursuit.

We investigate informational (analytical and exploratory), normative (heritage and host) and diffuse-avoidant identity styles as predictors of identity commitment and identity outcomes (self-esteem, self-concept clarity and ethno-cultural identity conflict). Two positive and two negative pathways to identity outcomes were identified, which were fully or partially mediated by identity commitment. Analytical informational style and normative orientation to the host society predicted stronger identity commitment, which, in turn, resulted in more positive identity outcomes. In contrast, diffuse-avoidant and exploratory informational styles exerted negative effects on identity outcomes via identity commitment. Furthermore, identity commitment buffered the negative impact of normative orientation to the country of origin on self-esteem.

Central American immigrants represent a population that is a part of the Latino/Hispanic Diaspora in the United States. By the year 2050 the United States population will experience a great change in the ethnic/racial demographics and most will be former minorities comprising over 45% racial minorities (U.S. Census, 2005). Thus, it becomes more important for counselor educators and other helping professionals to understand how to adequately assess the 'Latino' and be culturally sensitive --- especially since Central American immigrants come from diverse backgrounds, and although they may be labeled 'Hispanic', there is diversity within groups of ethnic minorities. This dissertation examined the research hypotheses: There is a relationship between acculturation level and PTSD among Central American immigrants in the United States. In addition, there are predictive relationships among the demographic variables. The null hypotheses presented are: There is no relationship between acculturation level and PTSD among Central American immigrants in the United States and additionally, there are no predictive relationships among the demographic variables. A Pearson correlation design was done to assess statistical significance (both positive and negative), and to examine if there was a relationship between acculturation level and PTSD. The alpha level was set at a significance level of .05. A standard Multiple Regression design was utilized to assess predictive relationships among the demographic variables with PTSD severity: migration reason, age, gender, migration year, and marital status. The sample of participants was n = 63 out of 100 participants who volunteered to participate in the study. The results show that there was a relationship between acculturation level and PTSD among Central American immigrants. Several instruments were utilized for this dissertation research to assess both acculturation level and prevalence or lack of PTSD severity. The AMAS-ZABB (Abbreviated Multidimensional Acculturation Scale) and the PCL-C (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Civilians) were utilized in this study. The results showed a positive correlation between acculturation level (U.S. identity, r = .289), Latino identity (r = .281), and PTSD. At an alpha level of alpha .01, age was positively correlated (r = .684) and acculturation level (English language) was negatively correlated with PTSD (r = -.465). Multiple R for regression was statistically significant when examining the demographic variables of age, acculturation level (English Language) and migration reason. The results were also statistically significant in predicting PTSD severity.

Among all newlyweds in the United States (U.S.) in 2010, 26% of Hispanics married out (Wang, 2012). Existing literature on society's attitudes towards assimilation and interracial marriage have changed since Latinos began immigrating to the U.S., resulting in positive changes in attitudes and an increase in interracial marriages (George & Yancey, 2003; Lee & Edmonston, 2005; Lee, 2008). There is a small amount of research that specifically focuses on attitudes toward interracial marriage among Latinos, and how acculturation may influence attitudes. The limited amount of research involving the Latino population does not specify the subgroups, or mostly focus on Mexican Americans, which is why this study examined attitudes among South Americans, the new wave of immigrants who have been understudied. The present study focused on providing an understanding on the influence of acculturation on attitudes toward interracial marriage among individuals who identified as Colombian, Ecuadorian, and Peruvian, due to having the highest rate of immigration to the United States (U.S. Census, 2010) among South American countries. Educational level, age, and generational status were also examined to determine their effects on attitudes.

Quantitative Results from this study showed that there was a significant interaction between generational status and attitudes toward interracial marriage. Education level and age were not correlated with attitudes toward interracial marriage, and the SASH and ATIDS were weakly correlated.

This information was obtained by a socio-demographic questionnaire, the Schedule of Racist Events Modified for Use with Arab American Persons (SRE-AA), the Perceived Religious Discrimination Scale (PRDS), the Vancouver Index of Acculturation- Modified Arab Version (VIA-A), the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure - Revised (MEIM-R), the Family Assessment Device General Functioning subscale (FAD-GF), and the Index of Religiosity (IR). Participants responded to three narrative items. Two VIA-A subscales measured level of acculturation and six variables were both taken together and used separately to measure perceived discrimination (PRDS subscales-Religious; SRE-AA subscales-Racial). Quantitative analysis found a positive association was demonstrated between VIA-A North American subscale scores and the combined subscales measuring perceived discrimination (SRE-AA, PRDS). Also perceived discrimination as measured by the SRE-AA In the Past Year subscale correlated with acculturation as measured by the VIA-A-North American subscale. A negative correlation was also found between VIA-A Cultural Heritage subscale and SRE-AA In U.S. However, none of the variables in H2 mediated these relationships. Gender and number of years spent in the Arab world ultimately did not significantly contribute to the model.

In addition to demographic variables, 5 standardized measures including the Vancouver Index of Acculturation, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD), Iowa Self-Assessment Inventory, Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale, and the Geriatric Scale of Recent Life Events were utilized in this study. The results showed that about 50% of participants reported a score of 16 and above on the CESD scale, indicating a presence of depressive symptoms. In addition, most participants identified with their heritage culture compared to the American culture. The results of multiple regression analysis revealed 4 significant predictors of depression: cognitive status (Î² = âˆ’.34, p < .01), heritage culture (Î² = .35, p < .01), physical health (Î² = âˆ’.27, p < .05), and internal health locus of control (Î² = âˆ’.25, p < .05).

As hypothesized, results supported indirect links between economic and cultural adaptation stressors and spousesâ€™ marital negativity and satisfaction: (1) contextual stress was associated with depressive symptoms, (2) depressive symptoms were positively associated with marital negativity for both husbands and wives and negatively associated with marital satisfaction for wives only, and (3) marital negativity was inversely associated with marital satisfaction for both spouses. Two partner effects emerged: (a) husbandsâ€™ depressive symptoms were positively associated with wivesâ€™ reports of marital negativity and (b) husbandsâ€™ marital negativity was inversely related to wivesâ€™ marital satisfaction. From these findings, we can infer that the psychological distress that arises for Mexican-origin spouses as they respond to the challenges of making ends meet during difficult economic times while they simultaneously navigate adapting to life in a new country is evidenced in their marital quality. Specifically, this study found that contextual stress external to the marital relationship was transmitted via spousesâ€™ psychological distress and negative marital exchanges to spousesâ€™ marital satisfaction. Wivesâ€™ marital satisfaction was shown to be uniquely vulnerable to their own and their husbandsâ€™ depressive symptoms and marital negativity.

This is particularly true regarding Korean immigrants, an Asian population that is currently immigrating to non-Asian countries in large numbers. Aims: This study investigated how degree of acculturation and adherence to Asian values correlate with psychological distress among Korean immigrants (N = 118) in the United States. Method: Participants from the Midwestern United States (N = 118) completed survey packets including a demographic questionnaire, the Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identity Acculturation Scale, the Asian Values Scale, and the Brief Symptom Inventory 18. Results: A multiple regression analysis revealed that less acculturation, stronger adherence to Asian values, and fewer years of living or being educated in the host country cumulatively predicted heightened psychological distress in this population.

Conclusion: Psychological distress among Korean immigrants living in a Western culture can be identified, and it is associated with a combination of lifestyle factors that impact mental health.

It is unclear whether this association is mediated through genetic, environmental or cultural factors individually or in combination. This pilot study aimed to explore this interaction by determining if acculturation in migrant groups contributed to the prevalence of ADIMD. Method: Culturally diverse but relatively genetically homogeneous (white Caucasian) patients with schizophrenia (n = 40) treated at a single site were assessed for the presence of ADIMD and level of acculturation. Results: Higher levels of acculturation correlated with an increased prevalence of TD and akathisia but not Parkinsonism. The level of acculturation significantly predicted TD.

One hundred and five forced and voluntary African migrants to New Zealand completed a questionnaire, which included two measures (a) the Psychological Motives to Migrate (Tharmaseelan, 2005) and (b) the Psychological Acculturation Index (Mace, 2004). Demographic information, including data on the New Zealand government immigration categories through which the migrant gained entry and length of time in New Zealand, was also collected. Multivariate analyses indicated that motivations to migrate do matter when it comes to acculturation preferences. Further, it was found that psychological motives to migrate were better predictors of acculturation preferences than the government immigration categories. Specifically, voluntary migrants (those motivated by â€˜family life improvementâ€™ and â€˜explorationâ€™) preferred to adapt to New Zealand culture, while forced migrants (those motivated by â€˜escapingâ€™) had a higher preference to maintain their culture of origin. Duration of time in New Zealand was correlated with acculturation preferences.

Acculturation has also been linked with stress-related psychological disorder and depression. Aims: This article investigates the acculturation process and the depressive state of foreign immigrants living in the greater Athens area. Methods: All consecutive cases of 157 foreign immigrants who visited a nongovernmental organization (NGO) providing consultative services to immigrants were interviewed using a structured questionnaire including the Immigrant Acculturation Scale (IAS) and the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies--Depression (CES-D) scale. Results: Factor analysis of IAS yielded a three-factor solution and 17 items with loadings ranging from 0.74 to 0.41. This scale was also tested and proven to be reliable. The main finding is that the higher the acculturation level of the immigrant individual, the lower the CES-D scale score; the fewer the depressive symptoms are self-reported. Length of stay, existence of family in Greece, legal status of residence and employment were also found to have an effect on depressive symptomatology. Conclusion: Acculturation could be seen as a beneficial mechanism protecting the individual to be exposed to stressful non-adaptive behaviour.

The dependent variable in this study was acculturative stress while the independent variables included measures of social capital described as constructs based on factor analysis and demographic variables. Five hypotheses were generated, and data was collected from 326 Iraqi Christians residing in Southern Ontario, Canada, who completed a set of questionnaires administrated by the researcher of this study. Three layers of analysis were implemented to test each hypothesis. The first layer tested the predictability of social-capital constructs and the demographic variables on the overall acculturative-stress score. Using logistic regression, an 'Acculturative Stress Main Model' was developed to test the predictability of the social-capital constructs and demographic variables on the overall acculturative-stress score. A binary score was created by splitting the sum of responses to all acculturative stress at the median score. The range of the acculturative-stress sum score was 1 to 100 with a median score of39. This means participants showed a moderate level of acculturative stress. The second layer of the analysis investigated the specific interrelationships between the independent variables and each individual construct of the acculturative stress instrument. This layer of the analysis provided a better understanding of the complex relationships between the dependent and independent variables. For this purpose, six logistic regression models were developed: (1) AS experiencing stereotypes, (2) AS change in values, (3) AS language competencies, (4) AS feeling unappreciated , (5) AS experiencing discrimination, (6) AS identification with country of origin. Each model tested an individual construct of acculturative stress as a dependent variable and against the independent variables of the study (age, education, gender, income, and the six social-capital constructs). A binary score was computed for each acculturative-stress construct, and the distribution was split at the median within each construct. The third layer evaluated each factor from the social-capital instrument and the demographic variables as predictors on the binary outcome for the individual construct of acculturative stress by splitting the sample according to gender to understand the source of stress for each gender. The results of this study in relation to the first, second, fourth, and, fifth hypotheses were consistent with existing social-capital literature on health, which considers social capital as resources that reduce psychological stressors and improve the health and well-being of individuals. In effect, because the participants of this study enjoy social capital, they do not experience high level of acculturative stress. The moderate level of acculturative stress they do experience is due to their interaction with people from the dominant culture. However, the results of this study in relation to the third hypothesis were inconsistent with previous literature. This is one of the few studies that introduces the concept of social capital to the field of social work, considering social capital as a source of social integration and as means of economic success. Social capital is also essential for policy development to support diversity inclusion and social cohesion in a multicultural society. This study connects the concept of social capital to the psychological health of immigrants by considering social capital as a predictive factor of acculturative stress. This investigation developed its acculturation model as involving three levels of interaction by the immigrant.

The proliferation of studies reflects the growing size and heterogeneity of Asian immigrant populations in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. This paper compares various approaches to acculturation within the health literature on Asian immigrants by reviewing the literature in three-health domains (1) mental health (2) physical health and (3) health services use. The review critically examines the conceptualizations and measures of acculturation in these three domains and presents major findings. We observe that measurement difficulties posed by the experiences of heterogeneous Asian groups compound theoretical and disciplinary disparities between acculturation instruments. The extent to which conceptual and methodological critiques of acculturation studies in Hispanic populations apply to studies of Asian populations is also discussed. The critical review thus provides insights into the diverse ways that the relationship between culture and health is measured in this complicated and growing literature.

Design/methodology/approach: The research employed a survey questionnaire applied to a sample of 210 migrants who had migrated from Sri Lanka to New Zealand. Twenty-three independent and three dependent (career successâ€”objective and subjective) variables were measured. Sequential multiple regression analysis was applied, mirroring the time-sequenced theory of career development. Findings: Overall, migrantsâ€™ occupational status had declined markedly following migration. Variables representing human capital, social integration and career self-management perspectives all contributed substantially to explaining variances in career success, especially objective career success, but motivation to migrate did not. Human capital variables were especially influential in determining pre-migration success, acculturation in the host country and education in the host country in post-migration success. Effects of career self-management behaviors on success were relatively small. Research limitations/implications: A limitation is the cross-sectional design, and possible non-generalisability beyond a single migrant group and host country. Practical implications: The paper discusses implications for migrants, policy makers and future research. Originality/value: Migration, and interest in research on migrantsâ€™ careers, is growing.

Adapting focused on coping with transitions, coping with memories of past and attendant losses, coping with accepting a new culture while trying to fit into the new culture, and learning the new language perfectly. Implicit in the refugees' experiences were states of culture shock, loneliness, psychic numbness, grief, nostalgia, and feelings of dejection, humiliation, inferiority, and feeling as if they belonged nowhere.

The participants completed a questionnaire including measures of sociocultural adaptation, psychological adaptation, social relationships, acculturation attitudes, and NCC. The results of a multivariate analysis of variance revealed main effects of acculturation strategies for both forms of adaptation and a main effect of NCC for psychological adaptation. The Croatian and Polish immigrants differed in the level of sociocultural adaptation but not in the level of psychological adaptation.

The first is Immersion within the Society of Origin (ISO), which has two facets: 'Orientation towards Members of the Ingroup' (OMI) and 'Orientation towards the culture of origin' (OCO). The second, 'Immersion within the Host Society' (IHS) also comprises two facets: 'Orientation towards People of French Origin' (OPFO) and 'Orientation towards French Culture' (OFC). The aim was to analyze the relationship between these four facets of sociocultural acculturative orientations and various socio-demographic and psychosocial variables. Two-hundred-and-ten North African immigrants in France answered a questionnaire adapted from Stephenson's Multi group Acculturation Scale (SMAS). Stepwise multiple regression analyses show that OMI is linked to the country of origin and cultural identity, and OCO to satisfaction with life, family situation, sex and cultural identity. OPFO is linked to participation in club activities, and OFC to work/student activity and family situation. These results illustrate the relevance and value of studying immigrants' sociocultural, acculturative orientation on the basis of ISO vs. IHS models, and in the fields of their social relations and their relationship with the culture. They highlight the importance of looking at acculturation as a composite process, the various facets of which are related to different variables that can therefore be regarded as relevant indicators of immigrants' intercultural adaptation.

Design/methodology/approach: The sample consisted of 141 host community (Dutch) and 41 non-western immigrant workers of a postal service company who filled out a questionnaire. Methods of analyses include analysis of variance and multiple regression. Findings: In line with the IAM, results showed that a higher disconcordance in preferred acculturation orientations between host community and immigrant workers related to a poorer quality of intergroup work-relations. However, intergroup contact moderated this relationship differently for host community and immigrant workers. Research limitations/implications: Data are cross-sectional and collected in one organization. Future studies should replicate the findings to other organizational contexts, cultural groups, and collect longitudinal data to determine causal effects. Practical implications: Organizations should monitor disconcordance in acculturation orientations amongst host community and immigrant workers. A multicultural culture in organizations may reduce disconcordance in acculturation orientations between host community and immigrant workers. Originality/value: The paper helps to explain the mixed findings in cultural diversity research so far, by demonstrating that disconcordance in acculturation orientations relates negatively to intergroup work-relations in a multicultural workplace.

The study aimed first to replicate the findings of previous investigations regarding the predictors of sociocultural adaptation at the whole sample level. The results showed that length of residence in the new culture, immigration status (having resident permits or being 'illegal'), and perceived discrimination were the most powerful predictors of sociocultural adjustment of immigrants. Education, relationships with host nationals and perceived cultural distance were other factors significantly associated with social difficulty in the receiving society. The second purpose of the study was to test the universality of these predictors taking into account the possibility of culture-context interaction. Length of residence, immigration status and perceived discrimination were found to be independent or semi-independent of the context and culture. On the other hand, other variables contributed the explanation of outcomes of adjustment of the ethnocultural groups in their specific context. As predicted, the groups varied in their degree of social difficulty: the Colombians and the immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest degree of self-reported difficulty, the Ecuadorians had a medium degree, and the Brazilians and the North Africans had the lowest.

Depending on immigrants' ethnicity and specific health issues, groups may demonstrate health advantages or disadvantages as they relocate to a new area and adopt new values and behaviors. Whether immigrants are viewed as groups or individuals in obtaining health care and participating in research, professionals can assess the community-wide acculturation experience as well as the individual experience. As a critical variable in many health research and practice settings, acculturation must be conceptualized in relation to the setting, purpose, and target population, and then measured with the most appropriate, valid, and reliable instrument possible.

Their tooth status and periodontal health were assessed. Participants tended to start flossing after settling in Hong Kong. Favourable oral health knowledge was found in more acculturated participants, as indicated by proficiency in local languages and immigration history. Engagement in social and/or religious activities and decent living condition provided by employers were associated with favourable oral health behaviours and/or better oral health.

The hypothesis was supported that a larger perceived cultural distance between mainstream and immigrant culture is associated with less psychological (homesickness and stress) and sociocultural (behavior with Russian students and behavior with co-nationals) adjustment. The statistical relations between perceived cultural distance, personality and sociocultural adjustment were much stronger for host domain behavior than for home domain behavior. Adjustment was higher for participants with more cultural empathy, openmindedness and flexibility. Adjustment showed statistically stronger associations with cultural distance than with acculturation orientations.

A total of 120 participants representing three different generational groups (1st, 1.5, 2nd) varying in age, socioeconomic status, and educational level were recruited from the local Korean immigrant population. Participants were seen individually in their homes and instructions and measures were given in the language of the subject's choice (Korean or English). Measures included the Korean Acculturation Scale (KAS), composed of 32-item Acculturation and 8-item Biculturality subscales, a 52-item Relational Family Values Q-Sort (RFVQ), and a 14-item demographic questionnaire. Results indicated that the Korean Acculturation Scale (KAS) had excellent internal consistency and test-retest reliability over a two-week interval. KAS Acculturation and Biculturality Subscale scores were generally found to relate in the expected direction to demographic variables. The RFVQ Q-factor analysis replicated the two-factor solution found by Sung and Wozniak (1999); and on the basis of patterns of factor loadings, three participant groups were identified. (a) Group 1 included those loading positively and significantly only on the Acculturated Korean Family Values factor; (b) Group 2 consisted of those loading positively and significantly on the Traditional Korean Family Values factor and variously on the Acculturated Korean Family Values factor; and (c) Group 3 was composed of those loading positively and significantly on the Acculturated Korean Family Values factor and negatively and significantly on the Traditional Korean Family Values factor. KAS Acculturation Subscale scores were highest for Group 3, followed in order by Groups 1 and 2. Although no statistically significant differences were found for Biculturality Subscale scores, there was a trend for Group 3 to be lowest in Biculturality.

We examined the association between pre-migration and post-migration potentially traumatic events and stressors and mental health, and assessed the moderating effect of post-migration stressors in humanitarian migrants in Australia. Methods: In this study, we used the first wave of data between 2013 and 2014 from the Building a New Life in Australia survey. The survey included 2399 migrants who had arrived in Australia holding a permanent humanitarian visa 3â€“6 months preceding the survey, with 77% and 23% of participants being granted visas through offshore and onshore humanitarian programmes, respectively. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was measured with the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder 8 items (PTSD-8) and severe mental illness was measured with the Kessler Screening Scale for Psychological Distress (K6). Pre-migration potentially traumatic events and post-migration stressors related to asylum process and resettlement were measured with a self-reported questionnaire. Findings: Of the 2399 participants, 762 (31%; 95% CI 29Â·4â€“33Â·2) had PTSD and 394 (16%; 95% CI 14Â·2â€“17Â·2) had severe mental illness. The mean number of pre-migration potentially traumatic events was 2Â·1 (SD 1Â·4). 64%, 59%, 49%, and 18% of participants reported poor social integration, economic problems, worrying about family or friends overseas, and loneliness as post-migration stressors. Pre-migration potentially traumatic events and post-migration stressors were positively associated with PTSD and severe mental illness. Factors significantly modifying the association between pre-migration potentially traumatic events and mental health after controlling for confounding factors were resettlement related stressors, including loneliness (odds ratio 1Â·17, 95% CI 1Â·05â€“1Â·28 for PTSD and 1Â·28, 1Â·16â€“1Â·41 for severe mental illness) and the number of social integration stressors (1Â·10, 1Â·05â€“1Â·16 for PTSD). Interpretation: Our data suggest that post-migration resettlement-related stressors were the most important correlates of mental health in humanitarian migrants, accounting for both direct and indirect associations. Targeting resettlement-related stressors through augmenting psychosocial care programmes and social integration would be a key approach to improve humanitarian migrants' mental health.

The healthy migrant hypothesis and the acculturation hypothesis, stating that the foreign-born and the less acculturated enjoy better health, have been proposed as possible complementary explanations. However, it is not clear which are the socioeconomic, cultural, and personal characteristics that favor good health and that differentiate foreign-born from US-born and unacculturated from acculturated Mexicans. In this paper, we compare, by nativity and acculturation level, the socioeconomic, cultural, and personal characteristics in a sample of low income mostly female Mexican-origin individuals living in Texas and investigate their contribution to differences in self-reported physical health, mental health, and self-rated health (SRH) status. Using a multistage probability sample, we completed 1745 interviews with Mexican-origin individuals. The survey instrument included the SF-12, demographic and socioeconomic information, and questions on social support, religiosity, fear of victimization, trust, perceived racism, and perceived opportunity. Nativity and use of the Spanish language were combined into a nativity/acculturation variable. We estimated multivariate regressions and ordered logit regressions to investigate the association of health outcomes to nativity/acculturation and socioeconomic, cultural, and personal characteristics. Overall, the distribution of strengths (more social support, trust, perceived personal opportunities and less perceived victimization) reflected a nativity-based income gradient and an education gradient reflecting language use. Health outcomes varied by nativity/acculturation after controlling for socioeconomic, cultural, and personal characteristics. Physical health differed by nativity, supporting the healthy migrant hypothesis, while nativity-based differences in mental health were explained by socioeconomic and personal characteristics. SRH varied by language use, suggesting a culturally conditioned response. The socioeconomic, cultural, and personal factors affected health outcomes differently. These findings suggest a complicated interaction between nativity, acculturation, and economic factors in determining social and personal strengths and their influences on health.

Theoretically, it sought to answers questions that help determine how Americanization---the adaptation and acculturation of a visiting culture to absorb and incorporate the host culture into their lives, customs, and social practices, and in this case savings behavior. A comprehensive model was developed to test the idea that living in America can and does have an influence on social and cultural practices. What was of interest in this study was whether or not these same influences could have an impact on particular cultural practices, in this case how people felt about, reacted to, and addressed the concept of savings--the stockpiling of funds for future needs. Information was gathered from a sample of over 500 Saudi Arabian students living in the United States. The model as structured was tested using SEM analytic techniques in an effort to fully explore and expose the nuanced and subtle differences among the respondents. The concept of savings behavior being influenced by Americanization as originally discussed was not substantiated by the model even though some of the indicators were within expected parameters (chi2 = 217.241, p < .001; CFI = 0.839, TLI = 0.732, RMSEA = 0.034). Despite the general problems the overall model revealed that at least 17% of what was termed as savings behavior could be explained by the model. The study still retained its value because it has made inroads into an area that has not yet been explored. Future investigations should take care to find better ways to incorporate some of the cultural elements of savings behavior directly into the instrument based on the perspective of their test populations rather than assume value in and use instruments tested and normed with US samples.

We evaluate whether factors related to the processes of acculturation and enculturation, immigration factors, family stressors and supports, contextual factors, and social status in the US account for differences in 12-month prevalence of psychiatric disorders for eight subgroups of Latinos. We report results that differentiate Latino respondents by country of origin and age at immigration (whether they were US-born or arrived before age 6: In-US-as-Child [IUSC]; or whether they arrived after age 6: later-arrival immigrants [LAI]). After age and gender adjustments, LAI Mexicans and IUSC Cubans reported a significantly lower prevalence of depressive disorders than IUSC Mexicans. Once we adjust for differences in family stressors, contextual factors and social status factors, these differences are no longer significant. The risk for anxiety disorders appears no different for LAI compared to IUSC Latinos, after age and gender adjustments. For substance use disorders, family factors do not offset the elevated risk of early exposure to neighborhood disadvantage, but coming to the US after age 25 does offset it. Family conflict and burden were consistently related to the risk of mood disorders. Our findings suggest that successful adaptation into the US is a multidimensional process that includes maintenance of family harmony, integration in advantageous US neighborhoods, and positive perceptions of social standing. Our results uncover that nativity may be a less important independent risk factor for current psychiatric morbidity than originally thought.

Method: One hundred and thirty five (135) respondents from Romania and Ecuador responded to a questionnaire analyzing mental health by means of the GHQ-12, coupled with other personal, social and psychosocial acculturation variables. Results: Both cultural groups differed significantly regarding the impact of personal and social variables on their well-being. Nevertheless, mental health distress was not explained by their cultural differences but by gender, gross income and perceived discrimination.

It investigated dimensions of immigrants' success and explored paths of success of immigrants from different countries of origin. Two main dimensions of immigrantsâ€™ success were outlined: economic success and psychological well-being, when the latter included 'sense of belonging' and 'life satisfaction'. An instrument measuring both dimensions of success was developed. The study was based on data from the 2011 Immigrant Survey completed by a representative sample of the immigrant population in Israel, including 2927 immigrants from the Former Soviet Union, Asia & Africa, Europe & America, and Ethiopia. Structural Equation Modeling were used to generate the model of immigrants' success. The main paths of success were outlined.

This is followed by the development and validation of a multidimensional measure of acculturation for Italian Canadians, one aspect of their ethnic change. Construct validation is based on confirmatory factor analyses of the multitrait-multimethod data. Once validated, the measure is used for an investigation of the relationships between acculturation and some aspects of gender-role perceptions of Italian Canadian spouses.

In addition to the nature of the relationships between the constructs, the ways in which they are experienced by adult English learners were also investigated. Three inventories were adapted for delivery via a multimedia website. The English Language Anxiety Scale (Pappamihiel, 1999) adapted from the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (Horwitz, Horwitz & Cope, 1986) was adapted for measuring anxiety. The Stephenson Multigroup Acculturation Scale (1999) was selected for measuring the degree of acculturation, and the Multidimensional Acculturative Stress Inventory (Rodriguez, Myers, Bingham Mira, Flores, & Garcia-Hernandez, 2002) was selected for measuring acculturative stress. From the ninety-five original surveys that were begun on the website, fifty-five cases were selected for analysis. Results showed no significant correlations between the major constructs; however, interesting correlations among various individual items in the scales existed. Additionally, combined with the analysis of six semi-structured interviews, results indicate that the concept of foreign language classroom anxiety should be moved beyond the perimeter of the classroom for the case of adult immigrants learning English in an English-speaking country. Results further indicate that language acquisition in the adopted country when accompanied by the regular processes of acculturation may produce higher levels of language anxiety, not only in the degree of anxiety but also in the proportion of students dealing with anxiety when speaking English. The construct of language acculturation anxiety is proposed to identify the combined effect of language anxiety, acculturation, and acculturative stress. Implications for the instruction of adult English students are made, as well as recommendations for future studies, including considerations when using a computer mediated delivery with this population.

This study examined tobacco use in association with health beliefs and acculturation status among a convenience sample (N=132) of Arab-Americans over age 18 residing in California. A cross-sectional descriptive correlational design was employed and data collection included the following instruments: the Health Belief Questionnaire; Acculturating Rating Scale for Arab-American-II; Tobacco Use Questionnaire; plus a brief demographic survey. An integrative model of the Health Belief Model and Berry's Acculturation Model guided this study. Results showed that despite the increase in subjects' general health concern, tobacco use was still high. Subjects reported that barriers surrounding tobacco cessation were greater than the benefits of quitting, and those with lower levels of acculturation had higher levels of tobacco use regardless of duration of residency. The data supported the hypothesis that culture plays an important role in smoking behavior and health motivation. The Arab culture emphasizes both fatalism and reliance on God's will, but disease prevention programs in the US emphasize the individual's role in health promotion. Thus, culturally-sensitive tobacco cessation programs should be tailored to meet the needs of this high risk population.

A concurrent mixed-method nested, quantitative dominant design was employed. A comparison between actual and perceived sibling acculturation discrepancy was also examined as well as differences between Vietnamese and Chinese young adults on the key study variables. Thematic analysis of the qualitative data was conducted to further shed light on the quantitative findings. Two samples were collected: the main data set comprised of 150 Vietnamese and Chinese young adults and the sibling pairs data set comprised of 18 pairs of siblings. Questionnaires on self-reported and perceived bilinear acculturation, sibling relationship quality, psychological adjustment, intercultural adjustment difficulties and demographic data were administered online. Qualitative data was collected using eight open-ended questions regarding sibling acculturation discrepancy and sibling relations. Quantitative results showed that sibling acculturation discrepancy uncorrelated with psychological adjustment or intercultural adjustment difficulties. Further, sibling conflict moderated the relationship between perceived sibling heritage acculturation discrepancy and intercultural competence difficulties and predicted psychological adjustment. Analyses also revealed that siblings accurately perceived acculturation discrepancies. Further, actual and perceived acculturation discrepancy were both associated with psychological adjustment and intercultural competence difficulties. Finally, Chinese young adults were more likely to report higher heritage acculturation and sibling warmth than Vietnamese young adults. Qualitative results revealed seven themes of which three were related to the quantitative results. First, siblings defined acculturation in both multi-factorial and bilinear terms. A multi-factorial and bilinear approach to acculturation measurement may have enhanced the present study. In addition, siblings were aware of differences in acculturation between themselves, but they employed many strategies to cope with perceived acculturation differences to help mitigate sibling conflict and distress. The association between sibling conflict and psychological adjustment found in this study may be related to the way siblings cope with acculturation differences. This study expands upon the acculturation gap-distress model to include siblings as an important context within which to study immigrant adjustment and adaptation.

These instruments were identified and selected on the basis of commonly-used measurement criteria and professionally recognized publication outlets and data bases. The constructs, measurement methodology, and instrument-development information in the two domains of acculturation and ethnic identity were described, reviewed, and evaluated, as these explain the adaptations of Latinos and Asian Americans to White American society and their attachments to their ethnic societies. Methodological questions related to the measurement of acculturation were raised and answered to evaluate its current state-of-the-art. Each of the 29 instruments was described in the text; their psychometric properties were presented in a table (Appendix A); and the effect sizes of significant results shown by instrument-development studies were tested. Two levels of expert raters quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated the psychometric properties of the acculturation (including acculturative stress) and ethnic identity instruments on an Instrument Evaluation Questionnaire developed for the study. The Instrument Evaluation Questionnaire showed high inter-rater reliability and acceptable internal consistency. On the basis of expert ratings, the instruments were ranked and the acceptability of reliability and validity evidence was noted. Qualitative themes were developed from the experts' stated rationales for their evaluations, with the themes providing clarification to the quantitative results. Additionally, effect sizes of group differences indicated by the instrument-development studies were shown to be moderate to high. In keeping with the utilitarian nature of the study, important correlations of acculturation (including acculturative stress) and ethnic identity instruments with immigrant sociocultural variables were summarized. These correlations were judged to be of moderate to high effect size. Finally, theoretical and measurement implications with respect to the findings for the instruments were explained. While the overall rankings of the instruments' psychometric properties indicated that some were more soundly constructed than others, the separate reliability and validity ratings showed that the majority of instruments were good to very good in establishing appropriate psychometric evidence.

This project was an effort to expand our understanding of the impact of acculturation in the workplace and on workplace practices, particularly on the rapidly growing number of diversity programs. A sample of 150 Armenian immigrants (8 Assimilated, 32 Separated, and 109 Bicultural Armenians) living in the United States of America participated in this study. The participants completed a series of questionnaires including: (1) a reward allocation questionnaire which measured reward distribution preferences, (2) the Pan-Acculturation Scale (Soriano, 1999) which identified participants' acculturation type, (3) the Values Scale (Singelis et al., 1995) which assessed the participants' cultural patterns in terms of vertical and horizontal individualism and collectivism, (4) the Group Characteristics Questionnaire (Ferdman & Horenczyk, 2000) which determined the strength of ethnic identity with respect to the Armenian and American cultures, and (5) a demographic questionnaire. The hypotheses concerning participants' choice of equity-based or equality-based allocation style varying based on acculturation type was not supported. Essentially, Assimilated, Separated, and Bicultural Armenian immigrants did not demonstrate a significant difference in preferences for reward allocations. The hypotheses concerning the interaction between type of acculturation and workgroup ethnic composition in preferences for reward allocations was also not supported in that Bicultural Armenian immigrants did not differ in their reward allocation preferences based on the workgroup ethnic composition. An unexpected finding in the data set was that Separated and Bicultural respondents preferred the Horizontal Individualism (HI) cultural pattern whereas the Assimilated respondents preferred the Horizontal Collectivism (HC) cultural pattern. The results of this empirical research show preliminary evidence of within-group differences among Armenian immigrants. The results demonstrated that the Vertical Individualism cultural value is significantly related to preferences for equity over equality (r = .31, p < .000). This is an important contribution to cross-cultural psychological literature in that it establishes a connection between cultural values and preferences in reward allocations. In addition, this finding is an important one for employers to take note of. In order to maximize motivating factors, employers must ensure that the rewards will lead to the desired results. To this end, employers must be open to researching and identifying what motivates their employees by diversifying the types of rewards and the manners in which they are distributed.

The migrant pathway from Australasia to the UK is well established. Moreover, rugby league is a sport in which debate concerning the merits of employing labour migrants from Australasia is prevalent and ongoing. The study used interview and questionnaire data to investigate the embodied experiences facing this group of migrant professionals. Migrant experiences prior to migrating were contoured by access to resources and by the formal and informal relationships developed through professional and personal careers. The embodied and complex nature of contractual negotiations is highlighted. The centrality of embodied migrant identity and habitus is noted in relation to acculturation strategies adopted over time and space, both prior to and during a foreign sojourn, in terms of established and outsider groups. The paper also highlights how subgroups within a more general group of labour migrants can emerge. Furthermore, the complex influence of personal and professional relationships was found to be both enabling and constraining. These differences between subgroups are considered in light of previous work on acculturation strategies and the existential nature of migration.

The paper begins by describing the current cultural and immigrant diversity in Russia, and then provides a short description of Russian immigrants and the social and psychological problems that immigrants and the larger society face. We present the conceptual framework and findings from empirical studies that examine the reciprocal acculturation and intercultural relations between migrants and members of the larger society. We analyze these studies with respect to their relevance to three hypotheses that have been advanced for examining intercultural relations: the multiculturalism hypothesis; the integration hypothesis; and contact hypothesis. Findings of the studies showed that measures of security, identity, perceived threat/discrimination have a significant relationship with ethnic tolerance, mutual attitudes, acculturation strategies and expectations, and the well-being and life satisfaction of both immigrants and members of the larger society. The results of these studies support all three hypotheses in both groups. The authors concluded that the efforts to improve relations between members of the larger society and immigrants should be directed at enhancing the basic sense of security and at developing programs that increase multicultural attitudes, ethno-cultural competence, and tolerance between both groups.

The survey design was cross-sectional and involved the administration of a questionnaire to a convenience sample of 600 healthy, free-living immigrants from China, ranging from 25 to 70 years of age (231 males and 357 females) representing diverse backgrounds. The questionnaire measured demographic factors, food preferences, and 13 social psychological scales derived from the Theory of Planned Behavior, the Health Belief Model, and Social Cognitive Theory. The content of the questionnaire was made culturally appropriate through a prior detailed qualitative interview study. The dependent measures assessed were intention to reduce dietary fat, behaviors related to the selection of reduced-fat diets, and consumption of high-fat foods. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine the association of the social psychological factors with the dependent outcomes. Attitude, overall health concern, and self-efficacy accounted for 58% of the variance in behavioral intention. In the prediction of fat-related dietary behaviors for the entire sample, a total of between 10% and 24% of the variance was explained by psychosocial and demographic factors. In general, a gradient was seen in the increased predictiveness of each regression model by degree of acculturation of the immigrants to American culture, with the more acculturated groups exhibiting the highest predictive values (R2 values between 12% and 67%). Pearson correlations indicated that acculturation was significantly related to declines in the influence of habit and of social norms. T-tests revealed that females and older subjects possessed more positive attitudes and intentions toward reducing dietary fat than that of males and younger subjects. The application of the theoretical frameworks to a Chinese population was useful for eliciting information about the relationships between health beliefs and the adoption of fat-related dietary behaviors. Future studies need to explore in greater detail the potential effects of acculturation on the social, cognitive, and behavioral aspects of Chinese individuals living in America.

A sample of 297 first generation immigrants was obtained, who were presented with Bartholomew's Relationship Scale Questionnaire (RSQ), the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and the Indonesian Acculturation Rating Scales (IARS), an Indonesian adaptation of the scales used by Cuellar and colleagues to research the acculturation patterns of Mexican-Americans. As hypothesized, secure persons generally demonstrated higher levels of adjustment as indicated by scores on the SCL-90 and the SWLS. Specifically, compared to persons whose attachment style categorizes them as secure, fearful and preoccupied persons reported higher indications of hostility, interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety, depression, and psychosomaticism, and lower levels of satisfaction with life. Compared to dismissive-avoidant persons, fearful and preoccupied persons reported only higher hostility and interpersonal sensitivity. No significant differences were found between secure and dismissive persons or between preoccupied and fearful persons. In exploratory analyses, the results show that the acculturative behavior pattern of immigrants parallels prototypical adult or even infant attachment relationships. In the context of cultural change, compared to those with other styles, persons with secure attachment are the most successful at adapting to acculturative stressors and integrating their own culture with another. Preoccupied persons generally fell between the two extremes of dismissively and securely attached people, with secure persons being more acculturated and oriented toward American culture. Unexpectedly, no significant differences were found between fearful and all styles combined. In terms of marginality, the acculturation attitude patterns follow Bartholomew's four-category typology. Securely attached persons have less difficulty relating to both their own and other cultures. Preoccupied persons tend to have less difficulty relating to their own culture, but are marginalized toward other culture. Dismissively attached people tend to have difficulty relating to own culture but not to other cultures. Fearfully attached persons reported difficulties relating to all cultures. Stress and satisfaction with life both mediated significantly the relationship between preoccupied and marginality, but not with other attachment styles. Findings are discussed in terms of attachment working models, and implications for future research and ministry to this immigrant population are explored.

Although bivariate analyses suggested that many predictors were associated with depressive symptoms, multivariate path analysis revealed a more complex structure of mediated associations. In the multivariate path analysis only reports of physical health and immigrant stress were directly related to depressive symptoms (P < 0.05), while acculturation, time in the US, income, US citizenship, and distance of persons on whom one could rely were related to stress (but not to physical health status) and only to depressive symptoms as mediated by stress.

These hypotheses were derived from the Canadian multiculturalism policy (Berry, 1984), and their validity has been assessed in a number of countries. Our goal was to evaluate these hypotheses in Russia (Moscow) and Latvia (Riga). We used sociopsychological surveys of two dominant groups (Russian Muscovites and Latvians in Riga) and two nondominant groups (migrants from the Caucasus in Moscow and the Russian minority in Riga) employing structural equation modeling. A sense of perceived security promoted tolerance toward other cultural groups in three of the samples. Perceived security was related significantly to multicultural ideology in Riga, but there was no significant relationship to multicultural ideology in the Moscow samples. A preference for the integration strategy among the migrants in Moscow as well as among the Russians in Latvia promoted their better sociocultural adaptation and had a significant impact on the life satisfaction of the Muscovites but had no impact on the Latvian sample in Riga. Our results provided some support for the effect of intercultural contact on the acceptance of others in three of the groups: the migrants in Moscow, the Russian minority in Riga, and the dominant group in Moscow. However, among the Russians in Riga, the relationship between contacts and perceived security was negative. The multiculturalism hypothesis was confirmed with the dominant group in Riga and was partly confirmed with both the dominant and the nondominant groups in Moscow and with the Russian minority in Riga. The contact hypothesis received partial support with both groups in Moscow and the Russian minority in Riga but was not confirmed with the Latvians in Riga. There was partial support for the role of the integration strategy in promoting sociocultural adaptation and well-being among the migrants in Moscow and the Muscovites. These findings require additional analysis of the sociopolitical and historical context in Latvia in order to understand the psychological outcomes of acculturation among the Russian minority there.

Results: The results indicate that mental ill health among immigrants is independently associated with non-immigrant-specific factors (i.e. high number of types of traumatic episodes, divorced/widowed, poor social network, economic insecurity and being female) and immigrant-specific factors (i.e. low level of sociocultural adaptation). These results were obtained regardless of whether mental ill health was operationalized as low subjective well-being or a high symptom level of anxiety/depression. Conclusions: These findings support the notion that mental ill health among immigrants is a multi-faceted phenomenon that needs to be tackled within a wide range of sectorsâ€”e.g. the healthcare system, the social service sector and, of course, the political arena.

It is motivated by the conundrum between these migrants' high pre-migration human capital and their lower-than-expected post-migration socioeconomic status in the U.S. Angled at the intersection of race and migration, this research is informed by four major bodies of theoryâ€”international migration theory, theories on racial hierarchy and race relations, contemporary assimilation theory, and social network theory. This research has a two-fold agenda: (1) to uncover how race/ethnicity and social class accommodate or obstruct the migration and assimilation of African immigrants and (2) to clarify how social networks in various contexts facilitate or constrain the assimilation of African-horn migrants in the U.S. This research employs an extended case method approach which is suitable for research that aims to reconstruct existing theory. The instruments include a survey on background information, in-depth interviews on migration history and adaptation process, survey instruments for network analysis, and 'shadowing' observations with Ghanaian and Nigerian immigrants residing in Maryland. A snowball sampling technique was used to recruit participants that vary by individual and contextual characteristics through school, work, and neighborhood-based associations, voluntary organizations, and field contacts. I find that Ghanaians and Nigerians migrate to the United States in pursuit of educational and occupational opportunity in a politically stable society. They use their human-cultural, social, and financial capital to acquire a vast array of visas in pursuit of the American Dream. However, their ability to successfully integrate into American society is circumscribed by their immigration status, race, gender, and class backgrounds as illustrated by their migration processes, educational experiences, workforce trajectories, and social integration patterns in the United States. While I st generation immigrants exhibit varying degrees of success, their determination and selective acculturation strategiesâ€”mainstream economic integration coupled with selective cultural assimilationâ€”pave the way for subsequent cohorts and generations of Ghanaian and Nigerian immigrants to enjoy upward mobility in American society. These findings establish assimilation as a multigenerational process circumscribed by societal structure but also negotiated through immigrant agency.

It is presented as a six-stage progression model with universal application. Experiments using Rest's Defining Issues Test (DIT) that measures stages in the model have not shown subjects coming from non-western cultures as scoring as high as subjects from western cultures, especially at the model's 'postconventional' level (stages five and six). This study assessed the level of acculturation of minority, college (or equivalent) educated immigrants from non-western cultures, now living in the USA, to determine the relationship between their levels of acculturation and the principled moral reasoning they manifest. The study hypothesized that immigrants with higher scores on the dominant society immersion scale were likely to produce higher levels of principled moral reasoning as defined by the Defining Issues Test and also, that conversely, immigrants with higher scores on the ethnic society immersion scale were likely to obtain lower levels of principled moral reasoning. Two psychological questionnaires were administered. The Stephenson Multigroup Acculturation Scale (SMAS) measured levels of acculturation. The SMAS provided two scores, namely, dominant society immersion score, and ethnic society immersion score. The Defining Issues Test determined the postconventional principled moral reasoning currently held by the subjects (expressed as their P scores). The analysis resulted in a significant positive correlation between the P score and the dominant society immersion. This shows that those with higher levels of principled moral reasoning are likely to get higher scores on the dominant society immersion scale. Conversely, those with higher levels of principled moral reasoning were more likely to obtain lower scores on the ethnic society immersion scale. The finding brings into question the concept of universality in Kohlberg's theory of moral development.

More sophisticated and comprehensive research designs have been sought to illuminate the complexity of the relationship. In response, the present study attempted to examine the relationship between acculturation/enculturation and subjective well-being (SWB) by including social connectedness and its importance as a mediator and a moderator, respectively. One hundred eighty-eight Korean immigrants residing in two Midwestern metropolitan areas participated in this study. A survey questionnaire method was used for data collection. Structural equation modeling and hierarchical multiple regression analysis were used for mediation and moderation tests, respectively. The influence of acculturation was found to be partially mediated to SWB via social connectedness both in mainstream society and in the ethnic community. The influence of enculturation was found to be fully mediated to SWB via social connectedness in the ethnic community. In support of SWB theories of goal approaches and value-as-a moderator model, importance of social connectedness in mainstream society was found to moderate the relationship between social connectedness in mainstream society and positive affect. Importance of social connectedness in the ethnic community also was found to moderate the relationship between social connectedness in the ethnic community and positive affect.

In recent years, international humanitarian resettlement programs have increased the numbers of Africans entering third country resettlement programs; however, very little has been written about the experiences of African adults in resettlement as compared to other refugee groups. The current study used quantitative and qualitative methods to enhance understanding of the refugee experience among a specific group of refugees, adults from Sudan resettled in Brisbane, Australia. Ninety Sudanese adults (Mean age = 34.19) participated in the quantitative study, with 10 participants from that group purposefully selected to complete the semi-structured qualitative interview. Participants represented 20 different ethnic groups and reported disparate backgrounds and experiences both in Sudan and Australia, highlighting the incredibly heterogeneity of the Sudanese community. Quantitative participants reported an average 5.54 traumatic experiences on the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) and approximately one-quarter of the sample meeting recommended cut-off criteria for significant psychological distress on the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist (HSCL) and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on the HTQ. Individuals with higher rates of prior trauma, younger adults, and people who had spent time in a refugee camp reported higher levels of psychological distress. These groups also reported higher frequencies of discrimination, with one-third of the sample reporting experiences of discrimination several times per month. During data collection in 2007, there was significant public debate regarding the integration of the Sudanese community, mirroring debates worldwide as nations struggle with public discourse surrounding changes in global migration. In the current sample, the majority of participants (54.4%) reported integration as their method of acculturation, with individuals who had been in Australia longer, having higher levels of education and greater social connectivity within both the Sudanese and Australian communities being more likely to endorse integration. The ten qualitative participants emphasized opportunities for advancement such as through education and employment opportunities as a highlight and experiences of discrimination as a low point in resettlement, suggesting the importance of social context and opportunities for advancement in resettlement.

Method: We used Smithâ€™s (2003) theory of religious effects and Baron and Kennyâ€™s (1986) approach for mediation analysis to explain the mediating role of social support between DSE and depression. The sample consisted of 200 elderly Korean immigrants who were aged 65 or older (mean age = 72.5, range = 65â€“89) living in the New York City Metropolitan area. Hierarchical regression model was used with SPSS version 17.0 to analyze cross-sectional data. Results: Elderly Korean immigrants in the present sample were found to be moderately engaged in DSE but not experiencing a fair level of social support. Respondents reported no depression on the average but 30% of them (60 out of 200 respondents) were experiencing mild to severe depression. Both DSE and social support were inversely related with depression, and the relationship between DSE and depression was mediated by social support. Conclusion: These findings are only suggestive and should not be generalized to a larger population. However, this study supports the importance of DSE and social support in the life of elderly Korean immigrants as a way to alleviate depression.

The control strategies are action orientation and state orientation (AO-SO: Kuhl, 1994b), and primary control and secondary control (PC-SC: Rothbaum, Weisz, & Snyder, 1982; Weisz, Rothbaum, and Blackburn, 1984). The theories underlying these control strategies evolved from Western perspectives and explain intention and goal-directed human behavior. AO concerns the ease of carrying out intentions (i.e., high action control [AC]) whereas SO concerns the difficulty of carrying out intentions (i.e., low AC, which has state-oriented characteristics of preoccupation, hesitation, and volatility; Kuhl, 1994b). According to initial PC-SC theory, PC concerns the ways that humans directly effect social and physical change; in contrast, SC concerns human accommodation to the environment (Rothbaum et al., 1982). A theory addition was that Westerners exert more PC than Asians whereas Asians exert more SC than Westerners (Weisz et al., 1984). Previous AO-SO research did not study Asian or Asian American populations. Almost all prior experimental PC-SC research was conducted on Western samples. In the present study, East-West differences are approximated in the acculturation process. Chinese American participants (N = 228) were shown to vary by acculturation level (measured by degree of Chinese culturality and American culturality), as well as by generation level (n1 = 98, n2 = 102, n3+4 = 28). Pearson correlational analyses, controlling for years in the U.S. and annual income level, suggested that: (a) Chinese culturality is positively associated with AC and SC (both at home and at work); (b) American culturality is positively associated with PC (both at home and at work); (c) decision-related AC, an AC subconstruct, is associated with PC; and (d) failure-related AC, another AC subconstruct, is associated with SC. MANOVA results suggested that immigrant participants have the highest AC and PC score means. Cultural differences related to intention, action, and control or the fear of loss of face (Huang, 1991; Shon & Ja, 1982; Uba, 1994) may account for the findings. This research adds to the sparse literature on the psychology of Chinese Americans, provides a new understanding of the relationships between acculturation and control strategies, and offers new and improved instruments for assessing acculturation and behavior in Chinese Americans.

The findings reveal a gap between these individualsâ€™ changing sexual behaviours and the continuing silence on sex.

In addition, it also examined the relationship between demographic factors and adjustment and compared the predictive value of attachment styles and demographic factors for immigrants' adjustment. The Attachment Style Questionnaire was used to assess respondents' attachment. Psychological adjustment was measured with the Psychological Health Scale and the Satisfaction With Life Scale. Sociocultural adjustment was measured with the Social Support Listâ€”Interactions scale. Two scales for measuring identification and contact with the native and with the Dutch culture were developed and used as indicators of cultural adjustment. We found relations between attachment styles and psychological and sociocultural adjustment. Secure attachment was positively related (p < .01) to psychological and sociocultural adjustment, fearful attachment was negatively (p < .01) associated with psychological adjustment, and more negatively with identification with the Dutch culture than with identification with the native culture. Preoccupied attachment was negatively related (p < .01) to psychological adjustment and to identification with the Dutch culture. Dismissing attachment was weakly negatively related (p < .01) to sociocultural adjustment. Correlation patterns across the three immigrants' samples indicate that dismissing individuals remain relatively indifferent towards their native and the Dutch culture. Regarding demographic factors we found that education and age at immigration were positively associated with psychological and sociocultural adjustment, and length of residence appeared to be positively related to sociocultural adjustment. In general, demographic factors showed a stronger association with sociocultural than with psychological adjustment. Regression analysis revealed that attachment styles were better predictors of immigrants' psychological and sociocultural adjustment than demographic factorsâ€”education, age at immigration, and length of residence. The results indicate that immigrant studies would benefit from taking an attachment perspective.

Findings indicate that Ss in this sample did not want to be identified as different by either Americans or Indians. There was some evidence of isolation and a minor incidence of passive deviant behavior. These results suggest that recently arrived professional Indian immigrants may be seen as intellectuals who derive personal satisfaction within the boundaries of their primary group networks, have generally been accepted by the American communities, and are in the stage of accommodation/cultural assimilation.

Immigrants represent an interesting case for rejection-identification because (a) they can face rejection from both members of the majority group in the host country (e.g., Americans) and their ethnic community (e.g., Mexicans) specifically because of the membership in the other and (b) their ethnic and national identities are tied to different contexts and carry different levels of investment. In a survey of Latino immigrants in the United States, it was found that perceived group-based rejection from Latinos was related to lower ethnic identification and stronger identification with the United States and marginally stronger bicultural identification as Latino-American. Perceived group-based rejection from other Americans was related to stronger disidentification with the United States, but had no relationship to ethnic identification. These effects were independent of feelings of personal acceptance. The application of the rejection-identification model to the case of immigration is discussed.

In addition, studies have shown that acculturation may increase levels of perceived discrimination among foreign-born Mexicans living in the U.S. The primary purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between perceived racism and ambulatory blood pressure among a convenience sample of 332 foreign-born Mexicans living in Utah County, Utah controlling for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and acculturation. This was done through the use of several multiple regression analyses using archival data collected at Brigham Young University. The Perceived Ethnic Discrimination Questionnaireâ€”Community Version (Brief PEDQâ€”CV) was used to measure perceived racism. The Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans (ARSMA-II) was used to measure both language and general acculturation. Four blood pressure variables, including waking systolic blood pressure (WSBP), waking diastolic blood pressure (WDBP), sleeping systolic blood pressure (SSBP), and sleeping diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) were used as outcome variables in the regression analyses. A relationship between perceived racism and any of the ambulatory blood pressure variables used in this study was not found. In addition, English-language acculturation was not found to moderate the relationship between perceived racism and blood pressure in the sample of first generation Mexicans participating in this study. A moderating effect of general acculturation on the relationship between perceived racism and blood pressure was found when controlling for age, BMI, and gender, though this moderating effect disappeared when WDBP was included in the regression model.

The authors wish the following correction to be made in relation to Appendix 2. In the last box (score 5 in the social activities dimension) the text should read: Mrs Khanum is known to have mild diabetes. Nevertheless, she is very pleased with her life situation and satisfied with her personal life. She feels that so far, she has lived the kind of life she wanted to. She is eager to tackle her daily tasks and has no trouble making new decisions or coping with problems in her life. She feels that her life is full of interesting things. A full version of the questionnaire is available from the authors.] Questionnaires that measure subjective health status are increasingly used in clinical trials. But scales based on the quantification of subjective traits ('rate your feelings on a scale of 1 to 5') and initially developed in western population samples may not be valid for use in minority ethnic groups, even if accurately translated. The measurement of cultural adaptation and assimilation in immigrant groups is important for health research but has well documented methodological challenges. The aim of this study was to develop valid and reliable questionnaires to measure subjective health status and cultural adherence in a minority ethnic group, using the story as the unit of inquiry. The design was a multi-phase study involving (a) narrative interview, (b) vignette construction, (c) questionnaire development, and (d) questionnaire validation in relation to two scales (well-being and cultural adherence) in British Bangladeshis with diabetes. Using data from in-depth narrative interviews (i.e., a non-directive research technique in which the participant is invited to 'tell me the story about your diabetes, starting with when you first noticed anything wrong', and the only prompts used are 'tell me more about that' or 'what happened next?'; Greenhalgh, Helman, & Chowdhury, 1998; Muller, 1999), we constructed culturally congruent vignettes to depict different subjective health states and behaviours. We refined these items in focus group interviews and validated the instruments on 98 Bangladeshi participants, randomly sampled from GP diabetes registers in inner London and interviewed by a Bangladeshi anthropologist. We used factor analysis to explore the underlying structure in the responses to questionnaire items, plus Cronbach alpha tests to measure internal consistency of scales. The questionnaires were acceptable and credible to Bangladeshi participants with diabetes. Ninety of 98 participants were able and willing to complete them with interviewer assistance. Following factor analysis, we produced two definitive instruments. The well-being scale was a single-factor model with four story-based items (measuring depression, anxiety, physical energy, and social activities), with a Cronbach's alpha of .92. The cultural adherence scale was a single-factor model with five items (measuring religious restrictions, ethnic practices, and social ties), with a Cronbach's alpha of .83. In conclusion, this study has produced two important outputs: (a) easy-to-administer, story-based questionnaires that measure well-being and cultural adherence, which are specific to British Bangladeshis with diabetes; (b) a general method for developing story-based instruments to quantify the subjective experience of illness and adherence to cultural norms, which potentially has applications beyond the study population.

Females were more prone to eating concerns and these were positively related to symptoms of psychological distress. Acculturation, self-construal, ethnic identity and psychological functioning were not related to desire to be thinner, feeling guilt after eating, fear of being overweight nor preoccupation with the thought of having fat on one's body. Collective self-esteem and symptoms of psychological distress were positively related to feeling discomfort after eating sweets, while interdependent self-construal and assimilation were negatively related. Culturally relevant variables, namely acculturation, self-construal and ethnic identity, were related to only certain facets of eating concerns.

Method: A two-part research strategy using both quantitative and qualitative methods was employed. In the cross-sectional quantitative survey, 113 Chinese respondents completed a questionnaire investigating demographic factors, life experiences associated with migration, proficiency in the English language and mental health status. In the qualitative phase of the research, interviews were conducted with a further 24 immigrants to explore these factors in more depth. Results: In the questionnaire survey, over 60% of the group reported symptoms of poor mental health. Qualitative research shows that for those who were employed in catering, psychological adjustment was heavily dependent on strong ties with the Chinese community and there was minimal contact with the host society. By contrast, those concerned with professional development experienced conflict as a result of a high perceived need for integration and a recognition of the problems associated with this.

According to the assimilation hypothesis, Turkish immigrants to the U.S. should become more individualistic with increasing length of stay. Alternatively, the immigrant interdependence hypothesis proposes that the exigencies of immigration require retaining or increasing collectivist values and behaviors, especially the willingness to rely on others. Measures of individualism and collectivism were obtained from Turkish immigrants to the U.S., Turks residing in Istanbul, and residents of Boston. Bostonians and Istanbul residents differed primarily on vertical collectivism, which is the tendency to subordinate ones own goals to those of in-group authority figures. Immigrantsâ€™ values did not change with increasing length of stay in the U.S., refuting the assimilation hypothesis. When immigrants were compared to non-immigrants, immigrants endorsed stronger horizontal and vertical collectivism and more desire to both give and receive, consistent with the immigrant interdependence hypothesis. However, this hypothesis was not uniformly supported. Compared to non-immigrants, immigrants reported more self-reliance with competition, and more internal locus of control, indicating a sense of agency and responsibility.

Therefore, the present quantitative study investigated the variance in attitudes toward seeking psychological help as predicted by degree of acculturation, severity of self-reported problems, and beliefs about the cause of mental health problems among West African immigrants in the U.S. The following research questions and hypothesis were addressed: What are the specific mental and physical health concerns of West African immigrants in the U.S.? Where do West African immigrants with mental health problems seek help? The hypothesis was that higher acculturation into the U.S. society, severity of self-reported problems, and interactional attribution beliefs about mental health problems would be significant predictors of attitudes toward seeking psychological help. Approximately 600 questionnaires were mailed to first generation West African immigrants. A total of 126 surveys were received representing a return rate of 21%. Of this number 15 were not usable. Analyses were based on the remaining 111 surveys. Each survey packet included a demographic questionnaire, a referral list for national mental health, counseling and crisis services, a business reply envelope, and a battery of 4 instruments including the Attitude Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help Scale (ATSPPH), Behavioral Acculturation Scale (BAS), Brief Symptoms Inventory (BSI), and the Mental Health Locus of Origin Scale (MHLO). Descriptive statistics were computed (percentages & frequencies) to answer the first and second research questions. In addition, one multiple regression, using forced entry method was performed to predict West African immigrantsâ€˜ attitudes toward seeking psychological help as measured by the total scores on the ATSPPH, using the BAS, BSI, and MHLO scores as predictors. Finally, Pearson product moment correlation analyses were performed among the variables in examining the regression results. The results identified interactional attribution beliefs about mental health problems as the only significant predictor.

Factors such as cultural knowledge, length of stay in the new culture, and linguistic competence strongly influence this process. Length of stay and linguistic competence may be essential for cultural knowledge acquisition that, in turn, may be enhanced by mass media consumption. A questionnaire is completed by 576 immigrants (196 Romanians, 179 North Africans, and 201 Latino Americans) investigating time spent in Italy, proficiency in the Italian language, familiarity with Italian and homeland mass media, and acculturation. The authors hypothesize that language plays a central role in the acculturation process and assume that length of stay influences acculturation mostly through linguistic competence and mass media knowledge. A structural equation model is tested to verify the hypothesis. The model results are acceptable, invariant across genders, and partially invariant across ethno-cultural groups.

The present study examined the sociocultural adjustment of sojourning Malaysian students in Britain. Eighty-one Malay and 110 Chinese students enrolled in various courses answered a self-report questionnaire that examined various aspects of sociocultural adjustment. A series of one-way analyses of variance showed that Malay participants experienced poorer sociocultural adjustment in comparison with their Chinese counterparts. They were also less likely than Chinese students to have contact with co-nationals and host nationals, more likely to perceive their actual experience in Britain as worse than they had expected, and more likely to perceive greater cultural distance and greater discrimination. The results of regression analyses showed that, for Malay participants, perceived discrimination accounted for the greatest proportion of variance in sociocultural adjustment (73%), followed by English language proficiency (10%) and contact with host nationals (4%). For Chinese participants, English language proficiency was the strongest predictor of sociocultural adjustment (54%), followed by expectations of life in Britain (18%) and contact with host nationals (3%). By contrast, participants' sex, age, and length of residence failed to emerge as significant predictors for either ethnic group. Possible explanations for this pattern of findings are discussed, including the effects of Islamophobia on Malay-Muslims in Britain, possible socioeconomic differences between Malay and Chinese students, and personality differences between the two ethnic groups. The results are further discussed in relation to practical steps that can be taken to improve the sociocultural adjustment of sojourning students in Britain.

As an extension of research from sojourners to immigrants and from individuals to married couples, marital adaptation was introduced and 3 facets of adaptation were differentiated: psychological, sociocultural, and marital. Findings support the contention that adaptation is multifaceted. Consistent with stress and coping models, psychological adaptation was associated with the personality variable of hardiness, social support, acculturation attitudes, and discrimination. However, in line with social learning perspectives, sociocultural adaptation was mostly related to variables instrumental in acquiring social skills in the new culture, namely, language proficiency and contact with members of the dominant group. Marital adaptation was mostly associated with marital stressors and marital support. The lack of research on gender differences in the differentiation of adaptation was addressed. The effects of socioeconomic status and gender have also been examined.

A face-to-face interview was conducted in Korean using a structured questionnaire. Depression in this study was measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies of Depression (CES-D) Scale. A substantial percentage of the sample was experiencing a high level of depression. The mean score on the CES-D scale was 15.1, slightly below 16, a cut-off score for clinical depression, and almost 40% of the respondents scored 16 or above on the scale, indicating a high rate of clinical depression for the study sample.

Our investigation was grounded in the recent literature suggesting that cultural identity, adaptation, and the relationship between them are affected by contextual factors. We see the military in general, and the Israeli army in particular, as a highly assimilative context. We therefore predicted that national identity would significantly promote immigrant's adaptation. Three hundred and sixty-five young soldiers who had recently immigrated from the former Soviet Union and serving their compulsory military service in the Israeli Defense Forces, completed anonymous questionnaires. Our findings revealed that national identity was indeed positively related to adjustment, especially adjustment to the military setting. In contrast, ethnic identity was not correlated with adjustment. When classified into acculturation categories, according to Berry's bi-dimensional model, individuals in both the 'marginalization' and the 'separation' groups exhibited low levels of adaptation. Common to these two strategies is the rejection of host culture. Three factors--language abilities, sources of cohesion and goals in service--were examined as possible mediators for the effects of national identity on the immigrants' adjustment to military service. National identity was shown to affect adaptation partially through sources of cohesion and goals in service. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

Findings revealed mean age of initiation to be 18.3, 40% ever and 30% current users. Significant differences were reflected in smoking by gender, ethnicity, educational level, and marital and employment status. Males were more likely to be smokers. While knowledge and attitudes about smoking and secondhand smoke were associated with these variables, ethnic pride and smoking status played significant roles. Results indicated that while fathers and brothers had greater social influence on young male smoking behavior, smoking friends had influence on both genders. Additionally, both stages of change of smoking and acculturation impact on smoking varied with gender, age, and time living in U.S. Findings provide comprehensive insights into tobacco use among Asian Americans that reflect the need for developing culturally appropriate programs for this population.

The present study examined the psychological adjustment of 395 new immigrants to Israel from the former Soviet Union using a cross-sectional design. Results showed that the longer an immigrant stays in Israel, the greater the sense of loss of spiritual symbolic resources. It was also found that the greater the loss, the poorer the psychological adjustment. A significant correlation was found between three categories of symbolic resources (spiritual, physical, and social) and psychological adjustment to the new environment.

Assessment tools developed in the elder's own cultural context can maximize appropriate assessment and planning. This article describes the development of a tool for measuring adherence to tradition in Chinese elders. In Chinese tradition, an elder's purpose, meaning, and self-worth are derived, in large part, from their contribution to family, relatives, and the community. Existing measures of filial piety and acculturation do not capture this dimension. Filial piety involves being on the receiving end of care, honor, and obedience from younger generations. Acculturation is the opposite of adherence to tradition. One thousand five-hundred and two Chinese elders in China were asked questions on mutual aid and intergenerational exchange. Factor analysis extracted nine items loading into two factors reflective of traditional exchange. This measure could prove useful in understanding the effect of traditional beliefs upon various psychosocial outcomes.

The results supported the hypotheses that autonomous motivation to study abroad is a predictor of students' various adjustment outcomes at different times of the academic year and that the preservation goals have a weaker negative effect upon the adjustment outcomes and this effect is relatively independent from the effect of autonomy.

The sample consisted of 34 Spanish-speaking and 24 English-speaking couples. The results show that the husbands' level of affective femininity was predictive of the wives' level of dyadic adjustment. The wives' level of dyadic adjustment contributed more to the couples' overall level of dyadic adjustment than did the husbands. Negative behavior traits such as aggressive masculinity or submissive femininity did not yield significant results as predicted cultural stereotypes. In regards to acculturation, significant correlations were found between cultural lifestyle and dyadic adjustment. The relationship between gender identity and dyadic adjustment remain significant even when both cultural resistance (adherence to traditional culture) and cultural shift (assimilation to host culture) partialled out. As a result, no significant differences were found regarding gender identity and dyadic adjustment among participating couples.

Results indicated that older Koreans were more lonely than studies of older Caucasians. Ethnic attachment was the best predictive variable of loneliness and of both emotional and tangible social support. Ethnic attachment, living with spouse, and transportation availability had both direct effects on loneliness and indirect effects on loneliness through social support variables. The relationship between loneliness and age, marital status, English fluency, transportation availability, and living with children differed depending upon the level of social support variables. The only mediation effect of loneliness was between life satisfaction and both emotional and tangible social network size and satisfaction.

Current demographic trends indicate population growth for racial and ethnic minority groups is increasing considerably faster than the rate for the U.S. population as a whole. As part of a long-term plan for meeting public needs and building healthy urban parks and recreation services, it is important to assess and address the perceptions, values and needs of our nation's growing multi-cultural, diverse ethnic minority populations with respect to urban parks and forests and their management. Existing research has been inadequate in explaining how the recreational users' ethnic and sociocultural background affects their recreational experiences. This knowledge gap hinders a manager's ability to provide a high quality recreation experience for his/her recreation resource users by meeting their needs while managing the natural resources for recreational purposes. The purpose of this study was to examine differences in outdoor recreation characteristics, relevant to urban parks and forests, both across and within selected population subgroups. Specifically, this study examined inter-ethnic variations in outdoor recreation characteristics across various population subgroups, the influence of acculturation on intra-ethnic variability in outdoor recreation characteristics within ethnic subgroups, and acculturation-related patterns of variations in outdoor recreation characteristics of ethnic subgroups in comparison with the Anglo or White population. Household members belonging to five ethnic population subgroups-Hispanic/Latino or Hispanic American, Chinese or Chinese American, Japanese or Japanese American, Korean or Korean American, African American, and members of Anglo or White households residing in and around two greater metropolitan centers, namely Philadelphia, PA and Atlanta, GA were surveyed using Dillman's Tailored Design Approach. The survey instrument utilized by this study was a self-administered mail questionnaire in which subjects were asked about their park and forest-related outdoor recreation preferences, participation patterns, and activities. Owing to the existing inadequacy of explanations for ethnic differences in outdoor recreation patterns from broader sociopsychological perspectives, further theory-based research endeavors need to be undertaken to unravel reasons for such ethnic differences and/or similarities. Thus, the influence of cultural values and levels of acculturation on ethnic individuals' outdoor recreation participation patterns and preferences warrants in-depth examination in future research.

In addition, the study results indicated that emigre respondents over time are increasingly successful economically, satisfied with their new lives, acculturated to America and involved in Jewish activities. Study implications underscore the importance of new language acquisition for refugees and immigrants and the value of interpersonal cross-cultural contact between emigres and members of the indigenous culture in achieving successful resettlement. In addition, study results highlight the importance of the attitude of the host community in facilitating adjustment to a new culture. With regard to Jewish identification and involvement, study results suggest that initial resettlement assistance and Jewish acculturation are inseparable processes, and how emigres are initially treated may increase or discourage their Jewish identification to varying degrees.

One hundred and ten Turkish immigrants were surveyed through questionnaires. The majority of the participants migrated to Canada within the last ten years. Despite high educational attainments, two-thirds of the sample were either unemployed of underemployed. Inability to integrate fully into the labour force within the first six months in Canada was primarily attributed to the lack of competence in official languages and Canadian work experience, and the difficulty in getting credentials recognized. In time, these barriers seemed to be overcome. In their place, market conditions (e.g., low-paid jobs, inadequate work conditions, economic regression) delayed full integration into the work force. Models that were tested through structural equation modelling (LISREL VIII) revealed that adaptation was affected by both employment-related experiences and psychological well being. Perceived discrimination, acculturation attitudes, sense of coherence, migration motivation, and social networks moderated the relationship among employment-related experiences, psychological well-being and adaptation.

The question of how the native population experiences these developments is of prime importance for intercultural relations and sets the base for acculturation of immigrants. Drawing on attachment and multiculturalism research, we supposed here that general and specific feelings of security might be related to more positive attitudes toward cultural diversity, whereas feelings of threat might be related to less openness. More precisely, the present study investigated how nativesâ€™ general attachment (secure or fearful) as well as their specific feelings of (cultural or economic) security might be related to their expectations about acculturation of immigrants in the multicultural context of Luxembourg. The sample included N = 134 Luxembourg nationals with an average age of M = 45.02 (SD = 17.41) who filled out an online questionnaire. Results revealed that self-reported fearful general attachment was positively related to more unwelcoming acculturation orientations. Relations between general attachment and acculturation orientations were mediated by feelings of cultural security, which had strong effects on host nationalsâ€™ (un)welcoming acculturation orientations over and above general attachment. Findings suggest that (un)welcoming orientations toward immigrants, entailing openness for cultural contact and exchange, are related to feelings of cultural and economic security which are partly biased by a general secure or fearful attachment. Feelings of security seem thus to provide a secure base for tolerance and openness to cultural diversity which are needed in order to deal successfully with the challenges of todayâ€™s multicultural societies.

The present study used an acculturative stress model to examine the immigrant paradox with a sample of Mexican-origin mothers. Method: Mothers [N = 175; age = 33.52 (10.75)], who were foreign- or U.S.-born, were categorized as more acculturated or less acculturated based on cluster analyses using demographic and language proficiency variables. The association between acculturative status and depressive symptoms approximately 9 months later was tested with two models: with both cultural stressors (i.e., perceived discrimination, acculturative stress) and cultural assets (i.e., familismo, ethnic identity) as mediators, and with the effects of cultural stressors moderated by cultural assets. Results: Data provide some support for the validity of the mediation model. Less acculturated mothers reported (a) a stronger ethnic identity, which appears to have protected them from later depression, and (b) stronger familismo, which increased risk for later depression. In addition, discrimination was negatively related to later depression. Conclusions: We found support for the mediating role of cultural assets in the link between acculturation and depression, but some associations were in unexpected directions. These findings highlight the complexities of preserving core cultural characteristics among Mexican-origin mothers living in the United States, and the need to consider the context in which cultural processes unfold.

Socio-demographic and migration history, focusing on post-migration circumstances and experiences of discrimination in the host country, were obtained. Association between migration and post-settlement factors and mental health outcomes were assessed using adjusted logistic regression models. Prevalence of mental distress was high: 49.4% anxiety, 54.6% depression and 24.9% post-traumatic stress symptoms. After adjustment for family separation since migration, recent arrival in South Africa was associated with increased risk for depression (aOR = 4.0, 95% CI:1.3â€“11.8) and post-traumatic stress (aOR = 5.2, 95% CI:1.7â€“15.9), while in unadjusted models, older age on arrival was associated with anxiety (aOR = 5.3, 95% CI:1.4â€“19.8) and depression (aOR = 6.2, 95% CI:1.6â€“24.3). History of family separation since migration was independently associated with depression and post-traumatic stress in all models. Discriminatory experiences since migration was also an independent risk factor for all three mental health outcomes. Finally, being divorced/widowed was associated with an increased risk for post-traumatic stress, while higher income earners were protected against post-traumatic symptoms, even after adjustment. Refugees/migrants in South Africa show a significant burden of mental distress that is linked to challenges of adjustment in an often hostile context. Services addressing these and other health-related, social-economic needs should be developed as a priority.

In a sample of Jewish immigrants from the Former Soviet Union (FSU) in two different host countries, Germany and Israel, possible predictors of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and satisfaction with life (SWL) were examined. In total, 359 Jewish immigrants from the FSU living in Germany (n = 180) and Israel (n = 179) completed the questionnaire measuring immigration-related and sociodemographic characteristics. HRQoL was assessed via Short Form Health Survey Version 2 (SF-12v2), and SWL via Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). Hierarchical linear regression models were applied for analyzing immigration-related and sociodemographic predictors of HRQoL and SWL. Participants living in Israel scored higher on HRQoL, and no differences were found concerning SWL ratings. However, no direct influences of the host country were detected by predicting HRQoL and SWL scores. In both subgroups, immigration-related factors such as perceived discrimination or level of integration were found as significant predictors. In the face of different immigration waves in the host countries, Germany and Israel, the results display similarities rather than differences between the groups concerning the sociodemographic and immigration-related predictors on HRQoL and SWL. The findings using cross-cultural analysis level underscore the need of much more detailed future research on this issue.

A direct and negative relationship between health-seeking behaviors and depression, and an indirect relationship with acculturative stress, was observed mediated through depression. Social support had an important moderating influence on these effects. Although there was an inverse relationship between age and English language usage and depression, age was positively related to health-seeking behavior. Despite their long duration of stay, Filipino Australian migrants continue to experience acculturative stress and depression leading to lower health-seeking behaviors. This study highlights the importance of screening for acculturative stress and depression in migrants and fostering social support.

Three groups of respondents took part in the study: Israeli-born Jews (n = 1,082), immigrants from the Former Soviet Union in Israel (n = 237), and Jews living in Russia (n = 935). Differences in value preferences between the groups and their relationship with time in country in the immigrantsâ€™ value preferences were hypothesized on the basis of four psychological mechanisms: premigration formation of values and their preservation in the new country, self-selection of immigrants, acculturation (classical and paradoxical), and a reaction to the stress of adjustment in the new country. The results obtained demonstrated that the value system of immigrants in general was different from the value system of the nonimmigrant populations in both the country of origin and in the receiving country. When comparing immigrants and two other populations in each of the 19 basic values separately, it was found that immigrants reported higher levels of power dominance, power resources, and security social values, and lower levels of values of universalism tolerance, universalism concern, benevolence dependability, and self-direction thought than both the other groups. Results mainly corroborated what we have termed a Stress Reaction Value Constellation model. Adjustment difficulties encountered by immigrants in the receiving country and their survival needs may explain the specific pattern of value preferences found among immigrants.

The research focuses on the interrelationship between national and religious identities in Greece. It drew on Identity Process Theory (Breakwell, 1986), Roccas and Brewer's Social Complexity Model (2002) and the work of Kay Deaux (1993; Deaux, Reid, Mizrahi and Ethier, 1995) to investigate three ways that identities might interrelate: structure, content and motivations. Using self-completed questionnaires with some open-ended measures, and 7 semistructured interviews, Study 1 investigated the relationship between the strength of identification, centrality and content of national and religious identity elements. The sample consisted of 107 adult Greeks. Strong relationships were found between the levels of identification and centrality of the two identity elements as well as a large overlap in terms of content, both at an individual and the social representational level. In Study 2, a repeated-measures experimental design was used to investigate the relationship between the two identity elements before and after threat was induced in the principles of national distinctiveness and continuity. The sample consisted of 258 Greek students. It was shown that although the level of identification with each of the national and religious identities is predicted by their respective motivations, the same motivational principles (continuity and self-esteem) predicted levels of identification with the two identities. Furthermore, the motivational principles relating to each of the identity elements were strongly related to each other. Threat to national identity did not only affect the relative contribution that national identity made to the maintenance of the motivational principles but also affected the relative contribution made by the religious identity. Religious identification increased after threat, but most importantly, the relative contribution of its motivational principles changed as a response to the particular type of identity threat induced in the national identity. Study 3 examined the extent to which levels of perceived overlap between national and religious identity elements influence Greek nationals' acculturation preferences from the state and the immigrant/minority groups contextualised also for different domains (citizenship, education and intermarriage) and for different target groups (Albanians, Russian and Greek Moslems of Thrace). It obtained questionnaire data from 316 Greek adults. The results showed that levels of perceived overlap between the two identity elements, was strongly and positively associated with perceived threat to national identity and prejudice and affected differently the levels of endorsement of host majority acculturation in relation to the immigrant/groups and the state. The findings of the thesis are discussed in relation to how the relationships between multiple identities could be usefully conceptualised and how they may be used by individuals as coping strategies under the context of change and/or threat. It is also argued that inter-group perceptions can be better explained by taking into account multiple identities rather than the relative salience of single identities at a particular time.

Design: Ethnographic interviews followed by a survey. Cultural consensus analysis was used to test for the presence of group models, derive the 'culturally correct' set of beliefs, and compare models of normal memory loss and AD. Setting: Chicago, Illinois. Participants: One hundred eight individuals from local neighborhoods: African Americans, Mexican Americans, and refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Measurements: Participants responded to yes-or-no questions about the nature and causes of normal memory loss and AD and provided information on ethnicity, age, sex, acculturation, and experience with AD. Results: Groups held a common model of AD as a brain-based disease reflecting irreversible cognitive decline. Higher levels of acculturation predicted greater knowledge of AD. Russian speakers favored biological over psychological models of the disease. Groups also held a common model of normal memory loss, including the important belief that 'normal' forgetting involves eventual recall of the forgotten material. Conclusion: Popular models of memory loss and AD confirm that patients and clinicians are speaking the same 'language' in their discussions of memory loss and AD. Nevertheless, the presence of coherent models of memory loss and AD, and the unequal distribution of that knowledge across groups, suggests that clinicians should include wider circles of patientsâ€™ families and friends in their consultations. These results frame knowledge as distributed across social groups rather than simply the possession of individual minds.

We find that Mexican-white and Mexican-black segregation is higher in new Mexican gateways than in established areas and that, for Mexican-immigrant segregation from whites, this heightened level of residential segregation in new destinations can be explained by the high presence of unauthorized Mexican immigrants living there which tends to bolster segregation between the two groups. By contrast, Mexican-immigrant segregation from native-born blacks tends to be lower in areas with larger undocumented populations, a pattern that is especially true in new destinations. Neither of these opposing effects of legal status on Mexican-immigrant segregation can be explained by compositional differences in assimilation (English ability and earnings) between documented and undocumented immigrants nor by structural variation in metropolitan areas, suggesting a unique association between legal status and segregation.

We used data from the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study; a population-based prospective cohort of older Puerto Ricans recruited between the ages of 45 and 75 years. The Institutional Review Boards at Tufts Medical Center and Northeastern University approved the study. We used latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM) to identify different classes of two-year trajectories of stressful life events; analysis of variance to examine group differences by stress trajectory; and linear regression to test for the modifying effects of age at arrival on the association of stress trajectory with allostatic load at follow-up. In LGMM analysis, we identified three distinct stress trajectories; low, moderate ascending, and high. Unexpectedly, participants in the low stress group had the highest allostatic load at follow-up (F = 4.4, p = 0.01) relative to the other two groups. Age at arrival had a statistically significant moderating effect on the association. A reported two year period of moderate but repetitive and increasingly bad life events was associated with increases in allostatic load for participants who arrived to the U.S. mainland after the age of 5 years, and was particularly strong for those arriving between 6 and 11 years, but not for those arriving earlier or later. Results from this study highlight the complex effects of stress during the life course, and point to certain vulnerable periods for immigrant children that could modify long term effects of stress.

A few cross-cultural studies have shown that the Western pattern of face-to-face communication is absent in traditional rural cultures, without identifying other processes that promote emotional Co-regulation. The present study compared three different samples: Western middle-class families in Italy, rural traditional Nso farmer families in Cameroon, and West African sub-Saharan immigrant families in Italy using biweekly observations of 20 motherâ€“infant dyads from each cultural context from age 4 to 12 weeks. Longitudinal sequential analysis of maternal and infant behaviors showed that from as early as 4 weeks, in Italian dyads maternal affectionate talking is linked with infant active attention to mother in sequences of face-to-face contact; this link fosters the subsequent emergence of infant smiling/cooing, and then sequences of positive feedback between infant and maternal emotional expressions that, by the 3rd month, dynamically stabilize. In contrast, for Cameroonian/Nso dyads over the 2nd and 3rd month, maternal motor stimulation marked by rhythmic vocalizing is linked with infant active attention to surroundings. The relatively few smiling/cooing actions of Nso babies at their mothers were answered mainly with tactile stimulation that did not foster the maintenance of face-to-face visual contact.

However, the profound impact of different levels of language proficiency between immigrant spouses on their married life is an understudied topic. The current study explores whether differences between immigrant spouses in host language proficiency predict marital satisfaction in their first four years in the host country. Using a three-wave longitudinal study, with intervals of one to two years, we collected data from 316 married couples who immigrated from the Former Soviet Union to Germany and Israel. Language proficiency and marital satisfaction were measured via self-report questionnaires. We conducted an Actor-Partner Interdependence Model analysis to control for dyadic and time data dependencies. The results indicate that differences between spouses in their host language proficiency predict marital dissatisfaction, and that this effect is exacerbated over time. These associations held across gender and host country. The findings are discussed in light of the gap-distress model.

This two-phase study examined the relation between object relations and subjective well-being in this population. Phase I tested the psychometric properties of a Spanish version of the Bell Object Relations and Reality Testing Inventory (BORRTI-SV), translated for use in this study. Male and female participants (N = 139) were recruited via email and data were collected online. The results of exploratory factor analysis yielded a four-factor structure, with two factors demonstrating good internal consistency: Egocentrico--Dependiente (Egocentric--Dependent) and the Desconfianza (Mistrust) scale. Phase II of the study hypothesized that (a) immature object relations would predict lower levels of subjective well-being, (b), higher acculturative stress would negatively impact subjective well-being, and (c) high biculturalism and socioeconomic status would contribute to better subjective well-being. Both male and female participants ( N = 75) were recruited at three community-based social service programs. The results of hierarchical regression analyses suggested that individuals who experienced high levels of acculturative stress, were also less satisfied with their lives. This type of stress appeared to override other factors frequently associated with subjective well-being in this sample. Study results, limitations, and future directions are discussed.

Results: The immigrants of different gender, language and category sub-groups exhibited different drinking rates, drinking rates before immigration, drinking rates after immigration, drinking change rates and drinking belief change rates. Drinking change (drinking behavior change + drinking belief change) was correlated positively with mother tongue and negatively with gender. Drinking behavior change was negatively correlated with gender and category of immigration. Mother tongue and gender significantly impacted drinking change. Gender significantly impacted drinking behavior change. Conclusion: The immigrants of different sub-groups in Canada experienced different drinking change.

To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study of predictors of acculturative hassles in a refugee population. Results indicated that more communication problems and less Norwegian language competence were related to most hassles at T3. Higher psychological distress, lower quality of life, lower self-reported state of health, and less education at T3 were associated with higher levels of hassles at T3. More psychological distress at T2 and less education at arrival (T1) were significant predictors for more acculturative hassles at T3.

Based on the frameworks of the eco-cultural, psychosocial development, and social support theories, a quantitative cross-sectional design was used to examine the impact of gender, level of acculturation, educational level, age at the time of immigration, length of stay, and perception of social support on participants' help-seeking attitudes. Data were collected using a demographic questionnaire, the Iranian Self-Identity Acculturation Scale, Perceived Social Support Scale, and the Inventory of Attitudes Toward Seeking Mental Health Services. The impact of gender, levels of acculturation and education, younger age at the time of immigration, longer length of residency, and positive perception of social support on the attitudes toward seeking mental health services were tested using Pearson's correlation, ANOVA, t tests, and multiple regression. The results of the study showed that gender and education level were positively correlated and perceived social support was negatively correlated with attitudes toward seeking mental health services.

The socio-historical and economic background of the host country may play an important role in the mental health status of migrants. As studies are mostly conducted in developed countries, researching migration in developing countries may add important information to scientific literature. Aims: This study aims to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression symptoms in Haitian migrants in southern Brazil. Methods: The sample comprises 66 participants selected from four different sites in three cities of a Brazilian southern state. Participants fulfilled a sociodemographic questionnaire, as well as instruments investigate traumatic events; post-migration difficulties and symptoms of PTSD, anxiety and depression. Linear regression models were utilized to investigate factors associated with PTSD, anxiety and depression symptoms. Results: PTSD prevalence in the sample was 9.1%. Depression and anxiety symptoms were in the clinical range of 10.6%â€“13.6% of participants, respectively. A number of traumatic events, acculturation difficulties, discrimination and low social support were associated with the investigated mental health disorders.

This study was conducted on a sample of 23 non-randomly chosen Afghan immigrants who were at least 25 years of age, migrated to the United States after 18 years of age, and lived in the United States for at least 2 years. The participants were recruited from different cities, such as San Francisco, Sacramento, Minneapolis, Hartford, and Los Angeles. In this study, acculturative stress was measured using Suinn Lew Asian Self Identity Acculturation Scale (SL-ASIA) and depressive symptoms were measured using Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). Results indicate presence of a positive relationship between acculturative stress and depressive symptoms among Afghan immigrants who immigrated to the United States after 18 years of age. In the present study, individual identity, interpersonal relationships, language use, and cultural or traditional practices of most of the participants reflected and manifested Afghan heritage. Results further suggest that Afghan immigrants maintained their traditional customs and values while showing some acculturation to the U.S. culture.

The current study begins to address this gap by using latent profile analysis to examine the ways in which delinquency, gang involvement, civic engagement, political engagement, and openness to violent extremism cluster among Somali refugees. We then use multivariable regression analyses to examine how adversity (e.g., discrimination, trauma, and marginalization) is associated with the identified latent classes. Data were collected from 374 Somali refugee young adults (Mage = 21.30 years, SD = 2.90, range 18â€“30, 38% female) from 4 different North American communities. Participants completed a structured survey assessing their experiences of adversity, delinquent and/or violent attitudes and behaviors (e.g., attitudes toward violent extremism, participation in delinquent behaviors, involvement in gangs), and positive outcomes (e.g., civic and political engagement). Our findings indicate that participants fall into 5 distinct groups, and that social-contextual and individual factors are uniquely related to those groups.

Although research shows relatively positive attitudes of the autochthonous population towards immigration and ethnocultural diversity, there are also some hints about a gap between the discourse supporting multiculturalism and the actual demands of unilateral adaptation of immigrants to the host culture. Spain is relatively high on the diversity and policy indexes, but is in the middle of the integration index. The three MIRIPS hypotheses are evaluated by examining the mutual relations between Ecuadorean immigrants and the Spanish-born population. Since Ecuador is a former Spanish colony the choice of this immigrant target group has several implications for the evaluation of the MIRIPS hypotheses. Furthermore, the Spanish study was directed towards populations with actual contact and intercultural experience. To accomplish this goal, samples of both populations were drawn from the same neighborhood. This matching design also allows the partial control of external variables which may affect the possibility and content of mutual relationships, such as differences in SES, education and ghettoization.

Specifically, higher interconnectedness may reflect greater access to unmodified natural cultural representations and L2 communication practices, thus fostering communicative competence through observational learning. As such, structural aspects of migrantsâ€™ L2 social networks may be protective against acculturative stress arising from chronic communication difficulties. Results from a study of first generation migrant students (N = 100) support this idea by showing that both inclusiveness and density of the participantsâ€™ L2 network account for unique variance in CRAS but not in general acculturative stress. These results support the idea that research on cross-cultural adaptation would benefit from disentangling the various facets of acculturative stress and that the structure of migrantsâ€™ L2 network matters for language related outcomes. Finally, this study contributes to an emerging body of work that attempts to integrate cultural/cross-cultural research on acculturation and research on intercultural communication and second language learning.

Three hundred two Iranian immigrants aged 65 years and over who had lived in the Sydney Metropolitan area for at least six months participated. Data were collected using a written survey instrument, face-to-face interviews, and telephone interviews. Iranian immigrants had higher levels of psychological distress, more limited physical function, greater need for help or assistance with activities of daily living, lower feelings of wellbeing, and were much less likely to use aged care services than the general population of older Australians. Participants who did not speak English at home were more likely to experience psychological distress and had greater limitations in their physical functioning. Elderly Iranians with better English proficiency had lower levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms and reported less need for help and supervision in activities of daily living; they were also more likely to access health care services. Elderly Iranian immigrants experience higher levels of psychological distress and lower levels of physical function than the general population of older Australians; those with limited proficiency in English are at greatest risk. These findings contribute to the enrichment of multicultural policy, social fairness, access, and equity for ethnic aged people.

Immigrants' health is commonly expected to converge with the host population through acculturation. The aim of this analysis was to examine whether mothers' acculturation is associated with less-rapid weight gain in NZ Pacific children, and whether this differs by mothers' nativity. Methods: In a birth cohort of 1249 children followed 2000â€“2011, birth weight and weight and standing height, measured at years 2, 4, 6, 9, and 11, were quantified as sex- and age-specific weight (weight-for-age; WFA) and BMI z-scores. Maternal acculturation (range, 11â€“54) was assessed at baseline and years 4, 6, and 11. Results: In adjusted models using generalized estimating equations to account for repeated measures, maternal acculturation was not significantly associated with children's WFA or BMI z-scores overall. In stratified analyses, change in maternal acculturation score was inversely associated with WFA z-score change among children of NZ-born, but not immigrant, mothers (beta = âˆ’0.021; 95% confidence interval, âˆ’0.036 to âˆ’0.007; p = 0.006; interaction, p = 0.005). Conclusions: Our study provides the first evidence in a longitudinal sample that changes in maternal acculturation can influence children's growth, suggesting the importance of lifestyle or behavioral factors related to a mother's cultural orientation. Given the high risk of obesity and its related conditions in the NZ Pacific population, critical next steps are to identify mediating factors, as well as to understand the processes influencing growth among children of immigrant mothers.

The present research proposed a construct termed global orientation to denote individual differences in the psychological processes of acculturating to the globalizing world. It encompasses multicultural acquisition as a proactive response and ethnic protection as a defensive response to globalization. Ten studies examined the applicability of global orientations among majority and minority groups, including immigrants and sojourners, in multicultural and relatively monocultural contexts, and across Eastern and Western cultures. Multicultural acquisition is positively correlated with both independent and interdependent self-construals, bilingual proficiency and usage, and dual cultural identifications. Multicultural acquisition is promotion-focused, while ethnic protection is prevention-focused and related to acculturative stress. Global orientations affect individuating and modest behavior over and above multicultural ideology, predict overlap with outgroups over and above political orientation, and predict psychological adaptation, sociocultural competence, tolerance, and attitudes toward ethnocultural groups over and above acculturation expectations/strategies. Global orientations also predict English and Chinese oral presentation performance in multilevel analyses and the frequency and pleasantness of intercultural contact in cross-lagged panel models. We discuss how the psychological study of global orientations contributes to theory and research on acculturation, cultural identity, and intergroup relations.

Studies 1 and 2 were conducted among Polish immigrants in Ireland. These studies addressed personality comparisons between immigrants and nonimmigrant samples (Study 1: peer observations) and immigrant self-perceived changes (Study 2). Adaptive personality changes did occur as hypothesized, particularly in the domain of conscientiousness, which regulates work-related activities. This finding was restricted in Study 2 to a prospective time frame (change measured with time flow). Study 2 introduced four lifestyles: eudaimonia, hedonism, self-sacrifice, and alienation. Prospective change in conscientiousness favored eudaimonic lifestyle, but retrospective change predicted self-sacrifice. Participants in Study 3 were Eastern Slav and Vietnamese immigrants in Poland. Based on previous work on Confucian work dynamism, it was expected that Vietnamese would demonstrate greater work involvement, eudaimonic lifestyle, and thrift, compared to Slav immigrants. These hypotheses were confirmed, showing that within the general model of immigrant adaptation, there is room for cultural differences.

Results: Resettled refugees from Sudan evidenced a history of trauma. Less than 5% met criteria for posttraumatic stress but 25% reported clinically high levels of psychological distress. The results indicate that social support - particularly perceived social support from the migrant's ethnic community - play a significant role in predicting mental health outcomes.

The study starts with an initial literature review on the causes of mediaâ€™s impact on English language acquisition and acculturation. Television and the Internet are used as independent variables to predict the degree of acculturation. A total of two hundred and ten participants were college-aged students whose native language is Mandarin. The study incorporates both qualitative and quantitative research methods to elicit data and quantify on the surveyâ€™s feedback. A pre-designed questionnaire survey consisting of twenty-nine questions were handed out to 210 students randomly to elicit required responses. Hierarchical linear multiple regression analysis will be deployed to confirm the variables that have the most impact on acculturation. All participants demonstrated significant changes on acculturation as a result of their great interest and substantial time spent on the English media. Different results between the groups using demographic variables (religion, areas of residence, and gender) were entered to triangulate data. An arousing result was revealed when variables were added in multiple regression equations to anticipate types of media significantly affecting degree of acculturation. Furthermore, both TV and Internet represents effective variables in predicting degree of acculturation. Nevertheless, replication studies with different moderation variables such as religious beliefs and genders might be needed to validate this outcome. The paper concludes with possible implications for needed changes in current mal-practices and recommendations for future research that is required addressing the pertaining issues. Suggestions for further studies that would better accommodate these problems in a way that would assist foreign language educators in better understandings and appreciation for English language learners in Taiwan will be revealed.

By 2005, about 120 million Chinese rural villagers had migrated to work and reside in cities. Huge migration waves like these have triggered many social problems. Researchers from different disciplines of social sciences have therefore started to investigate the migrant issue. In this chapter, we focus on urban residents, and take a personality-psychological perspective to examine the impact of individual adult attachment styles on their attitudes toward the adaptation strategies adopted by the migrants. A sample of 457 Chinese urban residents from four cities was recruited for this study. Four types of adult attachment styles (preoccupied, fearful, secure, and dismissing) were measured by an Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ) (Hofstra etal., 2005). We described the acculturation strategies (integration, assimilation, separation, and marginalization) by using vignettes. The results show that a secure style stimulates a positive attitude toward the integration strategy; a preoccupied style tends to have a positive impact on the attitude toward the assimilation strategy; a dismissing or a fearful style significantly predicts the attitude toward the separation strategy; and a dismissing style is a good predictor for the attitude toward the marginalization strategy. Those findings to a large extent confirm our hypotheses and are consistent with previous findings. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are further discussed.

As they settle into the large urban cities, these internal migrants experience challenges that are similar to those of international migrants, and of members of ethnic groups who engage in the process of acculturation. Many see this flow as a problem, one that needs to be understood through research using evidence based on concepts and methods used in international acculturation research. In the present study, we examine the Urban Identity of 787 migrants, using the Migrant Workersâ€™ Urban Identity Questionnaire developed by Gui (2010). This instrument distinguishes two aspects of urban identity: social identity and place identity. In addition, 328 of these respondents were tested with the Satisfaction with Life Scale (Diener, Emmons, Larson, & Griffin, 1985) and the Global Self-Worth Scale (Huang & Yang, 1998). Findings show that the acculturation strategies model based on international immigrantsâ€™ identity can apply to the seasonal migrant workersâ€™ identity. With respect to their acculturation strategies: (1) different operationalisations of the second dimension in the two dimension model lead to a different classification of acculturation strategies; the â€˜deeperâ€™ the psychological phenomena the less migrant workers want to engage the national society; (2) different acculturation strategies were favored in social identity and place identity domains; (3) data from the Satisfaction with Life Scale and the Global Self-Worth Scale shows, by and large, that integration is the best acculturation strategy (and the marginalization the worst) for achieving wellbeing in both social identity and in place identity. This corresponds to findings and conclusions of much of the previous research on acculturation based on international migration.

This was run as part of a fine arts teacher-training course at a culturally-diverse college in Southern Brazil. The project arose from a perceived need to transform art history teaching in Southern Brazil from being an instrument of acculturation to a process of cultural empowerment, and to enable it to be more closely aligned to the current requirements of preparing art teachers to be educators of culturally reflective visual readers. The design of the alternative programme requires changes in course content and teaching strategies. The research into the processes and impact of the alternative programme involved collecting data through observations, semi-structured interviews (individual and group), questionnaires, and tasks (assignments, reading, and critical appraisals). The analysis of this data showed that changes were possible without impairing the students' engagement with art history as a field of study. It was also found that art education and history can play a role in shaping the aspirations of immigrant families and their plans for social mobility, in examining the influence of their descendants' education in the arts on their families' plans for social mobility, it became apparent that Eurocentric art history education, which the alternative programme had sought to avoid, could still be appropriate to the social context of the students because of the value placed on it by their families. The findings of the study suggest that the students benefited from the changes introduced to the teaching programme since they led them to reflect on their own social and cultural structures, and allow them to become teachers able to employ the kind of art history teaching they prefer, even if it retains Eurocentric features.

Immigrants can invest in these assets to create wealth and improve their welfare. Research indicates that many immigrants do not invest in financial assets in the United States because they have low education, are unemployed, or have low income. The problem addressed in this study was low financial market participation among African immigrants in Connecticut despite high education and employment. The purpose of this qualitative multiple case study was to explore their perceptions of why they did not invest in financial assets to build wealth. A sample of 15 educated and employed African immigrants were selected by purposive snowball and criterion sampling from a personal list, and specific sites. Three research questions asked African immigrants to describe what they perceived impeded their participation, what they could do, or might be done to help them participate, and whether or not lack of financial literacy was part of the problem. In this study, multiple data collection methods were conducted including informal face-to-face, open-ended semi-structured/unstructured interviews, online questionnaires, telephone interviews, and document review. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analyses to identify themes related to the research questions. Results indicated that low financial literacy was the most important factor contributing to low financial market participation among educated and employed African immigrants. Acculturation apathy, impinging on the ability to learn and embrace American values might contribute to low financial literacy among African immigrants. Pointedly, African cultural anchors doused with religious beliefs, which undermine hard work and preparedness for the future, may also contribute to low financial participation. Recommendations for practice include providing African immigrants with financial literacy education by community- based organizations, non-profits, service providers, and financial institutions. Future research should explore how African cultural and religious beliefs might influence financial behaviors. This study was limited to African immigrants in Connecticut; future research may replicate this study in different geographical locations, or explore how two different groups- Christians and Muslims, operating under the same economic and cultural environment in Africa perceive money and wealth.

Suinn et al, 1987) among a sample of 259 Vietnamese and Cambodian immigrant mothers (mean age 40 yrs) in the US. The results suggest that the scale may not have measurement equivalence across these two Southeast Asian samples. Hence, caution is needed in interpreting data collecting using this measure.

These have usually been studied in isolation from each other, but their intersection is of increasing importance for understanding intercultural relations in plural societies. Although this mutual view of intercultural relations has long been recognised, there has been an imbalance in the research carried out: acculturation studies have been predominantly done with the non-dominant groups, and ethnic attitudes have been studied mainly among dominant populations. Beginning in the 1970s, we began a program of research to redress this imbalance with studies in Canada. We examined the acculturation expectations held by the dominant population with respect to immigrants and ethnocultural groups, using the concept of multicultural ideology; we also examined the ways in which dominant groups change and respond to the presence of such groups using concepts of security (both cultural and economic), tolerance, and ethnic attitudes. More recently, we have developed a research instrument to continue this program. The International Study of Attitudes Towards Immigration and Settlement examines the views of members of various ethnocultural groups in a number of countries. This paper reviews the research framework and some findings from these studies among various members of the larger society. The role of a number of demographic and psychological variables related to attitudes toward the kinds and numbers of immigrants are presented. Some conclusions and implications are then discussed.

This cross-sectional study aims to evaluate the prevalence of psychotic symptoms among Romanian immigrants living in very poor conditions at an abandoned hotel in Bologna and to highlight the possible correlation with general health status, distress and sociodemographic characteristics. Methods: The Psychosis Screening Questionnaire (PSQ) and General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) were administered to all immigrants residing at the hotel during two index days with the help of a cultural mediator. Socio-demographic, migration and health characteristics were also collected. Results: Sixty eight subjects were evaluated. More than 80% had left Romania for economic reasons. Of immigrants, 57% exceeded the four-point GHQ-12 threshold of potential mental disorder and 19% scored positively at the PSQ. Immigrants with positive PSQ showed higher mean GHQ-12 scores (5.9 Â± 3.5 vs. 3.8 Â± 2.75; p = 0.02). The development of post-migration health problems significantly predicts positive PSQ cases even after adjusting for age, sex and GHQ-12 dichotomized score (OR = 21.2, CI = 1.1â€“169.4). Conclusion: This community of immigrants living in deprived conditions showed a high prevalence of distress and psychotic symptoms, related to health problems.

This study explored SLA across different social contexts in a sample of 190 adult immigrants from Latin America to Australia who spoke Spanish as their first language (L1) and English as their second language (L2). The aims were to (a) investigate the presence and severity of SLA among L2 long-term immigrants, and (b) examine sources of individual differences in SLA. Results indicated that SLA exists among L2 immigrants at moderate, high and very high levels, and that levels of anxiety vary significantly across social contexts. Self-perceived L2 proficiency was found to be the strongest predictor of SLA followed by extroversion and age, with higher scores on all three variables associated with lower SLA.

Some groups, particularly in Southern Brazil, have retained their original cultural traditions, whilst acquiring elements of the typical local Brazilian cultural identity. This is the first study designed to formally evaluate biculturality in Brazil. Objective: To psychometrically assess and validate the Portuguese version of the Bicultural Scale (BS) in Brazil. Methods: The BS was adapted and translated to Portuguese and tested for the first time in Brazil in a sample of descendants (n = 160) from four immigrant groups and respective locations in Southern Brazil. A series of psychometric tests were conducted in order to examine the validity of the Portuguese version of the BS. Analyses of variance across scores for all subgroups were also conducted. Results: Factor analysis revealed two main factors contributing to most of the variance in scores. The 10 items measuring affiliation with minority cultural characteristics and the typical Brazilian culture yielded Cronbachâ€™s alpha coefficients of 0.69 and 0.78 respectively, whereas the overall Cronbachâ€™s alpha for all 20 items of the BS was 0.67. There was a significant correlation between items related to the typical Brazilian culture and the generation since immigration of research participants (r = 0.23, p = 0.004).

Central American immigrants represent a population that is a part of the Latino/Hispanic Diaspora in the United States. By the year 2050 the United States population will experience a great change in the ethnic/racial demographics and most will be former minorities comprising over 45% racial minorities (U.S. Census, 2005). Thus, it becomes more important for counselor educators and other helping professionals to understand how to adequately assess the 'Latino' and be culturally sensitive â€” especially since Central American immigrants come from diverse backgrounds, and although they may be labeled 'Hispanic,' there is diversity within groups of ethnic minorities. This dissertation examined the research hypotheses: There is a relationship between acculturation level and PTSD among Central American immigrants in the United States. In addition, there are predictive relationships among the demographic variables. The null hypotheses presented are: There is no relationship between acculturation level and PTSD among Central American immigrants in the United States and additionally, there are no predictive relationships among the demographic variables. A Pearson correlation design was done to assess statistical significance (both positive and negative), and to examine if there was a relationship between acculturation level and PTSD. The alpha level was set at a significance level of .05. A standard Multiple Regression design was utilized to assess predictive relationships among the demographic variables with PTSD severity: migration reason, age, gender, migration year, and marital status. The sample represented an n = 63 out of 100 participants who volunteered to participate in the study. The results show that there was a relationship between acculturation level and PTSD among Central American immigrants. Several instruments were utilized for this dissertation research to assess both acculturation level and prevalence or lack of PTSD severity. The AMAS-ZABB (Abbreviated Multidimensional Acculturation Scale) and the PCL-C (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Civilians) were utilized in this study. The results showed a positive correlation between acculturation level (U.S. identity, r = .289), Latino identity (r = .281), and PTSD. At an alpha level of Î± .01, age was positively correlated (r = .684) and acculturation level (English language) was negatively correlated with PTSD (r = -.465). Multiple R for regression was statistically significant when examining the demographic variables of age, acculturation level (English Language) and migration reason. The results were also statistically significant in predicting PTSD severity.

In this study, we took into account that MDD is a gene-environment disorder, in which stress is a critical component, and used whole-genome screening of functional variants to investigate the â€˜missing heritabilityâ€™ in MDD. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using single- and multi-locus linear mixed-effect models were performed in a Los Angeles Mexican- American cohort (196 controls, 203 MDD) and in a replication European-ancestry cohort (499 controls, 473 MDD). Our analyses took into consideration the stress levels in the control populations. The Mexican-American controls, comprised primarily of recent immigrants, had high levels of stress due to acculturation issues and the European-ancestry controls with high stress levels were given higher weights in our analysis. We identified 44 common and rare functional variants associated with mild to moderate MDD in the Mexican-American cohort (genome-wide false discovery rate, FDR, <0.05), and their pathway analysis revealed that the three top overrepresented Gene Ontology (GO) processes were innate immune response, glutamate receptor signaling and detection of chemical stimulus in smell sensory perception. Rare variant analysis replicated the association of the PHF21B gene in the ethnically unrelated European-ancestry cohort. The TRPM2 gene, previously implicated in mood disorders, may also be considered replicated by our analyses. Whole-genome sequencing analyses of a subset of the cohorts revealed that Europeanancestry individuals have a significantly reduced (50%) number of single nucleotide variants compared with Mexican-American individuals, and for this reason the role of rare variants may vary across populations. PHF21b variants contribute significantly to differences in the levels of expression of this gene in several brain areas, including the hippocampus. Furthermore, using an animal model of stress, we found that Phf21b hippocampal gene expression is significantly decreased in animals resilient to chronic restraint stress when compared with non-chronically stressed animals. Together, our results reveal that including stress level data enables the identification of novel rare functional variants associated with MDD.

This study was exploratory in nature and intended to measure the ten critical incident scenarios that were elicited in an earlier Pilot study or Phase I (Shalita & Spokane, 1997). Section I of the questionnaire (or Phase II) asked subjects to measure each of the ten critical incident scenarios against each other. Section II of the questionnaire asked Israeli and Non-Israeli participants to rate each of the ten critical incident scenarios against the theoretical underpinnings of each of five models of biculturalism (assimilation, acculturation, alternation, multiculturalism, and fusion) outlined by LaFromboise, et al's (1993) investigation entitled: 'Psychological impact of biculturalism: Evidence and theory.' One hundred twenty eight subjects (66 Israelis and 62 non-Israeli) returned completed questionnaires that were used for the MDS analysis. The (1) all subjects, (2) Israelis subjects only, and the (3) non-Israelis subjects only analyses all resulted in three-dimensional best-fitting solutions. The ten critical incident scenarios were best explained by the Assimilation, and Acculturation models of biculturalism. Recommendations for future research and insights fostering a better understanding of this population are delineated.

Cross-cultural methodology approximates research on intra-country issues, since comparing groups with different characteristics within countries may also reflect different 'cultures' represented by each of the differential groups. A question of bias elimination is raised when such comparisons are attempted either under a Cross-Cultural or an intra-country scope. Taking the van de Vijver and Leung and the Poortinga and van de Vijver theories on bias in terms of culture as a starting point, a triple-fold paradigm employing factor analysis and other techniques is presented on: (a) the application of simple congruence coefficients in estimating factor similarity -that is, basic factor equivalence testing- along with a proposed method of taking advantage of the Tucker coefficient matrix for a set of two or more factor structures, (b) the within-country application of multilevel covariance structure analysis and Procrustean rotations for a set of between groups and pooled-within correlation matrices, and (c) the reduction of 'bias in terms of culture' by eliminating variance components through multivariate methods. By incorporating some of these methods in standard -within country- psychological research, we should be able to gain on theoretical and psychometric grounds and we may finally question the degree of construct similarity among groups within a country, which cannot be necessarily taken for granted. These considerations are closely related to the use of multilevel analyses, as these stem from Cross-Cultural Psychology through most forms of intracountry and/or inter-country comparisons.

The present study aimed to identify the association between dietary patterns and the metabolic syndrome (MS) in South Asians living in the UK. Methods: Dietary patterns were derived by principal component analysis from 15 different food groups using an ethnic-specific food frequency questionnaire. MS risk factors, including obesity and hypertension, were measured, whereas existing conditions of dyslipidaemia and hyperglycaemia were self-reported. Participants (n = 100) were divided into quartiles based on dietary factor scores and the link between dietary patterns and risk factors was investigated. Results: Three different patterns were derived, which together explained 46% of the total diet variation; eastern pattern, mixed pattern and western pattern. An inverse correlation was found between the eastern pattern and education P = 0.05). A direct correlation was found between the western pattern and physical activity (P = 0.05) and the overall risk of MS (P = 0.05). Body composition was altered as residence time in the UK increased, with a reduction in muscle mass (29â€“26%) and an increase in body fat (31â€“37%). Diagnosis criteria for MS were found in 20% of the participants. Conclusions: Dietary acculturation, including a reduction in vegetarianism, an increased intake of caffeinated drinks and altered meal patterns, may be associated with the higher prevalence of MS in migrant South Asians in the UK.

Secondarily, we aimed to examine the relationships between the presence of these resources and depression, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation. Participants underwent an intensive semistructured interview and completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS). Content analyses of interviews revealed 10 psychosocial reserve capacity resources: religion/God as a source of emotional support, satisfaction with social support, feeling supported by romantic partner, having somebody to confide in, having friends in the United States, showing hope toward the future, having an end goal (e.g., saving for a house in Mexico), feeling a sense of control over her life, showing pride in the fact that she is able to support her family through farm work, and showing endurance. The aggregate protective influence of the available psychosocial resources was negatively associated with depression (r = âˆ’.35), hopelessness (r = âˆ’.28), and suicidal ideation (r = âˆ’.29); however, none of these associations were statistically significant. Although stress is inherent to the MFW lifestyle, we found many protective psychosocial resources available to help mitigate stress.

A sample of California residents of Korean descent were interviewed and followed-up 2 or 3 times by telephone during 2001-2009. The questionnaires dealt with SRH, lifestyle behaviors (smoking, physical activity, and fast food consumption), and socioeconomic measures. Statistical analysis included random-intercepts longitudinal regression models predicting change in SRH. A similar percentage of respondents reported improved and deteriorating SRH (30.3% and 29.1%, respectively). Smoking, consumption of fast foods, age, percentage of life spent in the United States, and being female were predictors of deteriorating SRH, whereas physical activity, education, and living with a partner were predictive of improvement in SRH. The effect of immigration on SRH is influenced by socioeconomic factors and lifestyle practices. Results support promotion of healthy lifestyle practices among immigrants.

According to regulatory focus theory, promotion-focused self-regulation is concerned with nurturance and accomplishment needs and involves the pursuit of wishes and aspirations. As such, it results in sensitivity to positive outcomes and to relative pleasure from gains. On the other hand, prevention-focused self-regulation is concerned with security needs and is directed at meeting duties and obligations. As such, it results in sensitivity to negative outcome and relative pain from losses. In Study 1, as predicted, the extent of promotion focus (i.e., a concern with accomplishment and the pursuit of ideals) predicted more positive attitudes to culturally similar and economically beneficial migrants, whereas the extent of prevention focus (i.e., concern with security and meeting obligations) predicted more negative attitudes to migrants who are culturally dissimilar. In Study 2 we replicated and extended these findings, showing that the extent of promotion focus and a lack of concern with threats predicted positive attitudes to both culturally similar and economically beneficial migrants, which, in the case of the latter group, was mediated by a focus on the benefits these migrants provide. In the case of culturally dissimilar migrants, the extent of promotion focus and a concern with gains predicted more positive attitudes. However, for economically less beneficial migrants, neither the extent of promotion nor prevention focus was a predictor. Only lower concerns with threat predicted more positive attitudes to this migrant group. The results are discussed with respect to other determinants of attitudes to migrants and the implications for migration and asylum-seeker policy.

Looking beyond statistics and architectural spectacles, I examine a seemingly personal choice in Shanghai, speaking Putonghua Mandarin, the official language, or the Shanghai dialect. This study contextualizes the contested urban linguistic space, and illustrates the political, social, and cultural conditions in this China's globalizing city. Through archival research, fifty in-depth interviews, two hundred and fifty survey questionnaires, and ethnographic fieldwork in Shanghai in the fall and winter of 2013, I document the impact of three sets of state policies driving the Shanghai dialect to the brink of extinction, and reactions of Shanghairen (Shanghai people) to preserve their linguistic heritage, and to safeguard their place-bound identity. First, state language policies systematically put Shanghai dialect at a discriminated position, through a nationalist agenda associating the official language with patriotism, and upward social mobility. In response to this state-sponsored language oppression, a grassroots dialect preservation movements struggles to protect Shanghai's linguistic heritage. Second, urban redevelopment policies to accommodate the infrastructure demanded by a global city displaced more than one million Shanghai households out of the urban center. It not only deprives them of the urban central residency, challenges their claim to urban public space, but also disperses the Shanghai dialect community. Facing an urban built environment bearing little relevance to Shanghai's history and long-time residents, Shanghairen rejects newly-built architectural spectacles and articulates an alternative image of cosmopolitan Shanghai located in the historical urban center. The third reason behind the rapid decline of Shanghai dialect speaking is the influx of millions of internal migrants, and the selective social integration of these non-speakers in Shanghai after reforms of the household registration (hukou) system. Instead of a dual society characterized by those with a Shanghai urban hukou and those without, my study suggests a more nuanced social class restructuring. On the one hand, migrants now have better overall chances for social acceptance and integration as institutional barriers represented by an individual's hukou status have receded; on the other hand, social and cultural boundaries are effectively maintained through language and lifestyle. Only those highly educated and wealthy newcomers are accepted on the job market and in social circles, while less-educated rural migrants are excluded. To synthesize, in exchange for Shanghai's global city status and improved standard of living, Shanghairen have been relocated away from the urban center, while their linguistic right to the city is threatened. They have also experienced relative deprivation of privileges in terms of exclusive access to employment and top quality social services. In this study, they come together to tell a story of the price locals pay when an authoritarian, centralized state fashions a city compatible with and competitive for globalization.

Some of the determinants of access to care are knowledge and perceptions of dementia, which may vary between ethnic groups in the population. The aims of this study were to compare knowledge and perceptions of dementia and Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) among four ethnic groups in Copenhagen, Denmark, and to assess the influence of education and acculturation. Methods: Quantitative survey data from 260 participants were analyzed: 100 native Danish, and 47 Polish, 51 Turkish, and 62 Pakistani immigrants. Knowledge and perceptions of dementia and AD were assessed with the Dementia Knowledge Questionnaire (DKQ) supplemented with two questions from the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Awareness Test (ADAT). Knowledge and perceptions of dementia and AD in the four groups were compared, and the influence of education and acculturation was assessed. Results: Group differences were found on the DKQ total score as well as all sub-domains. Turkish and Pakistani people were most likely to hold normalizing and stigmatizing views of AD. Level of education and acculturation had limited influence on dementia knowledge, accounting for 22% of the variance at most and had only minor influence on perceptions of AD. Conclusions: Lacking knowledge and certain perceptions of dementia and AD may hamper access to services in some ethnic minority groups. Ongoing efforts to raise awareness that dementia and AD are not part of normal aging, particularly among Turkish and Pakistani communities, should be a high priority for educational outreach.

Particularly, the study aimed to test the distinct role of stereotypes (especially the warmth dimension) and perceived threat (especially realistic threat) in predicting the majority's perception of adaptation and the need for immigrants to adapt. Spanish participants (N =307) responded to a questionnaire assessing Moroccan, Romanian, and Ecuadorian immigrants, reporting their perceptions of adaptation and the need for immigrants to adapt to the host society, on two dimensions of stereotypes (warmth and competence), perceived (realistic and symbolic) threat, and intergroup similarity. Results showed that the majority's perceptions about immigrants were specific to the immigrant target assessed. The psychosocial variables that predicted perception of adaptation and need to adapt differed depending on the immigrant target assessed, although warmth generally predicted perception of adaptation, and perceived threat generally predicted need to adapt. Accordingly, warmth was found to be a mediator in predicting perception of adaptation, whereas perceived realistic threat was a mediator when predicting the need to adapt. Intergroup similarity was a reliable mediator in both perception of adaptation and need to adapt. Overall, warmth seemed to be more closely related with acculturation perceptions, whereas perceived threat was more related with acculturation preferences.

Accordingly, how individuals from the various ethnic groups regard themselvesâ€”and othersâ€”is a salient focus of research studies across the disciplines. Measuring race and ethnicity gathers psychological measures of common phenomena such as racial identity, acculturation, and intra- and intergroup relations enabling researchers to compare concepts across groups and better evaluate differences and disparities. Most of the instruments date from the 1990s and later, while a number of still useful earlier scales are included. Taken together, these tools strengthen a wide evidence base, and point to areas where new scales are warranted. Included in this volume: fourteen measures for African Americans, such as the Rejection Sensitivity Race Questionnaire and the Cultural Mistrust Inventory; eight Caucasian-specific instruments, including the Race and Politics Survey and the Being White in America Scale; sixteen acculturation scales for Latinos, some specific to Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and ChÃ­canos; seven Asian/Pacific Islander measures, including the Race-Related Stressor Scale and the Intergenerational Congruence in Immigrant Families Scale; the Native American Acculturation Scale; and seventeen generic measures, including the Experience of Discrimination Scale and the Scale of Ethnocultural Empathy.

The aim of this study was to explore the differences in health locus of control and control beliefs between HIV infected patients from sub-Saharan Africa with and without a lifetime experience of migration. Methods: A sample of 62 HIV infected consecutive patients referred to the HIV clinics at the University Hospital of MÃ¼nster (Germany) and at the Rubaga Hospital Kampala (Uganda) were enrolled into this study. We compared three groups of patients: sub-Saharan African migrants, German patients, and local Ugandan patients. We used the German health and illness related control beliefs questionnaire (KKG), the Competence and control beliefs questionnaire (FKK), and the Powe Fatalism Inventory-HIV/AIDS-Version (PFI-HIV/AIDS-Version) and translated these scales into English and Luganda. In addition, the patients' sociodemographic, acculturation, clinical, and immunological data were registered. Results: Significant results were shown in HIV related external locus of control between migrated sub-Saharan African and local Ugandan patients compared to German patients. General control beliefs showed no significant differences. In the PFI-HIV-Version, there was a significant difference between migrated sub-Saharan African and Ugandan patients compared to German patients. Conclusions: Our data suggest that the experience of migration does not influence the locus of control.

Stage is a composite measure of tobacco norms of a country: smoking prevalence, cigarette consumption, and tobacco-related morbidity. The Lopez model characterizes the changing relationship between smoking prevalence and tobacco-related mortality and morbidity as a country progresses through the 4 successive stages of the tobacco epidemic. Methods: Survey data from Southeast Asian and Latino immigrants (from stage 1 and stage 2 countries) (n = 2,076) were used to evaluate stage of tobacco epidemic of country of emigration. Stage was compared with standard acculturation measures and community identification measures to understand post-immigration smoking behavior in the United States. Comparative analysis by stage and gender includes bivariate associations and logistic regression models to predict post-immigration smoking behavior. Results: Males: Pre-immigration prevalence and consumption rates of our study sample conform to prevalence and consumption of stage 1 and stage 2 countries predicted by the Lopez model. Post-immigration smoking uptake is equivalent to pre-immigration uptake for stage 1 males. The uptake rate for stage 2 males post-immigration is significantly lower (22.1%) than pre-immigration uptake (41.4%). Stage is a statistically significant predictor of post-immigration smoking uptake (OR = 3.08, CI = 1.82â€“5.22, p < .01). Females: Stage of country of birth is not significantly predictive of post-migration smoking uptake. Conclusions: The finding of stage to be a strong predictor of post-immigration smoking behavior among males provides a promising measurement tool. Prevalence and consumption of females in our study sample support the need for revisions to the stage model.

A random list from the registration office with 1,000 persons stratified by age and gender was retrieved from the population registry and these persons were contacted using a three-stage design including written information, telephone calls and personal contact at home. A female bilingual interviewer contacted persons with Turkish names. Of the persons on the list, 202 were not living in the area, one was deceased, 502 did not respond. Of the 295 responders, 152 explicitly refused (51.5%) to participate. We retained a sample of 143 participants (48.5%) representing the rate of multi-ethnicity in the area (52.1% migrants in the sample vs. 53.5% in the population).

Polish migrants (2.1 vs. 5.3% in the population) and persons from the former Yugoslavia (1.4 vs. 4.8% in the population) were under-represented.

"406","Search2020","thesis",2001,"Sakamoto, Izumi","Negotiating multiple cultural contexts: Flexibility and constraint in the cultural selfways of Japanese academic migrants",1,NA,"In past decades, social work has been motivated to address cultural differences. Nevertheless, there is little social work literature that critically examines how culture and the process of adaptation are conceptualized. Most of the literature has relied on fixed views of culture and acculturation, and fails to move beyond the concepts historically provided by the social science disciplines. In contrast, this dissertation constructs a dynamic model of cultural negotiation. A multi-method research project, inspired and informed by community-based research with multinational academic migrant families, was designed to investigate the boundaries and processes of culture as experienced. The two research methods addressed questions regarding the flexibility of cultural selfways. First, in-depth interviews were conducted to examine the experiences of Japanese academic migrant families, where a grounded theory analysis revealed the complex and fluid nature of cultural negotiation. These migrants expressed a sense of agency in the processes of negotiating multiple cultural contexts (e.g. transculturation), which was variously affected by occupational status, social power, gender (roles), and family relations. Concepts of Family-Based Cultural Adaptation and a Kaitenzushi/Smorgasbord Model of Cultural Adaptation emerged, leading to a new model depicting the non-linear, fluid, and uneven nature of cultural negotiation and transculturation. Second, an experiment tested whether the flexibility of cultural selfways reported in the interviews held true across cultural contexts. Ninety-one Japanese migrants in the US were randomly assigned to either the 'Japanese culture'-salient condition or the 'American culture'-salient condition, and responded to a questionnaire regarding cultural selfways in areas with known nationality differences between Japanese and Americans. The cultural environment was manipulated by changing the people, decor, and language in the room. Ninety-one American students served as comparisons. The results partially supported the thesis of flexible cultural selfways over immediate cultural contexts, and also highlighted the complex nature of cultural adaptation, which simultaneously involves both flexibility and rigidity, thus lending partial support to the new Model of Cultural Negotiation. The Model of Cultural Negotiation affords more sophisticated understandings of the properties of culture, by making room for the malleability of cultural socialization and for multiple identities. Implications for social work are discussed.

"407","Search2020","thesis",2011,"Thikeo, Manivone","Cambodian and Laotian Americans' cultural values and attitudes toward seeking professional psychological services",0,"not migration","Several studies have reported that Asian Americans, including Cambodian and Laotian Americans, tend to under utilize mental health services, both inpatient and outpatient although they display high levels of psychological problems related to significant psychological trauma experienced in their native land or while living in refugee camps. Underutilization may not be related to the lack of need but it may relate to cultural factors such as shame and stigma as well as acculturation and lack of health insurance. Although some Asian American research about help seeking exists, no previous research has specifically addressed this question with a Cambodian and Laotian population. This study was designed to investigate demographic and acculturation variables that might help understand why. This study used data from 108 Cambodians and Laotians adults (18+) living in Rhode Island. Participants completed (1) a demographic questionnaire sheet; (2) the Sin-Lew Asian Self Identity Acculturation Scale (AS-ASIA); (3) the Attitude Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help Scale (ATSPPHS). Results show that only one demographic variable, gender, demonstrated a robust relationship with help seeking, with females being significantly more likely than males to recognize the need for help, have less stigma about seeking help, be more open to discussing problems and more confident that professional services would be of assistance. In contrast, neither age, nor education having health insurance was significantly related to help seeking. Level of acculturation was strongly related to help seeking, contributing, in hierarchical regression analyses, unique variance over and above the set of demographic variables. Further, acculturation was related to two specific dimensions of help seeking (e.g., openness to discussing problems and confidence in professional help). A discussion of tailoring change efforts to these particular dimensions as well as females is offered as useful in engaging Laotian and Cambodian populations. Further, females are not only likely to seek help but they are also able to influent others, especially males, to seek help through their traditional role as a 'wives and mother.' Limitations of this research are discussed and suggestions made for future research efforts.

Background: There is growing concern about how to provide the care required by an ageing population. Although elder care has usually been provided by family members, this role is increasingly being fulfilled by immigrant caregivers with no formal training. Design: Caseâ€“control study (burdened/non-burdened according to the Zarit Burden Interview). Methods: The study took place between May 2005â€“October 2009. Anonymous questionnaires were distributed to 110 immigrant caregivers and their corresponding older care recipients (n = 110), who were receiving care in their homes in Barcelona (Spain). The questionnaires included measures of burden, social support, quality of life and social integration, and items about the physical/psychological status of the care recipient and the nature of the care tasks. Two groups of immigrant caregivers were defined according to their scores on the Zarit Burden Interview: burdened (n = 55) and non-burdened (n = 55). Results: Burdened caregivers reported less social support, a poorer quality of life, and problems with social integration. Furthermore, 48% said that they lacked knowledge about the care task, while 44% had difficulty performing certain care tasks, which constitutes a risk situation. Conclusion: Burden among untrained immigrant caregivers may be reduced by improving their social support systems and quality of life, thereby helping to ensure the availability of the caregiver services, which society increasingly needs.

The final sample consisted of 40 Turkish migrant children, 56 German urban middle-class children, 47 German rural children, 61 Turkish urban middle-class children, and 21 Turkish rural children. The children of the five cultural milieus did not differ in age, gender distribution, or human figure drawing ability. Besides the drawings, the mothersâ€™ sociocultural orientation was assessed, as well as migrant mothersâ€™ involvement in the German and Turkish cultures. The results revealed similarities between Turkish migrant children's self- and family-depictions with those of children from their culture of origin, particularly in some categorical features such as gender-specific characteristics, torso type, and neighbors. On the other hand, however, the drawings differed from those of Turkish rural children in the size of the depicted self. These findings are in line with the specific ecocultural context and the cultural orientation of Turkish migrant families toward psychological autonomy and hierarchical relatedness. It can therefore be concluded that Turkish migrant children's drawings are influenced by both their culture of origin, probably mediated by their familial socialization, and their social experiences in Germany.

A cross-sectional survey was conducted on a sample of 99 Mexican-origin adults living in California. To test the hypotheses a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA), and post-hoc tests. Dependent variables were assessed using the following measures: Center for Epidemiological Studies Scale (CES-D), the Personality Assessment Inventory Anxiety scale (PAI ANX), Hispanic Stress Inventory (HSI), a modified version of the Perceived Racism Scale for Latina/os (PRSL), 7-item Fear of Deportation (Arbona et al., 2010), and a single question adopted from a survey conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center regarding fear of deportation (2007). The impetus for this study was to examine the psychological implications of immigration and citizenship status and to address a gap in research regarding mental health among undocumented Mexican immigrants. It was hypothesized that: (a) the undocumented Mexican immigrant group would report significantly higher levels of depression and anxiety, relative to the documented Mexican immigrant or U.S. born Mexican American groups, (b) in comparison to the documented immigrant and U.S. born status groups, the undocumented immigrant status group would report significantly higher levels of acculturative and discrimination stress, (c) undocumented and documented Mexican immigrant status groups would report similar levels of fear of deportation, (d) the undocumented immigrant group would report significantly higher levels of immigration stress, relative to the documented immigrant group, (e) and acculturative stress would differentiate between the three immigration and citizenship status groups. Results indicate that with the exception of discrimination and acculturative stress, mental health outcomes and acculturation stressors differed based on immigration and citizenship status among all three status groups. That is, undocumented Mexican immigrants reported significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety, immigration stress, and fear of deportation, than documented Mexican immigrants or U.S. born Mexican Americans. Post hoc analysis revealed that the depression variable was a significant predictor, followed by the acculturative stress variable. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed.

Only a few studies describe psychopathological dimensions in migrants over their nosographic diagnoses; however, there is a growing literature about the greater utility of a categorical-dimensional approach, rather than a solely categorical approach, in the understanding of mental disorders. The aim of this paper is to describe the phenomenology of mental disorders in migrants referred to the Transcultural Psychiatric Team of Bologna (BoTPT), by analysing the psychopathological dimensions that underlie their clinical diagnoses. Methods: We recruited all migrants who attended the BoTPT between May 1999 and July 2009. The psychopathological assessment was conducted with the Association for Methodology and Documentation in Psychiatry (AMDP) and clinical diagnoses were formulated according to ICD-10. We proceeded through a two-step analysis: (1) comparing the prevalence rates of psychopathological symptoms across diagnoses; then (2) conducting a factor analysis to assess how those symptoms configure psychopathological dimensions and how these dimensions underlie clinical diagnoses. Results: As expected, we found significant associations between diagnoses and the prevalence of their core psychopathological symptoms. Factor analysis revealed a strong polymorphism of the psychopathological presentation of mental disorders and unexpectedly showed that in each diagnostic cluster, the first extracted factor was not composed of core symptoms. Conclusions: A mixed categorical-dimensional approach seems to improve the description of the psychopathology among migrants, as it adds relevant information regarding psychopathological dimensions useful to the understanding of the peculiar clinical expressivity of our patients.

In order to address this question, we followed individuals who experienced major changes in social functioning subsequent to the migration to a new country. In this study, 59 new international students were recruited shortly after arrival in the host country and reassessed 2 and 5months later. At each assessment participants provided information on their current social functioning and blood samples for oxytocin and vasopressin analysis. Results indicated that changes in social functioning were not related to changes in plasma oxytocin. Instead, baseline oxytocin predicted changes in social relationship satisfaction, social support, and loneliness over time. In contrast, plasma vasopressin changed as a function of social integration. Baseline vasopressin was not related to changes in social functioning over time. These results emphasize the different roles of plasma oxytocin and vasopressin in responses to changes in social functioning in humans.

Given the particular demands of agricultural labor, however, farmworkers and their partners are highly susceptible to a host of occupation-specific stressors that may result in relationship conflict, and thereafter IPV. In cases where one or both members of the dyad engage in problematic drinking, the likelihood of violence increases exponentially. The purpose of this exploratory quantitative study was to estimate the prevalence of IPV among a mixed gender sample of farmworkers in San Diego County, California, and assess the association of potential correlates (acculturation- and work-related stress, problem drinking, and impulsivity) to IPV. Bilingual interviewers conducted survey data collection by using standardized instruments (e.g., Revised Conflict Tactics Scale; Migrant Farm Work Stress Inventory; AUDIT). Nearly all participants (n = 100) were Mexican born. Results showed that approximately 16% of female individuals (n = 61) and 32% of male individuals (n = 37) reported partner violence perpetration, victimization, or both, in the past year. Significant correlates of IPV were problem drinking (among males) and impulsivity (among females). This study demonstrates the feasibility of conducting IPV research among male and female farmworkers. Additional research is warranted to more fully explore the role of acculturation- and work-related stress, drinking, and other personal characteristics and environmental factors in precipitating couple conflict and thereafter IPV.

Some studies have found, however, that CVD risk increases over time in immigrants and that immigration to a western country is associated with changes in dietary patterns. This could have unfavourable effects on the risk of CVD. There is limited knowledge on the food patterns, awareness and knowledge about healthy nutrition among Chinese immigrants. The objective for this study is to explore changes in food patterns, and levels of awareness and knowledge of healthy nutrition by length of residence among Chinese immigrants to Canada. Methods: 120 Chinese individuals born in China but currently living in Canada completed an assessment on socio-demographic characteristics, changes in dietary patterns and variables of awareness and knowledge about healthy foods. With ordinal logistic regression the associations between the quartiles of length of residence and dietary patterns, variables of awareness and knowledge about healthy foods were explored, adjusting for age, sex, education and body mass index. Results: More than 50% of the participants reported increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables, decreasing the use of deep-frying after immigration. Increased awareness and knowledge about healthy foods was reported by more than 50% of the participants. Ordinal regression indicated that Chinese immigrants who lived in Canada the longest, compared to Chinese immigrants who lived in Canada the shortest, consumed significant greater portion sizes (OR: 9.9; 95% CI: 3.11 - 31.15), dined out more frequently (OR: 15.8; 95% CI: 5.0 - 49.85), and consumed convenience foods more often (OR: 3.5; 95% CI: 1.23 - 10.01). Conclusions: Chinese immigrants reported some favourable changes in their dietary intake and greater awareness and more knowledge about healthy foods after immigration. However, an increase in portion size, an increased frequency of dining out and an increased consumption of convenience foods could indicate some unfavourable changes. These results suggest that health promotion strategies should build on the observed benefits of improved nutritional knowledge and target areas of portion size and convenience eating.

The data collected through this study allowed the researcher to describe foreign-born Latino graduate studentsâ€™ perceptions and the experiences of academic advising practices to specifically identify key elements that would improve academic advising performance and retention and graduation rates at the primary research site. Foreign-born Latinos comprise a strong portion of the workforce population of the U.S. Therefore, there is a need to provide tailored academic advising support to enhance their learning experience. The outcome of this study was also used as supportive information to be included in the Annual Performance Report of the Title V-B PPOHA grant awarded to the institution. Furthermore, the outcome of the study allowed the researcher to identify key elements that could improve the overall academic support systems of other Hispanic-serving institutions around the country. Four research questions guided this study: 1. What kind of academic advising approach is used at the research site? 2. Is the academic advising at the research site helping the acculturation of foreign-born Latino adult learners? 3. Are foreign-born Latino adult learners satisfied with the academic advising approach provided at the research site? 4. What specific changes need to be made to the current academic advising approach to improve its effectiveness? The methodology used was a mixed-methods design. Procedures included an extensive literature review, the examination of instruments, the development of an interview protocol, the surveying of students, and the interviewing of academic advisors. The findings of this study suggested that foreign-born Latino adult learners need personalized attention to guide them through the American higher education system. Therefore, academic advisors of foreign-born Latinos must possess a mentor attitude to maximize the benefits of any academic advising session. Implications for future advising research and practice are included.

This systematic review focuses on differences in conditional risk for PTSD between Latinos and non-Latinos (White, Black, or combined) and across Latino subgroups in studies that adjust for trauma exposure. We discuss methodological characteristics of existing articles and sociocultural explanatory factors. Electronic bibliographic searches were conducted for English-language articles published in peer-reviewed journals between 1991 and 2012. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Twenty-eight articles met inclusion criteria. Consistent support was found for elevated rates of PTSD onset and PTSD severity among Latinos relative to non-Latino Whites. The evidence on racial/ethnic differences in conditional risk for PTSD prevalence and PTSD persistence is mixed. Twenty-four articles evaluated sociocultural explanations, with the strongest support found for racial/ethnic variation in peri-traumatic responses and structure of PTSD. There were also consistent main effects for social disadvantage in studies that simultaneously adjusted for effects of race/ethnicity. Future research should use theoretically-driven models to formally test for interactions between sociocultural factors, race/ethnicity, and PTSD probability.

Particularly in later life, when individuals face declining health and increasing dependency, patterns of attachment may relate to affective outcomes. However, few studies have empirically examined the attachmentâ€“well-being link at the end of the life span or considered whether ethnic group membership may moderate attachmentâ€“well-being links. Data from a sample of older adults (N = 1,116) were used to investigate how secure, dismissive, and fearful/avoidant styles predicted well-being in 4 ethnic groups; African Americans, European Americans, Eastern European immigrants, and English-speaking Caribbean immigrants. As expected, both secure and dismissive attachment dimensions were related to greater well-being, whereas fearful/avoidant attachment was associated with less. This positive impact of a secure attachment style of relating to others on well-being was stronger among African Americans and English-speaking Caribbeans compared with the European American and Eastern European immigrant groups. The negative impact of a fearful/avoidant attachment style of relating on well-being was buffered by being an English-speaking Caribbean but not for the other 3 groups. Results are interpreted in light of general and culture-specific premises of attachment. The article concludes with some implications and suggestions for future work.

There is evidence of ethnic inequalities in health and access to and use of healthcare but insufficient consideration of the importance of birth abroad and length of residence in the UK. This study examines indicators of health status, behaviour and healthcare use among mothers of infants in the Millennium Cohort Study, according to whether born in the UK or abroad, individual ethnic grouping, and length of residence. Our findings show there are both positive and negative health indicators associated with ethnicity, birth abroad, and length of residence and presenting results on a single factor in isolation could lead to a misinterpretation of associations. For mothers ethnicity has an important relationship with most health indicators independent of country of birth, length of residence and socio-demographic circumstances. Once adjusted for ethnicity and socio-demographic variables, association with birth abroad disappears for most health outcomes suggesting that there may not be an independent migrant penalty in health. There is a linear trend in decreasing health status with increasing length of residence but no independent association between length of residence and healthcare use. This suggests that while there are continuing barriers to good health for migrants in the receiving society as shown in other studies, factors important for one health outcome may not apply to another. Our findings challenge linear acculturation models for migrantsâ€™ health in showing that a linear trend in improving socio-economic circumstances for mothers in some ethnic groups is not always associated with better health outcomes or changes in health behaviour. Our results point to a need for a comprehensive collection of information and analysis for all categories of migrants for understanding patterns of and factors underlying health and use of healthcare.

However, forensic measures are rarely based on normative samples that represent the considerable diversity present in forensic settings. The paucity of this research is particularly evident for psychologists asked to assess asylum seekers, where issues relating to diversity are central. The present study represents one of the first efforts to investigate the validity of measures of feigning, that have potential utility in asylum evaluations, in a non-Western sample. The study evaluated four measures that are commonly used to detect feigned psychiatric symptoms and insufficient cognitive effort, including the Dot Counting Test (DCT), the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM), the Miller Forensic Assessment of Symptoms Test (M-FAST) and the Atypical Response (ATR) scale on the Traumatic Symptoms Inventory, Second Edition. The study compared performance on these measures among three groups of West and Central African immigrants: honest participants with PTSD, honest participants without PTSD, and participants without PTSD asked to feign symptoms of distress. The data were used to evaluate the ability of these individuals to feign PTSD, to assess the classification accuracy of each measure, and to assess the effect of demographic variables and acculturation on these measures. When possible, the data were also used to derive alternative cutoffs scores that resulted in higher levels of classification accuracy than those previously established. Notably, individuals demonstrated difficulty feigning symptoms of distress. Using both published and optimized cutoff scores, no measure demonstrated high rates of both sensitivity and specificity, although the TOMM, M-FAST and ATR scale displayed valuable, but limited utility. The combined use of TOMM and M-FAST provided the highest rates of classification accuracy. No measures were affected by acculturation, as measured in the study, although the DCT was significantly correlated to years of education. The results emphasize the need for future research in this area.

Recent immigration has resulted in an increasingly large number of residents in Canada and the US who represent both an immigrant and an ethnic minority status. Among such residents are Chinese immigrants. Because of the potentially large number of school-age children who are part of these families, the family functioning of the new Chinese immigrants with school-age children would be important for the childrenâ€™s development. This study therefore compared 112 Chinese families who recently immigrated to Canada with 90 Caucasian non-immigrant families. Scales were administered to the families to measure various aspects of family functioning. The results showed that the Chinese immigrants experienced a lower degree of family cohesion. Their socio-ecological factors were both similar and different from the non-immigrants, with a lower degree of social support and certain differences in child-rearing practices than the non-immigrants. Social support and child-rearing practices were differentially related to different dimensions of family functioning. However, these relationships were not entirely unique to the immigrants. The results have increased our understanding of immigrants and may contribute to the provision of effective support for immigrants. Implications are suggested for community support for immigrants and for further research.

We regard citizenship as a state regulated technique of in- and exclusion and a crucial instrument in the management of populations. Taking the Dutch contexts of immigration and integration as our case, we argue that cultural assimilationism and neo-liberalism appear in a double helix: they combine to form a new governmental strategy we call neo-liberal communitarianism. Neo-liberal communitarianism is the underlying rationale of a population management that operates both in an individualizing (citizenship as individual participation and responsibility) and a de-individualizing way ('community' at various aggregate and localized levels as frame of 'integration'). It thus combines a communitarian care of a Dutch culturally grounded national communityâ€”conceived as traditionally 'enlightened' and 'liberal'â€”with a neo-liberal emphasis on the individual's responsibility to achieve membership of that community. 'Community' is thereby selectively seen as mobilized and present (when immigrant integration is concerned) or as latently present and still in need of mobilization (when indigenous Dutch are concerned). Concomitantly, a repressive responsibilization and a facilitative responsibilization are aimed at these two governmentally differentiated populations.

Method: Personal interviews were held with 3906 veteran Israelis, 845 immigrants from the former Soviet Union (FSU) and 107 immigrants from other countries (all the immigrants immigrated after 1989). Psychological distress was measured on the General Health Questionnaire-12. Results: Psychological distress among FSU immigrants was significantly higher than among veteran Israelis and immigrants from elsewhere. FSU immigrants were almost twice as likely to report severe psychological distress. Factors associated with psychological distress were female gender, age above 50, being divorced/widowed, being secular, having higher education and being either unemployed or 'not in workforce'. Conclusion: The results support the acculturation stress hypothesis as an explanation for psychological distress in immigrants only in immigrants from the FSU, indicating that policymakers should plan services and prevention programmes differentially for different immigrant populations.

Often, the focus of epidemiological studies was on symptomatology, rather than on clinical diagnoses, and different Hispanic subgroups were infrequently distinguished in analyses. Such strategies led to ambiguity in the interpretation of results. Since mood symptom measures typically detect general psychological distress in addition to diagnosable mood disorders, recent immigrants and members of underprivileged minority groups might be expected to show elevated scores on symptom measures even without any history of psychiatric disorder. In addition, the lack of subgroup analyses obscured potentially important differences between those originating from very different cultural backgrounds and subjected to very different migratory pressures and influences. Even with the advent of more comprehensive epidemiological research using standardized diagnostic interviews, data were not necessarily collected in Spanish. For example, the National Comorbidity Study (NCS) included a sample of 719 US Hispanic participants, surveyed only in English. This led to a restriction of range on important variables linked to language proficiency, such as acculturation and for some Hispanic subgroups, socioeconomic status. Not surprisingly, results of this study were quite different than those of other epidemiological work, indicating that Hispanics were twice as likely as African Americans to report current depression.

Design: A convenience sample of 200 self-identified Chinese and Koreans, aged 65 years and older, were interviewed. Psychometric analysis was conducted to examine the reliability and validity of a new social support measure. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to examine the relationship between social support and psychological well-being. Results: Factor analysis revealed a four-factor solution of social support and adequate psychometrics of all social support scales was found. Multivariate results suggest that Koreans have more depression than Chinese (p < 0.01). Those who lived with their spouse and adult children had lower overall psychological well-being (p < 0.05) and lower positive affect (p < 0.05) compared to those who lived alone. Having more emotional/companionship support significantly (p < 0.001) contributed to better overall psychological well-being, having less depression and higher positive affect. Conclusions: A new multidimensional social support measure for use with older Chinese and Koreans could be useful upon further validation. These results suggest that older Chinese and Koreans' psychological well-being may be negatively affected when they live with their adult children. More depression in Koreans may be related to difficulties in expanding their social network beyond Korean-speaking people.

Through the use of cultural priming methodologies, investigators have demonstrated that biculturals, or individuals who have experienced and identify with more than one culture, can switch between various 'cultural frames of reference' in response to corresponding social cues (Hong, Morris, Chiu, & Benet-Martinez, 2000). Drawing on this work on the cognitive implications of biculturalism, the purpose of the present study was to examine the assumption that independent and interdependent self-construals are associated with the motivational standards of self-enhancement and self-criticism, respectively. More specifically, the effects of differential primes of self on ratings of self-enhancement were investigated in a sample of bicultural Asian American (N = 42) and Anglo American (N = 60) college students; overall, more similarities than differences were noted between the two groups. It was hypothesized that Anglo American students would display marked tendencies toward self-enhancement. However, this hypothesis was not supported. Nevertheless, consistent prime effects were observed for a selected number of ratings related to academic virtues, with those who received an independent-self prime often exhibiting greater self-enhancing tendencies than those who received an interdependent-self prime. For example, participants in the independent-self condition reported on average significantly higher ratings for self-discipline and initiative, as well as the degree to which they perceived themselves to be hard working. Implications for the work on self-representations, motivation, and acculturation are discussed.

Based on the theory of cultural values by Schwartz, it was tested whether cross-country differences in cultural value preferences can explain individual differences in negative group-related attitudes. Furthermore, the present article postulates that individuals with a migration background are less strongly guided by the cultural values of the society in which they live, because they are additionally exposed to cultural values originating from their heritage culture. Samples from 24 countries that were part of the fourth wave of the European Social Survey were examined. Cultural values were assessed using the Portrait Value Questionnaire. Group-related attitudes were operationalized through an index of attitudes toward four different groups. Analyses of hierarchical linear models supported the hypotheses: Participantsâ€™ degree of negative group-related attitudes varied as a function of the cultural values inherent in the individualsâ€™ countries. Moreover, weaker effects were found for individuals with migration background compared to individuals without migration background, especially for first-generation immigrants and immigrants from culturally more distant countries. Moreover, country-level cultural values were found to moderate the relationship of individual education and income level with group-related attitudes. Results are discussed with regard to their contribution to the literature on acculturation and with regard to the validity of Schwartzâ€™s cultural value theory.

Whereas Alzheimerâ€™s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are common conditions in this population of frail older adults, little is known about the beliefs of foreign home care workers about ADRD or about their practices. Methods: A mixed-methods design was conducted in 2006â€“2007 in Israel. The study included a survey of beliefs about ADRD completed by 184 Filipino home care workers and qualitative interviews with 29 Filipino home care workers. Results: On seven of the 14 belief items, more than 30% of the workers were in discordance with scientific view about ADRD. Those workers who were not informed about the care recipientâ€™s medical conditions were more likely to report beliefs that were inconsistent with current scientific knowledge. In qualitative interviews, Filipino home care workers reported using intuitively behavioral techniques when caring for older adults with ADRD. Conclusions: Despite the fact that some of the workersâ€™ beliefs are inconsistent with current scientific view, their actual intuitive practices are consistent with the scientific paradigm. Specific emphasis has to be placed on encouraging workersâ€™ intuitive approach to ADRD and providing workers with ample information about the medical conditions and needs of the care recipient.

We compared 79 elderly Asian immigrants, most of whom immigrated from China or Hong Kong, with 58 elders who were not Asian and mostly not immigrants. Responding to hypothetical situations presented on a self-administered questionnaire, the Asian group professed to be more likely to be influenced by a request from a son/daughter, landlord, physician, or advertisement (p < 0.001) and by a monetary incentive (p = 0.05). Multivariate adjustment for potential confounders attenuated the strength of these relations, but except in the case of the monetary offer, differences remained statistically significant. Within the Asian group, multivariate logistic regression modeling indicated that years lived in the US was associated with more likelihood of refusing requests to participate in research.

Ss from 7 immigrant groups (Russians, Ingrian/Finnish returnees, Estonians, Somalis, Arabs, Vietnamese and Turks), answered a mailed questionnaire based on traditional acculturation research as well as victim research. Discrimination experiences were highly predictive of the psychological well-being of all immigrants, as well as of lack of trust in the Finnish authorities. Contrary to hypotheses regarding the effects of visibility and cultural proximity, group differences in psychological distress did not correspond to the group differences observed in perceived discrimination. Results are discussed in terms of the opposing predictions concerning self-damage effects of discrimination, made by social identity theory and the theory on self-protecting functions of external attributions (J.

The well-being of older persons, including immigrant elders, has been linked to homeownership, in part because ownership imparts many advantages not available to nonowners. This study investigated homeownership among older Mexican Americans with a conceptual model based on economic, assimilation, social capital, and place stratification perspectives. Data from the 2000 U.S. census were employed to examine individual and contextual effects using multilevel models. The authors found support for several hypotheses drawn from their conceptual framework. The authors also showed that both citizenship status of target individuals and citizenship makeup of households were associated with the likelihood of homeownership.

We examined the co-occurrence of anxiety and depression with prevalent physical chronic illnesses in a representative sample of Latinos with national origins from Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and other Latin American countries. Method: We used data on 2,554 Latinos (75.5% response rate) ages 18 years and older from the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS). The NLAAS was based on a stratified area probability sample design, and the sample came from the 50 states and Washington, DC. Survey questionnaires were delivered both in person and over the telephone in English and Spanish. Psychiatric disorders were assessed using the World Mental Health Survey Initiative version of the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI). Physical chronic illness was assessed by self-reported history. Results: Puerto Ricans had the highest prevalence of meeting criteria for any comorbid psychiatric disorder (more than one disorder). Puerto Ricans had the highest prevalence (22%) of subject-reported asthma history, while Cubans had the highest prevalence (33%) of cardiovascular disease. After accounting for age, sex, household income, number of years in the US, immigrant status, and anxiety or depression, anxiety was associated with diabetes and cardiovascular disease, in the entire sample. Depression and co-occurring anxiety and depression were positively associated with having a history of asthma but not with other physical diseases, in the entire sample. Interestingly, Puerto Ricans with a depressive disorder had a lower odds of having a history of cardiovascular disease than Puerto Ricans without a depressive disorder. The relationship between chronic physical and mental illness was not confounded by immigration status or number of years in the US. Discussion: Despite previous findings that link acculturation with both chronic physical and mental illness, this study does not find that number of years in the US nor nativity explain the prevalence of psychiatric-medical comorbidities. This study demonstrates the importance of considering psychiatric and medical comorbidity among specific ethnic groups, as different patterns emerge than when using aggregate ethnic measures. Research is needed on both the pathways and the mechanisms of comorbidity for the specific Latino groups.

He points out that although valuable new constructs were added over time in the research on black identity, the same method (self-report questionnaires) typically continued to be used to assess them. Multiple ethnic identities and situational and developmental changes in identity are clearly important, and so a true mixing of methods is needed to understand identity (considered as cognitions, feelings, and behavior) across contexts.

A review of the literature revealed that ethnic minorities tend to score higher on certain scales of the MMPI and MCMI compared to their White counterparts. The literature also indicated that acculturation level can serve as a moderator variable on overall performance on these measures. Most of the studies that examined racial/ethnic differences on the MCMI were conducted using the MCMI-I and MCMI-II. While many MCMI studies have explored racial differences, few studies have examined the impact of cultural factors on MCMI-III performance. To date, there is no empirical data on the impact of culture on the MCMI-III scores of Blacks from different cultural backgrounds. Given the significant increase in the number of Black immigrants to the United States especially from the Caribbean and Africa, Black Americans are becoming an even more diverse group, representing different cultures and nationalities. In the current study, the performance of African Americans (n = 52) and Caribbean Blacks (n = 77) were compared on the Antisocial, Narcissistic, Paranoid, and Delusional Disorder scales of the MCMI-III. Attempts were also made to compare Blacks in the current sample to the MCMI-IIIâ€™s development sample. Additionally, the impact of cultural variables was examined using the African American Acculturation Scaled-Revised (AAAS-R). Multivariate Analysis of Variance procedure revealed no significant difference in performance between the two groups on the select scales of the MCMI-III (p =.883). Additional analyses revealed significant difference between the two groups on the Compulsive scale: Caribbean Blacks obtained a higher mean (Cohenâ€™s d =.-50. F = 6.663, p = .011). Analyses comparing the Blacks in the current sample to the MCMI-IIIâ€™s development sample indicated the following: (a) a significant difference between the two groups on the Antisocial, Narcissistic, and Delusional Disorder Scales and (b) no significant difference between the two groups on the Paranoid scale (p = .559). Supplemental analysis revealed moderate association between the Paranoid and Delusional Disorder Scales of the MCMI-III and certain scales of the AAAS-R, implying both a degree of item overlap and similar item content.

Marcus","The relationship between perceived social status, stress, and health in Mexican American immigrants",1,NA,"The current paper examines the relationship between social support, perceived social status and health in the context of the Hispanic Paradox. It was hypothesized that social support will predict perceived social status which, in turn, is an important factor in predicting physical health among Mexican immigrants. The current paper also hypothesized that stress mediates the relationship between perceived social status and health. Three hundred and twenty male and female Mexican immigrants (ages 18-79) completed questionnaires, wore ambulatory blood pressure monitors for 24 hours, and submitted blood samples. Results supported some, but not most hypotheses. Greater social support was related to higher perceived social status ( p = 0.01) and stress mediated two indirect relationships between perceived social status and health outcomes. Specifically, as perceived social status increased calories consumed decreased (p = 0.01) and self-reported health improved (p = 0.02). Still, there were no direct relationships between perceived social status and health outcomes and only two stress mediated relationships. Implications of the results and future directions are addressed. The paper discusses the possibility that higher education and possible variations in degree of acculturation among study participants might have resulted in a unique relationship between perceived social status and health. The paper also addresses the role that a high LDS affiliation among participants might play in the relationship between perceived social status and health of Hispanic immigrants. Finally, the relationship between perceived social status and self-reported health as the study's most consistent finding is discussed.

In this case study I investigated the first language maintenance and attrition of three young adults who had immigrated to Canada as children from mainland China and Taiwan. Two questions were addressed: (a) What linguistic elements were maintained and eroded in the participants' heritage language? and (b) What social and psychological factors contributed to the participants' L1 maintenance and attrition? The data were collected through self-evaluation questionnaires, translation tasks and open-ended interviews both in English and Mandarin. Using a combination of life stories describing the participants' personal linguistic and social experiences in Canada and the results of linguistic assessments through different tasks, the study provides a detailed examination of the phenomenon of L1 maintenance and attrition among young adult immigrants from China. The findings of this study indicate that the three participants took distinct routes resulting in differential outcomes in their first language maintenance and attrition. Ethnic and cultural identity, and language attitudes and beliefs were identified as important internal factors. School discourse including teachers' attitudes towards immigrants' L1, peer influences and access to planned L1 educational activities both at home and in the school system were important external factors affecting the participants' L1 maintenance and attrition. The results provide support for the view that a collaborative, inclusive approach to education that involves not only immigrant students, but also their families, educational systems, and society in general facilitates young immigrants' bilingualism and acculturation.

Perceived risk is a predictor for adopting risk-reducing behaviors. Despite the rising incidence of type 2 diabetes in Korean immigrants and their increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) associated with diabetes, little is known about the level of CHD risk perception and risk factor control in this group. Purpose. (1) Describe the level of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk perception and risk factors; (2) examine factors associated with CHD risk perception; (3) describe glucose control status; and (4) examine determinants of glucose control in Korean immigrants with type 2 diabetes. Methods. A cross-sectional descriptive study design was used. Data were collected from a community sample of 143 Korean adults with type 2 diabetes, aged 30 to 80 years old. Participants completed questionnaires and submitted to a finger stick blood test for glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), cholesterol panel, and anthropometric measures. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to evaluate factors influencing CHD risk perception and glucose control in Korean immigrants with type 2 diabetes. Findings. Perception of CHD risk among participants was low. Most (76.9%) perceived their risk to be the same or lower than their peers in the general population. According to American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines, CHD risk-factor control was suboptimal. More than half had uncontrolled blood pressure and higher low density lipoprotein cholesterol (55% and 53.6% respectively) than the target goal. CHD knowledge had a significant positive effect and self-reported general health had a significant negative effect on the perception of CHD risk. The mean HbA1c level was 7.6 % (SD = 1.5; range = 5.6 to 12.5). Less than half of the participants (41.3%) met the ADA's goal of less than 7%. Roughly 22% of variance in HbA1c levels was explained by a linear combination of family diet support, acculturation, body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), the duration of diabetes, the number of diabetic medications, age, gender, and education (R2 = 0.223, F[9,133] = 4.24; p < .0001). In the final model, family diet support, age, WHR, the duration of diabetes, and the number of diabetic medications determined glucose control.

Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with depressive symptoms based on a score of â‰¥21 on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale. Lower household income, interference of diabetes with daily activities, and more T2D clinical symptoms were associated with depression risk in the multivariate analyses. At each level of food insecurity the risk of depression was lower the higher the level of social support (P < 0.05). Findings suggest that social support buffers against the negative influence of household food insecurity on depression risk.

The migrant pathway from Australasia to the UK is well established. Moreover, rugby league is a sport in which debate concerning the merits of employing labour migrants from Australasia is prevalent and ongoing. The study used interview and questionnaire data to investigate the embodied experiences facing this group of migrant professionals. Migrant experiences prior to migrating were contoured by access to resources and by the formal and informal relationships developed through professional and personal careers. The embodied and complex nature of contractual negotiations is highlighted. The centrality of embodied migrant identity and habitus is noted in relation to acculturation strategies adopted over time and space, both prior to and during a foreign sojourn, in terms of established and outsider groups. The paper also highlights how subgroups within a more general group of labour migrants can emerge. Furthermore, the complex influence of personal and professional relationships was found to be both enabling and constraining. These differences between subgroups are considered in light of previous work on acculturation strategies and the existential nature of migration.

In Western countries, women usually make more demands, whereas men are more likely to withdraw. But the recently advanced marital structure hypothesis suggests that this pattern can be altered by gender roles and beliefs, particularly in traditional marriages. To test such hypotheses, the authors conducted an observational study of marital communication across very different cultures, with varying levels of patriarchy (i.e., 50 White American couples, 52 Pakistani couples in Pakistan, and 48 immigrant Pakistani couples in America). Across cultures, demand-withdraw communication was related to marital distress, extending previous findings to new groups. However, the findings challenge the notion that demanding and withdrawing behaviors are inherently male or female; rather, the results point to the relevance of contextual factors, specifically gender power differences and acculturation, in understanding the demand-withdraw marital interaction pattern. Therapists working with foreign or immigrant couples must consider the cross-cultural generalizability of existing theories of marital communication.

Hwa-Byung develops when the emotions of anger have been suppressed for a long period of time and it becomes difficult to control those feelings. Common complaints of Hwa-Byung have two dimensions, psychological and physical symptoms. The prevalence of Hwa-Byung exhibits gender differences in that the majority of individuals who experience Hwa-Byung are women between the ages of 40 and 60. However, as the number of Korean immigrants in the United States continues to increase and their issues draw attention from researchers, the topic of Hwa-Byung receives little. Because Korean immigrants in the United States share a cultural background with their origin of ethnicity, and at the same time, may also assimilate the American culture during the acculturation process, this study will address the cultural differences in Hwa-Byung between native Koreans who live in South Korea and Korean immigrants in the United States. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to examine the differences and similarities of Hwa-Byung in native Korean middle-aged women in South Korea and Korean immigrants in the United States, roughly between the age range of late-30's to middle 60's, by investigating the influencing factors of stressful life events, stress response, anger expression, and demographic background. A sample size of at least 200 participants, required for each group, using both paper-pencil and web-based methods, depended on participants' preferences, which were influenced by a gap in ages and the level of familiarity with and/or ability to access Internet. Participants were randomly selected from major cities, both in South Korea (including Seoul, Incheon, Busan, Daejeon, and Gyeonggi Province) and the United States (including Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles), using similar proportions of ages for both groups for the equivalences of participants in cross-cultural research. Survey measures included five instruments: (a) the Hwa-Byung scale (Kwon, Kim, Park, Lee, Min, & Kwon, 2008); (b) Life Stress for Korean women (Chon & Kim, 2003); (c) stress response inventory (SRI) (Koh, Park, & Kim, 2000); (d) anger expression (Hahn, Chon, Lee, & Spielberger, 1997), and (e) demographic background that measured the variables used in this study. To minimize the weakness of language differences used in the different cultural contexts, survey packages for Korean immigrant participants in the United States were formatted in both Korean and English for each item. Thus, a translation process became necessary, especially for the Korean instruments of the Hwa-Byung Scale, Life Stress for Korean women and Stress Response Inventory (SRI), from Korean into Englishtwo of which were (originally developed by Korean researchers) . On the other hand, native Koreans submitted only the Korean version of questionnaires because they fully understood the meaning of questionnaire statements, as well as in order to get rid of possible distractions by the inclusion of English sentences.

Yet, the cross-national mobility of individuals has increased heterogeneity within country markets. The purpose of this study is to examine how immigrant consumers perceive advertising appeals in the context of the consumer acculturation process. Specifically, our study focusses on the reactions of Mexican, American, and Mexican-American consumers to puffery-laden advertisements. Design/methodology/approach: Using two-factor theory as our theoretical prism, the study offers salient hypotheses regarding consumer perceptions of puffery-laden advertising appeals, which are then tested in a cross-national experiment in the USA and Mexico. Findings: The results show that Mexican consumers are more susceptible to puffery-laden claims than Americans. In contrast, American consumers are more susceptible to advertising that does not contain puffery-laden claims than their Mexican counterparts. Interestingly, the findings also reveal that Mexican immigrants are highly susceptible to both, puffery-laden and no puffery appeals. The mixed results show that recent Mexican immigrants struggle as they transition to the dominant American consumer culture. First and second generations of Mexican-Americans, however, react to puffery-laden advertisements just as typical American consumers. Practical implications: The paper discusses relevant implications not only for the study of puffery and acculturation of immigrant minority groups, but also for companies engaged in global advertising campaigns in countries with diverse immigrant communities. Originality/value: The paper offers a worthwhile and unique examination of consumer acculturation in an international cross-cultural setting and puts forward interesting insights regarding the application of international advertising strategies.

Aim: The primary aim of the study is to empirically derive the factorial structure of the VDS to support its use as a culturally responsive depression screening tool in community samples of Vietnamese adults. Method: The factorial structure, reliability, and associations of the VDS factors with recognized socio-demographic correlates were examined using data collected from interviews with a non-probability community sample of 180 Vietnamese refugee adults in the Houston area. Results: The empirically derived factorial structure of the VDS approximated the theorized conceptualization of depression introduced by the scale’s originators. Three factors (depressed affect, somatic symptoms, and cultural-specific symptoms) accounted for 65% of the variance. As hypothesized, the VDS factors correlated with age and acculturation variables. Conclusion: Overall results suggest that the conceptualization of depression among this sample of Vietnamese refugees has both universal and culturally specific features. Implications for providing culturally responsive mental health services are offered.

This cross-sectional observational study examined one such exception, the 'Latino paradox' by investigating the presence of a Latino advantage in oral health-related quality of life and the effect of nativity status on this relationship. A nationally representative sample of adults (n = 4208) completed the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2004. The impact of oral disorders on oral health-related quality of life was evaluated using the NHANES Oral Health Impact Profile. Exposures of interest were race, ethnicity and nativity status. Covariates included sociodemographic characteristics, smoking status, self-rated health, access to dental care and number of teeth. Unconditional logistic regression models estimated odds of impaired oral health-related quality of life for racial/ethnic and nativity groups compared to the Non-Latino white population. Overall, prevalence of impaired oral health-related quality of life was 15.1%. A protective effect of Latino ethnicity was modified by nativity status, such that Latino immigrants experienced substantially better outcomes than non-Latino whites. However, the effect was limited to first-generation Latinos. U.S. born Latinos did not share the oral health-related quality of life advantage of their foreign-born counterparts. This advantage was not attributable to the healthy migrant phenomenon since immigrants of non-Latino origin did not differ from Non-Latino whites. The excess risk among Non-Hispanic Blacks was rendered non-significant after adjustment for socioeconomic position. A protective effect conferred by Latino nativity is unexpected given relatively disadvantaged socioeconomic position of this group, their language barrier and restrictions to needed dental care. As the Latino advantage in oral health-related quality of life is not explained by healthy immigrant selection, cultural explanations seem more likely than explanations based on characteristics of individuals.

In particular, the economic struggles facing many newcomer families may pose significant risk to Latina adolescents’ well-being, given their increasing roles and responsibilities within the family. Given the rapid increase in Latina youth arriving in the United States in recent years, more research is needed to better understand the impact of multiple risk factors on their psychological and behavioral health. To address this gap, this study used a mixed-methods approach to explore the contribution of four common challenges (economic difficulties, discrimination, language difficulties, and community violence) on 122 Latina adolescent newcomers’ internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Results demonstrated that, indeed, economic challenges pose the widest ranging risk, in predicting internalizing symptoms. Whereas language difficulties predicted internalizing symptoms, discrimination and community violence were unrelated to psychological outcomes. Qualitative interviews with 15 newcomer Latinas explored more deeply the complexities of economic and language difficulties faced. By taking a mixed-methods and community-based approach, this study deepens our knowledge of a growing, highly vulnerable, and little-studied population. Economic and language challenges can create significant adjustment problems. It is therefore critical that service providers and school officials consider these challenges when working with newcomer immigrants, especially with Latina adolescent newcomers. This research is an important step toward developing community and school level policies and programs to improve social justice by fostering the successful adjustment of Latina newcomer adolescents.

A theoretical model of psychological disharmony is outlined, where hard work and thrift become the crucial elements of immigrant condition. Three studies are reported. Studies 1 and 2 were conducted among Polish immigrants in Ireland. These studies addressed personality comparisons between immigrants and nonimmigrant samples (Study 1: peer observations) and immigrant self-perceived changes (Study 2). Adaptive personality changes did occur as hypothesized, particularly in the domain of conscientiousness, which regulates work-related activities. This finding was restricted in Study 2 to a prospective time frame (change measured with time flow). Study 2 introduced four lifestyles: eudaimonia, hedonism, self-sacrifice, and alienation. Prospective change in conscientiousness favored eudaimonic lifestyle, but retrospective change predicted self-sacrifice. Participants in Study 3 were Eastern Slav and Vietnamese immigrants in Poland. Based on previous work on Confucian work dynamism, it was expected that Vietnamese would demonstrate greater work involvement, eudaimonic lifestyle, and thrift, compared to Slav immigrants. These hypotheses were confirmed, showing that within the general model of immigrant adaptation, there is room for cultural differences.

Aims: To investigate the correlation between acculturation and psychotic symptomatology in a group of immigrants suffering from psychosis and to explore differences in demographic factors related with the acculturation process between individuals with and without psychosis. Methods: Sixty-five patients and 317 non-psychotic immigrants were interviewed using the Immigrant Acculturation Scale (IAS) and a structured questionnaire for demographic data. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) and the Glοbal Assessment of Functioning (GAF) were also administered to all immigrants suffering from psychosis. Results: Total IAS scores, as well as IAS everyday life scores, were positively correlated with GAF scores. IAS everyday life score in the patient group related with religion, marital status, gender and years in Greece, while in the non-psychosis group it was related with gender and years in Greece. IAS wishful orientation/nostos (the strong desire for one’s homeland) related with religion in both groups. The IAS identity in the psychosis group did not show any significant relation with any of the variables, while in the non-patient group, it was related with marital status, gender and years in Greece. Age, duration of residence in Greece and higher adoption of Greek ethnic identity were the variables that differentiated the two groups of immigrants. Conclusion: Acculturation in immigrants suffering from psychosis could be seen as a process that does not correlate strongly with the severity of the symptomatology but is probably influenced by different set of factors.

In the original article, the wrong authorship of a cited source was listed. The correct reference is given in this erratum.] Acculturation refers to changes that result from intercultural contact. Although it is commonly defined as a two-way process with changes occurring among both minority members and majority members, surprisingly little research has focused on the acculturation of majority members. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative data, the present study attempted to fill this gap by exploring how and how much majority members change because of exposure to immigrant cultures. In the first part, using an open-response format, majority members reported positive as well as negative cultural change across a broad range of life domains. Most changes were reported in the private as compared to public sphere, and in terms of behaviours rather than values. Second, based on their responses to quantitative acculturation scales, the majority-group participants could meaningfully be clustered into three acculturation strategies commonly used to describe minority-group members’ acculturation, namely a separation, integration and undifferentiated acculturation cluster. No evidence for an assimilation cluster was found. Separated majority members (i.e., who maintain their majority culture but do not adopt immigrant cultures) reported significantly more identity threat and perceived ethnic discrimination, but also higher self-esteem. Interestingly, integrated majority members (i.e., who both maintain their majority culture and adopt immigrant cultures) were three times less likely to live in multi-ethnic neighbourhoods as compared to separated participants. The results of this study offer important insights into majority members’ acculturation experiences and their psychological importance. Implications for culturally plural societies and future research are discussed.

Dietary patterns were measured using the Block Brief Food Questionnaire (BFQ), total foods and beverages consumed over the past year, as specified in BBFQ, were studied. Two hundred seven (N = 207) Iranian American immigrants completed the acculturation, food frequency and socio-demographic questionnaires. All participants were born in Iran, were 18 years of age or older and had lived more than one year in the U.S. About 37.5% of participants had acculturation scores indicating Iranian values; the majority (62.5%) had either adapted American values (26.5%) or had combined some American values (36%). Results indicate age at arrival, length of stay, English fluency, education and income are major factors determining level of acculturation, dietary patterns and prevalence of chronic diseases among Iranian American immigrants. Consumption of Western diet and level of acculturation was less among participants who lived longer (> 10 years) in the U.S. and were older when they arrived to the US. The rate of family history of diabetes among participants was 39.1%., though 9% had pre-diabetes and 4% reported being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. A majority of the participants (87%) reported no secondary health concerns related to dietary intake. As Iranian American immigrants grow older their consumption of red meats, fast foods, soft drinks, potatoes, salty snacks, refined grains and sweets were significantly decreased and they consumed more vegetables. Given growing Iranian immigrants in U.S., a deep understanding of factors influencing dietary patterns of Iranian immigrates is necessary. Our study with small sample size (207) has several limitations, which should be rectified by future researchers. Therefore, conclusion about association between level of acculturation, dietary patterns and prevalence of chronic diseases among participants is limited. New Iranian immigrants especially those with school-aged children may become more aware of consumption of Western diet and ill effects on their overall wellbeing.

The purpose of this paper is to contextualize the study of acculturation and adjustment by taking an ecological approach to exploring these relationships across several life domains, using a bilinear scale, and examining mediators of these relationships for adult Vietnamese refugees (N = 203) in the United States. We call this approach the Ecological Acculturation Framework (EAF). Results of a structural equation model (SEM) showed that job satisfaction fully mediated the relationship between American acculturation and psychological distress, demonstrating that this relationship was specific to an occupational domain. However, while Vietnamese acculturation predicted co-ethnic social support satisfaction, it did not predict reduced psychological distress. Implications for a life domains approach, including domain specificity, are discussed.

Method(s): A cross-sectional study was conducted in Queensland, Australia. A total of 382 first-generation young adult (aged 20–39 years) ME migrants completed a self-administered questionnaire. The hypothesised model was tested through a two-step process: measurement, and structural model testing. First, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was applied to test the fit of the measurement model and reliability and validity indices were calculated. Structural Equations Modelling (SEM) was then used to test the structural model. The significance of the mediating effect was tested using bootstrapping method. Results: Mainstream acculturation had the greatest accumulated total effect on PWB through both a direct and an indirect effect via perceived discrimination. Ethnic acculturation had the second greatest total effect on PWB, with both a direct effect and indirect effects through perceived social support and perceived discrimination. Perceived discrimination demonstrated both a direct effect and an indirect effect on PWB through perceived social support. Perceived social support had only a direct effect on PWB. Conclusions: Facilitating ME migrants’ active participation in both ethnic and mainstream societies is important. Moreover, developing ethnic communities associations and resources could be an effective option to provide social support to ME migrants and in turn to improve their PWB. To provide ME migrants with better mental health outcomes, there is still a need to minimize the discrimination against them.

A total of 120 participants representing three different generational groups (1st, 1.5, 2nd) varying in age, socioeconomic status, and educational level were recruited from the local Korean immigrant population. Participants were seen individually in their homes and instructions and measures were given in the language of the subject's choice (Korean or English). Measures included the Korean Acculturation Scale (KAS), composed of 32-item Acculturation and 8-item Biculturality subscales, a 52-item Relational Family Values Q-Sort (RFVQ), and a 14-item demographic questionnaire. Results indicated that the Korean Acculturation Scale (KAS) had excellent internal consistency and test-retest reliability over a two-week interval. KAS Acculturation and Biculturality Subscale scores were generally found to relate in the expected direction to demographic variables. The RFVQ Q-factor analysis replicated the two-factor solution found by Sung and Wozniak (1999); and on the basis of patterns of factor loadings, three participant groups were identified. (a) Group 1 included those loading positively and significantly only on the Acculturated Korean Family Values factor; (b) Group 2 consisted of those loading positively and significantly on the Traditional Korean Family Values factor and variously on the Acculturated Korean Family Values factor; and (c) Group 3 was composed of those loading positively and significantly on the Acculturated Korean Family Values factor and negatively and significantly on the Traditional Korean Family Values factor. KAS Acculturation Subscale scores were highest for Group 3, followed in order by Groups 1 and 2. Although no statistically significant differences were found for Biculturality Subscale scores, there was a trend for Group 3 to be lowest in Biculturality.

While each refugee group has its own set of challenges when adjusting to a new country, a better understanding of their needs may help facilitate their transition more quickly with lesser challenges. This study investigated the adjustment of one such group—Somali Bantus in a Midwestern U.S. city. Specifically, acculturation and school adaptation of Somali Bantu refugee children was explored using the Differentiated Multidimensional Model of Acculturation. Somali Bantu refugee children in 5 elementary schools were asked to complete a questionnaire that assessed their level of acculturation to American culture and level of retention of Somali Bantu culture, at three levels i.e. language, identity, and behavior. The 5 ESL teachers were asked to complete a questionnaire that assessed total difficulties in behaviors for each of their Somali Bantu student. Correlations, MANOVAs, and hierarchical regression analyses were used to analyze the data. The findings of this study documented the significant role of school context in the acculturation and school adaptation of these Somali Bantu refugee children. The findings demonstrated that age was statistically, significantly, and negatively related to overall American Acculturation (AAI) and statistically, significantly, and positively related to Proficiency Level Composite scores. These students' AAI scores were statistically, significantly, and positively related to their Somali Acculturation Index (SAI) scores. Furthermore, SAI scores were statistically, significantly, and positively related to grades on Social Behavior and grades on Social Behavior and Work Study Habits were statistically, significantly, and positively related. Also, age and length of time in the country were statistically, significantly, and positively related. The hierarchical regression analyses for AAI and ABA suggested that the demographic variables age, length of time in the US and gender did not contribute to any significant variance and school contributed a moderate variance to the overall AAI and ABA scores. School contributed substantially more incremental variance to ALA and AIA than did the other variables (age, length of time in the US and gender). Overall, the theoretical model including age, length of time in the US, gender and school explained 18, 25, 17 and 13 percent of the variance in the AAI, ALA, AIA and ABA respectively. The hierarchical regression analyses for SAI, SLA, SIA and SBA suggested that the demographic variables age, length of time in the US and gender contributed marginally significant variance. School contributed substantially more incremental variance to SAI, SLA and SBA and a small incremental variance to SIA than did the other demographic variables. Overall, the theoretical model including age, length of time in the US, gender and school explained 36, 20, 15, and 41 percent of the variance in the SAI, SLA, SIA, and SBA respectively. The hierarchical regression analyses for the school outcomes suggested that the demographic variables age, length of time in the US and gender contributed marginally significant variance in Total Difficulties and Proficiency Level Composite scores but none for Grades on Social behavior and Work Study Habits. School contributed slightly more incremental variance to Total Difficulties and Proficiency Level Composite scores a.

Vietnamese migrants constitute the largest Southeast Asian migrant group in Germany, yet there is no data on the relationship between the mental health status and acculturation among this population. Aims: Therefore, the present study examines the relationship between two well-established dimensions of acculturation, that is, dominant society immersion (DSI) and ethnic society immersion (ESI), the four resulting acculturation strategies (integration, assimilation, separation and marginalization), and severity of depression. Methods: A sample of N = 113 first-generation Vietnamese outpatients from a psychiatric outpatient clinic for Vietnamese migrants in Germany was studied regarding their self-reported depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)) and acculturation (Stephenson Multigroup Acculturation Scale (SMAS)). Results: Consistent with the hypotheses, patients reported less severe depressive symptoms, when they reported higher orientation toward the German and the Vietnamese society. Moreover, the results showed that integrated patients reported a lower severity of depression compared to marginalized patients, who reported the highest severity of depression. Conclusions: The findings indicate that among a sample of first-generation Vietnamese patients with depression, an orientation to both, the mainstream society and one’s heritage society might serve as a potential resource. The rejection of any orientation to any society is associated with an increased risk for depression.

It is unclear whether this association is mediated through genetic, environmental or cultural factors individually or in combination. This pilot study aimed to explore this interaction by determining if acculturation in migrant groups contributed to the prevalence of ADIMD. Method: Culturally diverse but relatively genetically homogeneous (white Caucasian) patients with schizophrenia (n = 40) treated at a single site were assessed for the presence of ADIMD and level of acculturation. Results: Higher levels of acculturation correlated with an increased prevalence of TD and akathisia but not Parkinsonism. The level of acculturation significantly predicted TD. Conclusion: This study identifies for the first time that acculturation significantly contributes to the prevalence of TD and akathisia but not Parkinsonism in culturally diverse migrant populations and must be accounted for when explaining ethnic variation in rates of ADIMD.

This article focuses on the role of host individuals in the networks of relations between immigrant populations and the communities from the dominant culture, as well as the changes experienced by host individuals because of their continuous contact with immigrants. This research applied a network approach to the study of the acculturation of host individuals. Two independent studies were carried out: a systematic analysis of the personal networks of Argentinean (n = 67), Ecuadorian (n = 59), Italian (n = 37) and German (n = 37) residents in Seville and Cadiz (Spain) (Study 1); and an ethnographic study with human service workers for Latin American immigrants in Boston (USA) (Study 2). With two different strategies, the role of host individuals in personal networks of foreigners in the United States and Spain was analyzed. The results show that host individuals tend to have less centrality than compatriots, showing an overall secondary role in the personal networks of immigrants. The lowest average centrality was observed in recent and temporal migrants, whereas the highest corresponded to the individuals with more time of residence in Spain. The personal networks of human service providers in the United States vary in ethnic composition and in their structural properties, and therefore shape different types of integrative bridges for immigrants.

First, we aimed at determining how acculturation preferences and emotions were related to specific intergroup behavioural tendencies towards majority and minority groups. Second, we aimed at developing an intergroup behavioural tendencies scale that differentiates between valence (facilitation and harm) and intensity (active and passive). The role of intergroup contact was also examined, as it is a known predictor of intergroup prejudice. In order to fulfil these goals, we carried out two studies. In Study 1, Spanish participants (N = 279) answered a questionnaire about Moroccans (a devalued group) or Ecuadorians (a valued group) by reporting their acculturation preferences for immigrants, their positive and negative emotions, quantity of contact with them and behavioural tendencies towards them. In Study 2, Moroccans (N = 92) and Ecuadorians (N = 87) assessed Spaniards on these measures. Results confirmed the structure of the new behavioural tendencies scale across four groups of participants. Overall, findings also showed that acculturation preferences and quantity of contact indirectly predicted behavioural tendencies through positive emotions. This research contributes to knowledge on how the majority and minority's acculturation preferences are related to their emotions and specific dimensions of intergroup behavioural tendencies, confirming the predominant mediating role of positive emotions in this process.

Meanwhile, the high socioeconomic status of some new immigrant groups also challenges the classical assumption that ties to co-ethnic community are associated with deviance. With a sample (n = 960) collected from a population of Chinese students in a large public university in the U.S., we tested how do the interplays between acculturation and co-ethnic ties affect substance use. This study establishes that: (1) different dimensions of acculturation have opposite effects on substance use; (2) acculturative stress does not explain the association between acculturation and substance use; (3) acculturation increases the likelihood of substance use only when one has weak attachment to their co-ethnic community. The findings are consistent for three dependent variables: smoking, drinking, and drunkenness, and for the different constructs of acculturation and co-ethnic ties. Ties to co-ethnic community may provide important social support for immigrants, while acculturation may alleviate the insular subculture that promotes at-risk behaviors. We encourage policy makers to consider the cooperative nature of acculturation and cultural retention for the improvement of health among this growing population.

Less is known about (a) how acculturation explains differences in family relationships by time in the US, and (b) whether acculturative stressors influence different aspects of immigrants’ family relationships. Drawing on an expanded acculturation framework, we explore whether and how attitudinal familism, family contact, and family conflict among immigrant Latina/os vary based on acculturation and acculturative stressors. Method: Using nationally representative data on foreign-born Latina/os (National Latino and Asian American Study; N = 1,618), ordered logistic and OLS regression analyses examined whether differences in family relationships by time in the US are explained by acculturation factors, and whether acculturative stressors are associated with family relationships when controlling for other important sociodemographic factors. Results: Accounting for acculturation reduces the effect of time in the US on attitudinal familism and family conflict to nonsignificance. Spanish language proficiency and ethnic identity are associated with higher attitudinal familism, while English proficiency is associated with increased family conflict. Additionally, acculturative stressors (involuntary context of exit, hostile context of reception, limited origin country ties) are associated with lower attitudinal familism and higher conflict. Conclusions: Results highlight the importance of (a) examining the ways that migration influences multiple aspects of family relationships, (b) adopting a more comprehensive acculturation framework.

In response, the present study attempted to examine the relationship between acculturation/enculturation and subjective well-being (SWB) by including social connectedness and its importance as a mediator and a moderator, respectively. One hundred eighty-eight Korean immigrants residing in two Midwestern metropolitan areas participated in this study. A survey questionnaire method was used for data collection. Structural equation modeling and hierarchical multiple regression analysis were used for mediation and moderation tests, respectively. The influence of acculturation was found to be partially mediated to SWB via social connectedness both in mainstream society and in the ethnic community. The influence of enculturation was found to be fully mediated to SWB via social connectedness in the ethnic community. In support of SWB theories of goal approaches and value-as-a moderator model, importance of social connectedness in mainstream society was found to moderate the relationship between social connectedness in mainstream society and positive affect. Importance of social connectedness in the ethnic community also was found to moderate the relationship between social connectedness in the ethnic community and positive affect.

It is well established that Asian Americans are fairly represented in professional occupations due to their educational attainment. However, Asian Americans are less represented in managerial positions. The mechanisms for this are not well understood. Similar to the high occupational attainment, Asian Americans are also one of the groups that have the best health outcomes. I argue that the evidence of positive health of Asian Americans is a result of the high percentage (70%) of foreign-born population and their decision to continue the lifestyle practices and cultural beliefs from their country of origin. As immigrants adapt to the American lifestyle, an 'Americanization' appears after a period of time to some extent, and occupational disparities and health advantages should gradually diminish. Specifically the major research questions are: (1) how do the immigrant generation and Asian ethnicity matter and what kind of factors affect the attainment of managerial occupations; and (2) how does acculturation into American society affect Asian Americans in chronic conditions and the risk factors such as obesity, cigarette smoking, physical inactivity, and heavy alcohol consumption by their immigrant generation and the length of residence in the United States. This dissertation research takes advantage of rich data from the 2000 U.S. Census and the National Health Interview Survey for Years 2000-2005. The most recent datasets hold sufficient sample size of native-born Asian Americans and provide the researcher a unique opportunity to capture intergenerational trends by categorizing immigrant generation into three groups: (1) the first-generation; (2) the 1.5-generation, and (3) the native-born Asian Americans. In light of evidence that there is a substantial heterogeneity among Asian Americans, distinguish Asian ethnicities to the extent possible. The findings suggest that (1) Asian Americans show higher levels of occupational attainment in both managerial and professional positions as immigrant generation progresses, and that (2) health advantages diminish as Asian Americans remain in the United States for a longer period of time and get acculturated.

Hierarchical regression models and structural equation modeling were used to test the direct, moderating, and mediating functions of social support and negative interaction on the effect of acculturative stress on depressive symptoms among Asian immigrants.

Based on the stress and coping model and the sociocultural model of stress, coping, and adaptation, this cross-sectional study examined the relationships among acculturative stress, coping, and depression in 111 non-institutionalized Korean immigrant elders aged 60 and older residing in areas without any Korean ethnic enclaves in three neighboring states of Southwestern Ohio, North Central Region of Kentucky, and Southern Indiana. A majority of convenience and snowball sample participated in self-administered mailed surveys, and a remaining few used phone surveys and personal interviews. Multiple regression analyses indicate that social support is the strongest predictor of depression, followed by somatization and acculturative stress. Principal component analysis indicates that the participants appraised limited English proficiency as the most stressful aspect of acculturative stress. Path analyses further reveal that acculturative stress had the largest total effect on depression and partially mediated the effect of the level of acculturation on depression. The results also show that social support had the large direct effect on depression and partially mediated the effect of acculturative stress on depression. Unexpectedly, religiosity was not a predictor of depression and did not have any effect on depression. Interestingly, somatization had the positive direct effect on depression. This study suggests that the level of acculturation, socioeconomic status and social support may influence acculturative stress and depression negatively; however, acculturative stress is the most significant risk factor for depression among the participants, decreasing coping efficacy of social support and increasing somatic symptoms. Implications for future research and practice are examined on social support from family and friends and on acculturative stress.

Although life-style changes after migration have been extensively studied in immigrant populations, the psychosocial impact of acculturative stress on biological markers of health is less understood. Thus, the purpose of the present study is to examine associations between acculturative stress and inflammatory markers in a Chinese immigrant population. Methods: Study participants (n = 407 foreign-born Chinese American women) completed questionnaires assessing levels of stress, including acculturative stress and positive and negative life events in the previous year. Participant height and weight were measured using standard protocols, and blood samples were drawn for assessment of circulating serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (sTNFR2). Results: Higher levels of acculturative stress were significantly associated with higher levels of CRP (B = 0.07, 95% confidence interval = 0.01-0.13, p = .031) and sTNFR2 (B = 0.02, 95% confidence interval = 0.004-0.03, p = .012), adjusting for age and body mass index. The latter association was no longer statistically significant when overall acculturation (i.e., identification with American culture) was included in the model. Life events were not associated with CRP or sTNFR2. Conclusions: This is one of the first studies to demonstrate that acculturative stress is associated with inflammatory markers in a Chinese immigrant population.

Our study also offers insights into the learning activities of older immigrants in general. In 2002, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a conceptual framework of active aging, which has greatly influenced aging policies and seniors’ everyday practices. Yet, there is a paucity of research that explicates and fully integrates lifelong learning into active aging discourse, and focuses on senior immigrants’ lifelong learning in an aging society. Based on interviews, textual materials, and participatory observation in five Chinese seniors’ immigrant associations in Toronto, we explore how Chinese senior immigrants’ learning has been (re)shaped and practised through re-settling in Canadian society. Five categories of learning are explored, including a) learning language and computer skills, b) learning culture and history, c) learning civic engagement, d) learning leisure, and e) learning health. We argue that ‘active learning’ can be used as a dynamic conceptual framework that interacts with active aging theory, demonstrating how senior immigrants actively participate in the lifelong learning project for participation and integration in Canada. This paper provides insights to the understanding of culturally sensitive policy-making on integration, health, and lifelong learning of older immigrants in Canada and beyond.

A.","Adapting culturally appropriate mental health screening tools for use among conflict-affected and other vulnerable adolescents in Nigeria.",0,"not acculturation","Background: The Boko Haram insurgency has brought turmoil and instability to Nigeria, generating a large number of internally displaced people and adding to the country's 17.5 million orphans and vulnerable children. Recently, steps have been taken to improve the mental healthcare infrastructure in Nigeria, including revamping national policies and initiating training of primary care providers in mental healthcare. In order for these efforts to succeed, they require means for community-based detection and linkage to care. A major gap preventing such efforts is the shortage of culturally appropriate, valid screening tools for identifying emotional and behavioral disorders among adolescents. In particular, studies have not conducted simultaneous validation of screening tools in multiple languages, to support screening and detection efforts in linguistically diverse populations. We aim to culturally adapt screening tools for emotional and behavioral disorders for use among adolescents in Nigeria, in order to facilitate future validation studies. Methods: We used a rigorous mixed-method process to culturally adapt the Depression Self Rating Scale, Child PTSD Symptom Scale, and Disruptive Behavior Disorders Rating Scale. We employed expert translations, focus group discussions (N = 24), and piloting with cognitive interviewing (N = 24) to achieve semantic, content, technical, and criterion equivalence of screening tool items. Results: We identified and adapted items that were conceptually difficult for adolescents to understand, conceptually non-equivalent across languages, considered unacceptable to discuss, or stigmatizing. Findings regarding problematic items largely align with existing literature regarding cross-cultural adaptation. Conclusions: Culturally adapting screening tools represents a vital first step toward improving community case detection.

Hispanics and Asians comprised the largest groups (58% and 16%), respectively. Today, the Hispanic population is the largest ethnic minority in the United States (15%) and is a majority of the U.S. foreign-born population (47%). While immigration is a positive process for most immigrants, resettlement into a new country has challenges, including acculturation adjustments. Youth engage in risky behaviors such as substance use and antisocial behaviors. For immigrant youth with limited supportive opportunities, however, the acculturation process can be difficult. Stress, alienation, and stigma often manifest and cause behavioral problems, including aggression. This pilot study examines the mediating effect of antisocial attitudes using sociocultural, developmental, and environmental factors to understand Hispanic youth problem behaviors. We sampled 136 youths, ages 6–12, from predominantly Hispanic elementary schools in the southwestern United States to ascertain the role of aggression and antisocial behavior in substance use attitudes. The results show significant differences in aggression, antisocial attitudes, and substance use according to (1) age, (2) years in the United States, (3) English level, and (4) relationship with mother. Aggression significantly predicted antisocial attitudes and substance use, with antisocial attitudes having a mediating effect on the relationship between aggression and substance use. In developing social service programs to prevent substance use among children from immigrant families, social work educators and practitioners may consider addressing the role of aggression in Hispanic adolescents’ future behavior.

The present study adopts an ecological approach to investigate how refugees perceive the welcoming climate in Germany and the consequences of this perception. To further explore the refugees’ situation, we examined several predictors of their psychological adjustment and acculturation attitudes. In a field study in Eastern Germany with N = 94 refugees as participants, we assessed the perceived context of reception, and perceived acculturation attitudes as contextual variables, discrimination and contact as intergroup variables and, on the individual level, psychological adjustment as well as the personal acculturation attitudes as dependent variables. The results revealed that more perceived discrimination resulted in an increase in reported psychological problems. Refugees living in asylum centers reported more psychological problems and more perceived discrimination than those living in independent housing. The perceived context of reception positively predicted refugees’ desire for maintenance of intergroup relations with the host society. Positive intergroup contact lowered their desire for cultural maintenance. In sum, this study gives us rare and valuable insight into refugees’ perspectives in the context of recent immigration to Germany. In doing so, it emphasizes the importance of a welcoming climate. The study shows how meaningful the assessment of the perceived context of reception is. Practical implications for fields such as the accommodation of refugees are discussed.

Design: A convenience sample of 200 self-identified Chinese and Koreans, aged 65 years and older, were interviewed. Psychometric analysis was conducted to examine the reliability and validity of a new social support measure. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to examine the relationship between social support and psychological well-being. Results: Factor analysis revealed a four-factor solution of social support and adequate psychometrics of all social support scales was found. Multivariate results suggest that Koreans have more depression than Chinese (p < 0.01). Those who lived with their spouse and adult children had lower overall psychological well-being (p < 0.05) and lower positive affect (p < 0.05) compared to those who lived alone. Having more emotional/companionship support significantly (p < 0.001) contributed to better overall psychological well-being, having less depression and higher positive affect. Conclusions: A new multidimensional social support measure for use with older Chinese and Koreans could be useful upon further validation. These results suggest that older Chinese and Koreans' psychological well-being may be negatively affected when they live with their adult children. More depression in Koreans may be related to difficulties in expanding their social network beyond Korean-speaking people.

While Hmong immigrants acknowledge the importance of healthy eating and physical activity, to our knowledge no studies have looked at health promoting behaviors among Hmong adolescents with and without disabilities. Objective: In this paper, we seek to provide baseline data about physical activity and healthy eating among Hmong high school students with disabilities in Minnesota. Methods: We used data from the 2016 Minnesota Student Survey. The study included responses from 1,824 Hmong high school students. We compared physical activity and healthy eating of Hmong high school students by disability status. Results: Approximately 13% of Hmong had a disability (n = 239). A greater percentage of Hmong high school students with disabilities reported zero days of 60 min of physical activity (20.5% vs 14.8%, p < 0.10) and zero days participation in sports teams outside of school (69.0% vs. 64.3%, p < 0.10). Compared to Hmong students without disabilities, a significantly lower percentage of Hmong students with disabilities reported not receiving free/reduced lunch (66.5% vs 73.1%, p < 0.05) and significantly more likely to skip meals because their family did not have enough money (14.2% vs 9.7%, p < 0.05). Conclusion: Adolescent Hmong with disabilities encounter both cultural and disability specific factors which could contribute to poorer health promoting behaviors. This study shines light on the need for social policy that promotes disability inclusive, culturally specific health promotion information and advocacy for immigrant youth with disabilities and their families in schools and communities.

The Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.",0,"not acculturation","The growing size and changing composition of the foreign-born population in the USA highlights the importance of examining the health consequences of living in neighborhoods with higher proportions of immigrants. Using data from the Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis in four US cities, we examined whether neighborhood immigrant composition was associated with health behaviors (diet, physical activity) among Hispanic and Chinese Americans (n = 1902). Secondarily we tested whether neighborhoods with high proportions of immigrants exhibited better or worse neighborhood quality, and whether these dimensions of neighborhood quality were associated with healthy behaviors. Neighborhood immigrant composition was defined based on the Census 2000 tract percent of foreign-born from Latin-America, and separately, percent foreign-born from China. After adjustment for age, gender, income, education, neighborhood poverty, and acculturation, living in a tract with a higher proportion of immigrants was associated with lower consumption of high-fat foods among Hispanics and Chinese, but with being less physically active among Hispanics. Residents in neighborhoods with higher proportions of immigrants reported better healthy food availability, but also worse walk ability, fewer recreational exercise resources, worse safety, lower social cohesion, and lower neighborhood-based civic engagement. Associations of neighborhood immigrant composition with diet persisted after adjustment for reported neighborhood characteristics, and associations with physical activity were attenuated. Respondent-reported neighborhood healthy food availability, walk ability, availability of exercise facilities and civic participation remained associated with behaviors after adjusting for immigrant composition and other covariates. Results show that living in an immigrant enclave is not monolithically beneficial and may have different associations with different health behaviors.

This study compared student and teacher reports of psychological symptoms in a diverse sample of recently immigrated youth. Students (N = 174) attended public high schools in a northeastern city. Students and teachers independently completed the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment, and four DSM-derived subscales were explored. Psychological symptoms among immigrant students were higher than normative rates. Across all subscales, teacher ratings of student symptoms were significantly lower than student self-reported symptoms, and this difference was larger than that found in a normative sample. Results suggest that many immigrant youth experience psychological problems but may not be perceived as being in distress. Therefore, the most effective assessment approach may be active screening, rather than relying on self initiated help-seeking or teacher observation alone.

Immigrants can invest in these assets to create wealth and improve their welfare. Research indicates that many immigrants do not invest in financial assets in the United States because they have low education, are unemployed, or have low income. The problem addressed in this study was low financial market participation among African immigrants in Connecticut despite high education and employment. The purpose of this qualitative multiple case study was to explore their perceptions of why they did not invest in financial assets to build wealth. A sample of 15 educated and employed African immigrants were selected by purposive snowball and criterion sampling from a personal list, and specific sites. Three research questions asked African immigrants to describe what they perceived impeded their participation, what they could do, or might be done to help them participate, and whether or not lack of financial literacy was part of the problem. In this study, multiple data collection methods were conducted including informal face-to-face, open-ended semi-structured/unstructured interviews, online questionnaires, telephone interviews, and document review. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analyses to identify themes related to the research questions. Results indicated that low financial literacy was the most important factor contributing to low financial market participation among educated and employed African immigrants. Acculturation apathy, impinging on the ability to learn and embrace American values might contribute to low financial literacy among African immigrants. Pointedly, African cultural anchors doused with religious beliefs, which undermine hard work and preparedness for the future, may also contribute to low financial participation. Recommendations for practice include providing African immigrants with financial literacy education by community- based organizations, non-profits, service providers, and financial institutions. Future research should explore how African cultural and religious beliefs might influence financial behaviors. This study was limited to African immigrants in Connecticut; future research may replicate this study in different geographical locations, or explore how two different groups- Christians and Muslims, operating under the same economic and cultural environment in Africa perceive money and wealth.

Berry (2013) proposed that intercultural relations can be understood on the basis of three hypotheses: the multiculturalism hypothesis, the integration hypothesis, and the contact hypothesis. Our goal was to test these three hypotheses in Russian majority and Asian minority groups. Migrants from Central Asia (N = 168; 88 ethnic Uzbeks and 80 ethnic Tajiks) and ethnic Russians (N = 158) were surveyed using a self-report questionnaire that included measures developed by the Mutual Intercultural Relations in Plural Societies project. Data processing was carried out using Structural Equation Modeling with the Russians and the migrants separately. We found significant and positive relationships between perceived security and multicultural ideology in both groups. We found a positive relationship between intercultural contacts and the integration strategy among the migrants from Central Asia. Intercultural contacts in the group of Russians was positively related to the expectation of integration and negatively related to the expectation of assimilation. The integration strategy of the migrants was positively related to their self-esteem, while the assimilation strategy was positively related to their sociocultural adaptation and life satisfaction. Among the Russians, the integration expectation promoted their better life satisfaction and self-esteem. The multiculturalism hypothesis was partially supported with both the migrants from Central Asia and the Russians: perceived security promoted an acceptance of multicultural ideology but didn’t promote ethnic tolerance. The contact hypothesis was partially supported in both groups: interethnic contacts were positively linked to the integration strategy of the migrants and the integration expectations of the Russians. The integration hypothesis was fully supported in the sample of Russians and partially supported in the sample of migrants. The migrants’ adoption of the assimilation strategy promoted their life satisfaction and sociocultural adaptation.

Recent immigration has resulted in an increasingly large number of residents in Canada and the US who represent both an immigrant and an ethnic minority status. Among such residents are Chinese immigrants. Because of the potentially large number of school-age children who are part of these families, the family functioning of the new Chinese immigrants with school-age children would be important for the children’s development. This study therefore compared 112 Chinese families who recently immigrated to Canada with 90 Caucasian non-immigrant families. Scales were administered to the families to measure various aspects of family functioning. The results showed that the Chinese immigrants experienced a lower degree of family cohesion. Their socio-ecological factors were both similar and different from the non-immigrants, with a lower degree of social support and certain differences in child-rearing practices than the non-immigrants. Social support and child-rearing practices were differentially related to different dimensions of family functioning. However, these relationships were not entirely unique to the immigrants. The results have increased our understanding of immigrants and may contribute to the provision of effective support for immigrants. Implications are suggested for community support for immigrants and for further research.

In addition, it also examined the relationship between demographic factors and adjustment and compared the predictive value of attachment styles and demographic factors for immigrants' adjustment. The Attachment Style Questionnaire was used to assess respondents' attachment. Psychological adjustment was measured with the Psychological Health Scale and the Satisfaction With Life Scale. Sociocultural adjustment was measured with the Social Support List—Interactions scale. Two scales for measuring identification and contact with the native and with the Dutch culture were developed and used as indicators of cultural adjustment. We found relations between attachment styles and psychological and sociocultural adjustment. Secure attachment was positively related (p < .01) to psychological and sociocultural adjustment, fearful attachment was negatively (p < .01) associated with psychological adjustment, and more negatively with identification with the Dutch culture than with identification with the native culture. Preoccupied attachment was negatively related (p < .01) to psychological adjustment and to identification with the Dutch culture. Dismissing attachment was weakly negatively related (p < .01) to sociocultural adjustment. Correlation patterns across the three immigrants' samples indicate that dismissing individuals remain relatively indifferent towards their native and the Dutch culture. Regarding demographic factors we found that education and age at immigration were positively associated with psychological and sociocultural adjustment, and length of residence appeared to be positively related to sociocultural adjustment. In general, demographic factors showed a stronger association with sociocultural than with psychological adjustment. Regression analysis revealed that attachment styles were better predictors of immigrants' psychological and sociocultural adjustment than demographic factors—education, age at immigration, and length of residence. The results indicate that immigrant studies would benefit from taking an attachment perspective.

The purpose of this study was to explore the help-seeking behavior of this population. A convenience sample (N = 132) was recruited from first-generation adult Iranian immigrants. Based on the frameworks of the eco-cultural, psychosocial development, and social support theories, a quantitative cross-sectional design was used to examine the impact of gender, level of acculturation, educational level, age at the time of immigration, length of stay, and perception of social support on participants' help-seeking attitudes. Data were collected using a demographic questionnaire, the Iranian Self-Identity Acculturation Scale, Perceived Social Support Scale, and the Inventory of Attitudes Toward Seeking Mental Health Services. The impact of gender, levels of acculturation and education, younger age at the time of immigration, longer length of residency, and positive perception of social support on the attitudes toward seeking mental health services were tested using Pearson's correlation, ANOVA, t tests, and multiple regression. The results of the study showed that gender and education level were positively correlated and perceived social support was negatively correlated with attitudes toward seeking mental health services. As for the social change implications, this study adds to the body of the literature on multicultural counseling and may help mental health professionals provide culturally sensitive services to these relatively new immigrants.

This study used a modified questionnaire consistent with a multidimensional model to examine behavioral acculturation, psychological acculturation and psychological well-being across generations of Vietnamese immigrants and refugees living in the U.S. Sociodemographic and migrant variables were used to investigate their relationships to behavioral and psychological acculturation toward the U.S. and Vietnamese dimensions and psychological well-being across generations of Vietnamese. Using a quasi-experimental design, data were collected from 590 Vietnamese immigrants and refugees living in the U.S. Multiple regression analyses were calculated to determine the amount of variance accounted for in behavioral and psychological acculturation toward the U.S. dimension and psychological well-being. Results suggested that sociodemographic variables of Income, Religion, Current Age, Education in the U.S., Education in Vietnam, and Gender, as well as migrant variables of Generational Status, Age of Arrival, and Reason for Migration were significant predictors of behavioral acculturation of the U.S. Dimension. Psychological acculturation of the U.S. dimension was also shown to be predictable by sociodemographic variables, such as Income, Education in Vietnam, and Occupation, and migrant variables that included Proportion of Life in the U.S. and Reason for Migration. Other results supported past research that first generation immigrants and refugees tended to practice more customs of the Vietnamese observable behaviors and are more likely to have similar values and preferences for the Vietnamese culture compared to individuals who were born in the U.S. or who entered at the U.S. before the age of 8. However, contrary to past research, the results showed no direct relationship between emotional distress and acculturation toward the Vietnamese culture. Consistent with a bipolar model, a negative relationship was detected between behavioral acculturation of the U.S. and Vietnamese dimensions. An unexpected outcome was observed in psychological acculturation, where a significant positive relationship occurred between the U.S. and Vietnamese dimensions. This phenomenon would not have been detected if it was assessed using a bipolar model assessment.

In immigrant populations, communicating the risks poses greater challenges since linguistic and cultural barriers may impede acceptance of the new behavior. The Brazilian population on Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, is at high risk for Lyme disease (LD), the most common vector-borne illness in the United States largely preventable by limiting tick exposure. We surveyed 103 Brazilians on MV about their health beliefs and perceptions of LD risk and assessed their level of precautionary behaviors and the cultural factors influencing them. The population had only a moderate perception of risk and little understanding of LD. Forty-one percent did not think LD posed a risk, while 79% were not sure they could recognize symptoms. Accordingly, the population as a whole reported taking few precautions.

Whereas Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are common conditions in this population of frail older adults, little is known about the beliefs of foreign home care workers about ADRD or about their practices. Methods: A mixed-methods design was conducted in 2006–2007 in Israel. The study included a survey of beliefs about ADRD completed by 184 Filipino home care workers and qualitative interviews with 29 Filipino home care workers. Results: On seven of the 14 belief items, more than 30% of the workers were in discordance with scientific view about ADRD. Those workers who were not informed about the care recipient’s medical conditions were more likely to report beliefs that were inconsistent with current scientific knowledge. In qualitative interviews, Filipino home care workers reported using intuitively behavioral techniques when caring for older adults with ADRD. Conclusions: Despite the fact that some of the workers’ beliefs are inconsistent with current scientific view, their actual intuitive practices are consistent with the scientific paradigm. Specific emphasis has to be placed on encouraging workers’ intuitive approach to ADRD and providing workers with ample information about the medical conditions and needs of the care recipient.

Using a phenomenological method, seven adult female Bosnian refugees each participated in an audio-recorded interview lasting from one to two hours. Two major themes emerged from the analyses of the text: belonging and adapting. Belonging included concepts of cultural memory, identity and difference, empathy and reciprocity, and perfection of speech. Adapting focused on coping with transitions, coping with memories of past and attendant losses, coping with accepting a new culture while trying to fit into the new culture, and learning the new language perfectly. Implicit in the refugees' experiences were states of culture shock, loneliness, psychic numbness, grief, nostalgia, and feelings of dejection, humiliation, inferiority, and feeling as if they belonged nowhere. Simultaneously, the refugees reported feelings of relief and safety after leaving behind the threat of death in their old homes, feelings of gratefulness for their new freedom to hope for a better life, and their restored ability to notice beauty, as well as a sense of normalcy in their new lives. Recommendations for nursing research include the need to identify additional factors promoting successful belonging and adapting in refugees. Recommendations for nursing practice include the importance of adopting a perspective that is respectful of the uniqueness of each refugee and the necessity for recognizing the normal processes of refugee adaptation.

Syndemic severity remained significant in multivariate analyses for multiple sex partners (OR = 1.53, p = 0.04). Moderation analyses showed higher syndemic severity was associated with more condom use among immigrants (OR = 1.75, p = 0.04) and less condom use (OR = 0.07, p = 0.011) among those with separated orientation. Higher syndemic severity also predicted greater odds for multiple partners (OR = 2.40, p = 0.01) among immigrants. This evidence suggests a sexual risk syndemic exists among Latina adolescents.

Value preferences of immigrants compared to local-born populations in the receiving country and in the country of origin.",NA,NA,"In the present study, we investigate value preferences of immigrants, comparing them with local-born populations in the receiving country and in the immigrants’ country of origin. In addition, we test the effect of time in the receiving country on the value preferences of immigrants. Three groups of respondents took part in the study: Israeli-born Jews (n = 1,082), immigrants from the Former Soviet Union in Israel (n = 237), and Jews living in Russia (n = 935). Differences in value preferences between the groups and their relationship with time in country in the immigrants’ value preferences were hypothesized on the basis of four psychological mechanisms: premigration formation of values and their preservation in the new country, self-selection of immigrants, acculturation (classical and paradoxical), and a reaction to the stress of adjustment in the new country. The results obtained demonstrated that the value system of immigrants in general was different from the value system of the nonimmigrant populations in both the country of origin and in the receiving country. When comparing immigrants and two other populations in each of the 19 basic values separately, it was found that immigrants reported higher levels of power dominance, power resources, and security social values, and lower levels of values of universalism tolerance, universalism concern, benevolence dependability, and self-direction thought than both the other groups. Results mainly corroborated what we have termed a Stress Reaction Value Constellation model. Adjustment difficulties encountered by immigrants in the receiving country and their survival needs may explain the specific pattern of value preferences found among immigrants.

However, by continuing to focus on consumers’ lived experiences, researchers lack theoretical clarity on the institutional shaping of these individuals as ethnic consumers, which has important implications for sustaining neocolonial power imbalances between colonized (immigrant-sending) and colonizing (immigrant-receiving) cultures. We bring sociological theories of neoliberal governmentality and multiculturalism to bear on an in-depth analysis of the contemporary Canadian marketplace to reveal our concept of market-mediated multiculturation, which we define as an institutional mechanism for attenuating ethnic group conflicts through which immigrant-receiving cultures fetishize strangers and their strangeness in their commodification of differences, and the existence of inequalities between ethnicities is occluded. Specifically, our findings unpack four interrelated consumer socialization strategies (envisioning, exemplifying, equipping, and embodying) through which institutional actors across different fields (politics, market research, retail, and consumption) shape an ethnic consumer subject. We conclude with a critical discussion of extant scholarship on consumer acculturation as being complicit in sustaining entrenched colonialist biases.

Using a developmental psychopathology framework, in the present study we examined the effect of bicultural stress on alcohol misuse among immigrated Hispanic adolescents, indirectly through trajectories of identity formation and alcohol expectancies. Our sample consisted of 302 recently immigrated Hispanic adolescents (53 % male; Mage = 14.5 at baseline) who were interviewed every 6 months for 3 years. Bivariate growth curve modeling was used to examine the influence of initial early bicultural stress on later alcohol misuse via change in identity development (i.e., coherence and confusion) and subsequent growth in cognitive alcohol expectancies. Findings revealed that initial levels and growth of identity coherence were not significantly associated with either bicultural stress or tension reduction (TR) alcohol expectancies. Multiple mediation analyses indicated that the effect of bicultural stress at time 1 on the frequency of being drunk at time 6 was mediated via high initial levels of identity confusion, followed by growth in risky TR expectancies (T4–T6).

As homophily (the phenomenon that people principally form relationships with those who are similar to them) influences people’s norms and interactions, it might be an important property of migrants’ networks, and have implications on their health. The aim of this study is to examine health inequities between natives and immigrants in Sweden and the health consequences arising from participation in homogenous migrant networks. Using total population registers and representative survey data initial analyses show that migrants experience poorer health than native Swedes. The findings further suggest that homophily is a prominent feature of migrant social networks and that migrants in networks with a high proportion of other migrants experience poorer health than those who include a high proportion of natives in their networks. However, unhealthy behaviour and disadvantaged social conditions may account for a considerable share of their excess risk. Hence, network closure may reinforce and maintain norms leading to negative behaviour and social conditions in such networks.

However, this immigrant health advantage appears to diminish with duration of residence in the U.S. Few studies of the effects of immigrants’ exposure to the U.S. have focused on perinatal health. This study used three contemporary national datasets to describe patterns in infant birth weight by maternal duration of residence in the U.S. For both immigrants overall and Hispanic immigrants in particular, rates of low birth weight appeared to decline over the first few years in the U.S. and increase thereafter. This curvilinear association was robust across the three datasets and deviates somewhat from the prevailing notion that immigrant health declines monotonically over time.

As empirical studies on immigrant transnationalism are still scarce, the purpose of this study was to investigate mean levels and determinants of a core component of transnationalism—transnational travel. Hypotheses were based on context of exiting homeland, living conditions in Germany and demographic and sociocultural variables. Transnational travel behaviour was assessed as frequency of return trips in three immigrant groups in Germany: ethnic Germans, Russian Jews and Turks. Interviews were conducted with 894 women participants from these groups. Results showed substantial transnational travel behaviour in all groups with Turks reporting higher levels than ethnic Germans and Russian Jews. Interindividual differences in transnational travel within groups were also examined. Results indicated similarities (e.g. network size in home country related positively to transnational travel frequency in all groups) and group‐specific associations (e.g. co‐ethnic identifying related positively to transnational travel frequency among Turks, but negatively for the other groups). Our study highlights the need for a new understanding of immigration and emphasises the consideration of group‐specific mechanisms in transnational travel behaviour.

We studied two kinds of antecedents: majority members’ perceptions of Turkish minorities’ acculturation behavior and their experiences of intergroup contact. The possible mediating role of outgroup affect was also investigated. 247 Flemish high school students completed a survey. Data were analyzed using path analyses. Results show that positive contact experiences and perceiving that Turkish immigrants make efforts to engage in contact with the host group and/or to adopt the host culture are associated with less negative affective reactions towards Turkish migrants. Perceiving that Turkish immigrants maintain their heritage culture is associated with more negative affective reactions. Our results further revealed that increased negative affective reactions are associated with less support for culture maintenance and for contact with the host group but with a higher demand for host culture adoption. The present results also show that expectations of contact engagement and expectations of host culture adoption cannot be considered as equivalent. This implies that results from studies using Berry's conceptualization of acculturation expectations (Berry, 2001) and results from studies using Bourhis’ conceptualization of acculturation expectations (Bourhis, Moïse, Perreault, & Senécal, 1997) are not directly comparable. Our data also clearly disconfirm the orthogonal structure of the fourfold acculturation model for majority members’ acculturation expectations, suggesting that relying on the specific dimensions defining acculturation expectations may constitute a more valid approach to understand ongoing acculturation processes.

"628","Search2021","thesis",2011,"Thikeo, Manivone","Cambodian and Laotian Americans' cultural values and attitudes toward seeking professional psychological services.",NA,NA,"Several studies have reported that Asian Americans, including Cambodian and Laotian Americans, tend to under utilize mental health services, both inpatient and outpatient although they display high levels of psychological problems related to significant psychological trauma experienced in their native land or while living in refugee camps. Underutilization may not be related to the lack of need but it may relate to cultural factors such as shame and stigma as well as acculturation and lack of health insurance. Although some Asian American research about help seeking exists, no previous research has specifically addressed this question with a Cambodian and Laotian population. This study was designed to investigate demographic and acculturation variables that might help understand why. This study used data from 108 Cambodians and Laotians adults (18+) living in Rhode Island. Participants completed (1) a demographic questionnaire sheet; (2) the Sin-Lew Asian Self Identity Acculturation Scale (AS-ASIA); (3) the Attitude Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help Scale (ATSPPHS). Results show that only one demographic variable, gender, demonstrated a robust relationship with help seeking, with females being significantly more likely than males to recognize the need for help, have less stigma about seeking help, be more open to discussing problems and more confident that professional services would be of assistance. In contrast, neither age, nor education having health insurance was significantly related to help seeking. Level of acculturation was strongly related to help seeking, contributing, in hierarchical regression analyses, unique variance over and above the set of demographic variables. Further, acculturation was related to two specific dimensions of help seeking (e.g., openness to discussing problems and confidence in professional help). A discussion of tailoring change efforts to these particular dimensions as well as females is offered as useful in engaging Laotian and Cambodian populations. Further, females are not only likely to seek help but they are also able to influent others, especially males, to seek help through their traditional role as a 'wives and mother.' Limitations of this research are discussed and suggestions made for future research efforts.

Specifically, we explored the impact of race-based rejection sensitivity on well-being, and whether cultural identity clarity could help curtail any negative effects. Hypothesis 1 was that race-based rejection sensitivity would be negatively associated with well-being. Hypothesis 2 was that cultural identity clarity would moderate the association between race-based rejection sensitivity and well-being such that Latino/a immigrants lower in cultural identity clarity would experience poorer well-being than those higher in cultural identity clarity. Method: A community sample of Latino/a immigrants (N = 136; Mage = 38.21; 51.47% female) completed a survey including measures of race-based rejection sensitivity, cultural identity clarity, bicultural stress, self-esteem, and life satisfaction. Results: Correlation and regression analyses revealed that race-based rejection sensitivity was negatively associated with well-being. Additionally, high cultural identity clarity attenuated the negative association between race-based rejection sensitivity and well-being. Conclusion: Results of the present study suggest maintaining clarity over their heritage cultures postimmigration can be beneficial to Latino/a immigrants in Canada, in particular when they are sensitive to cues of racial discrimination.

Limited comprehension of cancer prevention information may contribute to this association. The authors used a stepwise linear regression to model acculturation and socioeconomic factors as predictors of comprehension (colon cancer and general health information) and screening intention in a sample of 78 Spanish-speaking immigrant women in Canada. The authors used the McNemar test to look for changes in women's screening intention. They used the Bidimensional Acculturation Scale, a language-based scale, to assess acculturation. Among English-as-a-second-language immigrant women, acculturation, television and Internet use, age, and Spanish-language education predicted comprehension of cancer prevention information, F(3, 69) = 6.76, p < .001, R² = .23. These variables also predicted comprehension of general health information, via the short form of the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults, F(4, 68) = 12.13, p < .001, R² = .42; and the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine, F(2, 70) = 7.54, p = .001, R² = .17. However, the variables did not predict screening intention. More women expressed intention to be screened after reading the cancer prevention information than expected by chance alone, p = .002. Acculturation is an important influence on the comprehension of health information by older English-as-a-second- language immigrant women. However, other culture-related factors not measured by the Bidimensional Acculturation Scale likely influence their exposure to and understanding of health and cancer prevention information.

A.","Cervical cancer screening and Chinese women: Insights from focus groups.",0,"not acculturation","Objective: Despite extensive efforts to raise awareness, Papanicolaou (Pap) testing rates among Chinese women living in North America remain low compared with Euro-American women. Although the lower Pap testing rate and ensuing health repercussions among Chinese women are well characterized, mechanisms underlying such health disparities are not. The aim of this study was to use a qualitative approach to delineate such mechanisms. Qualitative approaches to understand constructs within the domain of sexual and reproductive health have been shown to be particularly appropriate, and offer a nuanced view of sexuality that is not afforded by traditional quantitative methods. Method: We carried out two focus groups aimed at exploring how Mandarin-speaking and English-speaking Chinese women experience Pap testing (N = 12). The women were invited to partake in the focus groups from having participated in a large-scale quantitative study. Participants were all first-generation immigrants and their average age was 53-years-old. We used content analyses to analyze transcripts and extract themes. Results and Discussion: The women heavily endorsed traditional Chinese medicine philosophy, conceptualizing physical health holistically, and valuing preventative measures over screening and interceptive measures. Pap testing was described as qualitatively different from other screening procedures, such that women assigned a sexually charged meaning to Pap testing, often discussing it in relation to sexual activity and promiscuity. Women expressed their preference for the compulsory and depersonalized manner that Pap tests are performed in their home country of China, as this lessens the embarrassment associated with undergoing Pap testing. Conclusion: Three mechanisms may contribute to lower Pap testing among middle-aged first-generation Chinese immigrants: preference for Chinese medicine philosophy, perceived sexualization of Pap testing, and the institutionalization of medical care. Implications for improving the reproductive health of Chinese women are discussed.

Results indicated that changes in social functioning were not related to changes in plasma oxytocin. Instead, baseline oxytocin predicted changes in social relationship satisfaction, social support, and loneliness over time. In contrast, plasma vasopressin changed as a function of social integration. Baseline vasopressin was not related to changes in social functioning over time.

The findings reveal a gap between these individuals’ changing sexual behaviours and the continuing silence on sex. Although Canada has exposed them to a new living environment that has shaped the dynamics and patterns of their sexual practices, their incomplete integration into the host society and their close connections with China as the home country mean that traditional Chinese norms continue to influence their understanding of these changes. With the increasing openness of these immigrants’ sexual relationships, the obsolescence of their consciousness and knowledge of sexuality should be addressed in order to reduce their vulnerability to sexual inequalities and consequent health risks.

Archived data that was collected for 1499 clients over a two year period (2007–2009) was analysed using descriptive statistics and χ². The results indicated that clients were referred from a range of sources and were generally adults. There were more women than men, who sought services. At least half of the clients had language barriers and relied on bilingual workers. Most frequently expressed mental health issues were mood disorder symptoms, followed by symptoms of schizophrenia and psychosis and anxiety. Acculturation strains and stressors were described as the most common psychosocial issues.

The aim of this study was to compare performance on the Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale (RUDAS) and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) in Turkish immigrants in Denmark and determine the impact of demographic and health‐related variables on test performance. A sample of non‐demented community‐dwelling Turkish immigrants was recruited from the greater Copenhagen area. All participants completed a structured interview regarding demographic, physical and mental health status, as well as measures of depression and acculturation, and cognitive testing with the RUDAS and the MMSE. A total of 76 non‐demented participants aged 50 or more were included in the study. The mean performance on the RUDAS and the MMSE was 26.8 (SD 2.4) and 23.7 (SD 4.3), respectively. In group comparisons, correlation analyses and regression analyses, level of schooling represented a more significant variable for RUDAS and MMSE performance than any other variable. However, the impact of schooling was considerably more pronounced on the MMSE and the test was not found to be a valid measure of general cognitive function in subjects with less than five years of schooling. Although not entirely free of educational bias, the RUDAS can be a valuable supplement to the MMSE for assessment of general cognitive function in Turkish minority populations.

The present research proposed a construct termed global orientation to denote individual differences in the psychological processes of acculturating to the globalizing world. It encompasses multicultural acquisition as a proactive response and ethnic protection as a defensive response to globalization. Ten studies examined the applicability of global orientations among majority and minority groups, including immigrants and sojourners, in multicultural and relatively monocultural contexts, and across Eastern and Western cultures. Multicultural acquisition is positively correlated with both independent and interdependent self-construals, bilingual proficiency and usage, and dual cultural identifications. Multicultural acquisition is promotion-focused, while ethnic protection is prevention-focused and related to acculturative stress. Global orientations affect individuating and modest behavior over and above multicultural ideology, predict overlap with outgroups over and above political orientation, and predict psychological adaptation, sociocultural competence, tolerance, and attitudes toward ethnocultural groups over and above acculturation expectations/strategies. Global orientations also predict English and Chinese oral presentation performance in multilevel analyses and the frequency and pleasantness of intercultural contact in cross-lagged panel models. We discuss how the psychological study of global orientations contributes to theory and research on acculturation, cultural identity, and intergroup relations.

L.","Confirming the multidimensionality of psychological well-being among Korean immigrant mothers in the United States.",0,"not acculturation","Ryff’s Psychological Well-Being (PWB) Scale is a theoretically derived instrument that focuses on six dimensions of eudaimonic well-being. Although the PWB scale has been widely used in both clinical and general samples with different sociodemographic characteristics, its factor structure within first-generation Korean immigrant mothers requires examination, as they often face sociocultural challenges due to immigration-related experiences (e.g., acculturation stress, being socially and culturally segregated, following heritage cultural obligations to be a 'wise mother and good wife,' or taking less prestigious jobs) that could negatively influence their well-being. This study examined the factor structure of an 18-item version of the PWB scale in a sample of 169 first-generation Korean immigrant mothers of young children in the United States. A second-order confirmatory factor analysis did not support the original factor structure of the PWB scale. More importantly, high correlations among some of the PWB subscales suggested that the PWB factors may not be distinct from each other and the number of factors should be reduced. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted on the four highly correlated factors in subsequent analyses, and three new factors (Satisfaction with Life, Goal Orientation, and Positive Self-Perceptions) were identified. The newly derived PWB factors were negatively correlated with mothers’ depressive symptoms. These findings advanced our understanding of psychological well-being in first-generation Korean immigrant mothers and highlighted the need to consider sociocultural factors in mental health research with this population.

Hispanics and other population sub-groups.",0,"not acculturation","In recent decades there has been an increasing interest in understanding the role of social and physical contexts in influencing health behaviors and outcomes. This is especially true for weight, which is considered to be highly dependent on environmental factors. The evidence linking neighborhood characteristics to weight in the United States, however, is mixed. Many studies in this area are hampered by cross sectional designs and a limited scope, insofar as they investigate only one dimension of neighborhood context. It is also unclear to what extent neighborhood characteristics account for racial/ethnic disparities in weight. Using longitudinal data from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (L.A. FANS), we compare patterns of weight change between Hispanics and other racial and ethnic groups in order to evaluate whether we observe a pattern of unhealthy assimilation in weight among Hispanic immigrants and to identify differences in the rate at which different groups gain weight over time. We also explore the extent to which patterns of weight change are related to a wider range of community characteristics. We find that weight increases across all groups between the two study waves of L.A. FANS and that the increases are significant except for Asians/Pacific Islanders. With respect to differences in the pace of weight change, second and higher generation Hispanic women and black men gain weight more rapidly than their first generation Hispanic counterparts. Although the evidence presented indicates that first generation Hispanics gain weight, we do not find evidence for convergence in weight since the U.S.-born gain weight at a more rapid rate. The inclusion of community-level variables does not alter the relationships between the race, ethnicity, and immigrant generation categories and weight change. Of the six types of community characteristics considered, only collective efficacy is consistently and significantly associated with weight change, although the protective effect of neighborhood collective efficacy is seen only among women.

The historical context of power reversal when roles between the former dominant group (Russians) and the oppressed group (Estonians) have been exchanged provides a unique acculturation setting for the investigation of adaptation and well-being of minority youth. Historical developments constitute an integral part of the present minority group adaptation and interethnic relations in general in Estonia. The first part of this chapter describes how societal changes during the last decades have resulted in socioeconomic disadvantages and a lower well-being of Russian youth as compared to Estonian mainstreamers. Subsequently, three studies over different time periods are introduced examining determinants of subjective well-being (satisfaction) of Russian youth. In the acculturation research, subjective well-being or satisfaction has been conceptualized to be a part of psychological (emotional/affective) adaptation, which is situated mainly within the stress and coping approach.

Methods: We examined the association between nativity status and social ties using data from the Chicago Community Adult Health Study's Latino subsample, which includes Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and other Latinos. First, we used ordinary least squares (OLS) regression methods to model the effect of nativity status on five outcomes: informal social integration; social network diversity; network size; instrumental support; and informational support. Using multilevel mixed-effects regression models, we estimated the association between Latino/immigrant neighborhood composition and our outcomes, and whether these relationships varied by nativity status. Lastly, we examined the relationship between social ties and immigrants' length of time in the USA. Results: After controlling for individual-level characteristics, immigrant Latinos had significantly lower levels of social ties than their US-born counterparts for all the outcomes, except informational support. Latino/immigrant neighborhood composition was positively associated with being socially integrated and having larger and more diverse social networks. The associations between two of our outcomes (informal social integration and network size) and living in a neighborhood with greater concentrations of Latinos and immigrants were stronger for US-born Latinos than for immigrant Latinos. US-born Latinos maintained a significant social ties advantage over immigrants – regardless of length of time in the USA – for informal social integration, network diversity, and network size. Conclusion: At the individual level, our findings challenge the assumption that Latino immigrants would have larger networks and/or higher levels of support and social integration than their US-born counterparts. Our study underscores the importance of understanding the contexts that promote the development of social ties. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding Latino and immigrant social ties and health outcomes.

The aim of this study was to explore the differences in health locus of control and control beliefs between HIV infected patients from sub-Saharan Africa with and without a lifetime experience of migration. Methods: A sample of 62 HIV infected consecutive patients referred to the HIV clinics at the University Hospital of Münster (Germany) and at the Rubaga Hospital Kampala (Uganda) were enrolled into this study. We compared three groups of patients: sub-Saharan African migrants, German patients, and local Ugandan patients. We used the German health and illness related control beliefs questionnaire (KKG), the Competence and control beliefs questionnaire (FKK), and the Powe Fatalism Inventory-HIV/AIDS-Version (PFI-HIV/AIDS-Version) and translated these scales into English and Luganda. In addition, the patients' sociodemographic, acculturation, clinical, and immunological data were registered. Results: Significant results were shown in HIV related external locus of control between migrated sub-Saharan African and local Ugandan patients compared to German patients. General control beliefs showed no significant differences. In the PFI-HIV-Version, there was a significant difference between migrated sub-Saharan African and Ugandan patients compared to German patients. Conclusions: Our data suggest that the experience of migration does not influence the locus of control. Compared to German HIV patients, African patients in general showed a significantly higher external health locus of control which might have implications for drug adherence.

We examined the co-occurrence of anxiety and depression with prevalent physical chronic illnesses in a representative sample of Latinos with national origins from Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and other Latin American countries. Method: We used data on 2,554 Latinos (75.5% response rate) ages 18 years and older from the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS). The NLAAS was based on a stratified area probability sample design, and the sample came from the 50 states and Washington, DC. Survey questionnaires were delivered both in person and over the telephone in English and Spanish. Psychiatric disorders were assessed using the World Mental Health Survey Initiative version of the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI). Physical chronic illness was assessed by self-reported history. Results: Puerto Ricans had the highest prevalence of meeting criteria for any comorbid psychiatric disorder (more than one disorder). Puerto Ricans had the highest prevalence (22%) of subject-reported asthma history, while Cubans had the highest prevalence (33%) of cardiovascular disease. After accounting for age, sex, household income, number of years in the US, immigrant status, and anxiety or depression, anxiety was associated with diabetes and cardiovascular disease, in the entire sample. Depression and co-occurring anxiety and depression were positively associated with having a history of asthma but not with other physical diseases, in the entire sample. Interestingly, Puerto Ricans with a depressive disorder had a lower odds of having a history of cardiovascular disease than Puerto Ricans without a depressive disorder. The relationship between chronic physical and mental illness was not confounded by immigration status or number of years in the US. Discussion: Despite previous findings that link acculturation with both chronic physical and mental illness, this study does not find that number of years in the US nor nativity explain the prevalence of psychiatric-medical comorbidities. This study demonstrates the importance of considering psychiatric and medical comorbidity among specific ethnic groups, as different patterns emerge than when using aggregate ethnic measures. Research is needed on both the pathways and the mechanisms of comorbidity for the specific Latino groups.

Design: This mixed-methods study used standardised questionnaires as well as in-depth interviews among a purposive sample of 66 women who had migrated from Somalia, Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia or Sierra Leone to the Netherlands. Data were collected by ethnically similar female interviewers; interviews were coded and analysed by two independent researchers. Results: One in six respondents suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and one-third reported symptoms related to depression or anxiety. The negative feelings caused by FGM/C became more prominent during childbirth or when suffering from physical problems. Migration to the Netherlands led to a shift in how women perceive FGM, making them more aware of the negative consequences of FGM. Many women felt ashamed to be examined by a physician and avoided visiting doctors who did not conceal their astonishment about the FGM. Conclusion: FGM/C had a lifelong impact on the majority of the women participating in the study, causing chronic mental and psychosocial problems. Migration made women who underwent FGM/C more aware of their condition. Three types of women could be distinguished according to their coping style: the adaptives, the disempowered and the traumatised. Health care providers should become more aware of their problems and more sensitive in addressing them.

Perceived risk is a predictor for adopting risk-reducing behaviors. Despite the rising incidence of type 2 diabetes in Korean immigrants and their increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) associated with diabetes, little is known about the level of CHD risk perception and risk factor control in this group. Purpose. (1) Describe the level of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk perception and risk factors; (2) examine factors associated with CHD risk perception; (3) describe glucose control status; and (4) examine determinants of glucose control in Korean immigrants with type 2 diabetes. Methods. A cross-sectional descriptive study design was used. Data were collected from a community sample of 143 Korean adults with type 2 diabetes, aged 30 to 80 years old. Participants completed questionnaires and submitted to a finger stick blood test for glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), cholesterol panel, and anthropometric measures. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to evaluate factors influencing CHD risk perception and glucose control in Korean immigrants with type 2 diabetes. Findings. Perception of CHD risk among participants was low. Most (76.9%) perceived their risk to be the same or lower than their peers in the general population. According to American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines, CHD risk-factor control was suboptimal. More than half had uncontrolled blood pressure and higher low density lipoprotein cholesterol (55% and 53.6% respectively) than the target goal. CHD knowledge had a significant positive effect and self-reported general health had a significant negative effect on the perception of CHD risk. The mean HbA1c level was 7.6 % (SD = 1.5; range = 5.6 to 12.5). Less than half of the participants (41.3%) met the ADA's goal of less than 7%. Roughly 22% of variance in HbA1c levels was explained by a linear combination of family diet support, acculturation, body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), the duration of diabetes, the number of diabetic medications, age, gender, and education (R2 = 0.223, F[9,133] = 4.24; p < .0001). In the final model, family diet support, age, WHR, the duration of diabetes, and the number of diabetic medications determined glucose control.

Methods Interviews were conducted with 162 first-generation Latinas to examine the association of SES and acculturation with intake of omega-3 (n−3) fatty acids. Each participant provided dietary intake by use of a validated n−3 food frequency questionnaire administered twice, 4 weeks apart, three 24-h recalls, sociodemographic information and completed the 5-item Short Acculturation Scale. Results Mean intakes of Total n−3, α-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (g/d) were 1.2 ± 0.7, 1.1 ± 0.6, and 0.1 ± 0.1, respectively. After adjusting for energy intake, education was significantly correlated with EPA + DHA intakes, and acculturation was significantly correlated with Total n−3, ALA and EPA + DHA intakes.

Aim: To determine, among Filipino adolescents in Hawai'i, whether measures of economic hardship and lower socioeconomic status (SES) correlate positively with poor school performance, aggressive behavior, substance use, anxiety, and depression; and whether family support and cultural identification correlate negatively with these difficulties. Methods: 216 Filipino adolescents from four public high schools in Hawai'i (1993-1994) were given surveys that assessed basic demographic information, measures of family support and other social variables, and measures of school performance, depression, anxiety, aggression and substance use. Results: In the total sample, low SES seemed to correlate with poor school performance and behavioral and emotional difficulties. In both the total sample and the sub-sample of adolescents with lower SES, family support was a universally strong protective factor. Learning genealogy was positively correlated with school performance, and speaking a language other than English was inversely correlated with substance use (in the whole sample) and depression (in the lower SES sub-sample). Conclusions: For Filipino adolescents (in both the whole and lower-SES samples), family support was an important protective factor against academic, behavioral and emotional difficulties. The role of cultural identification as a risk or protective factor among Filipino adolescents deserves further investigation.

M.","Costs, needs, and integration efforts shape helping behavior toward refugees.",0,"not migrant","Recent political instabilities and conflicts around the world have drastically increased the number of people seeking refuge. The challenges associated with the large number of arriving refugees have revealed a deep divide among the citizens of host countries: one group welcomes refugees, whereas another rejects them. Our research aim is to identify factors that help us understand host citizens’ (un)willingness to help refugees. We devise an economic game that captures the basic structural properties of the refugee situation. We use it to investigate both economic and psychological determinants of citizens’ prosocial behavior toward refugees. In three controlled laboratory studies, we find that helping refugees becomes less likely when it is individually costly to the citizens. At the same time, helping becomes more likely with the refugees’ neediness: helping increases when it prevents a loss rather than generates a gain for the refugees. Moreover, particularly citizens with higher degrees of prosocial orientation are willing to provide help at a personal cost. When refugees have to exert a minimum level of effort to be eligible for support by the citizens, these mandatory 'integration efforts' further increase prosocial citizens’ willingness to help. Our results underscore that economic factors play a key role in shaping individual refugee helping behavior but also show that psychological factors modulate how individuals respond to them. Moreover, our economic game is a useful complement to correlational survey measures and can be used for pretesting policy measures aimed at promoting prosocial behavior toward refugees.

We investigated post-resettlement adaptation and mental health challenges of African refugees/migrants in Durban, South Africa. We interviewed 335 African help-seeking refugees/migrants for anxiety, depression (25-item Hopkins Symptom Checklist) and post-traumatic stress symptoms (30-item Harvard Trauma Questionnaire). Socio-demographic and migration history, focusing on post-migration circumstances and experiences of discrimination in the host country, were obtained. Association between migration and post-settlement factors and mental health outcomes were assessed using adjusted logistic regression models. Prevalence of mental distress was high: 49.4% anxiety, 54.6% depression and 24.9% post-traumatic stress symptoms. After adjustment for family separation since migration, recent arrival in South Africa was associated with increased risk for depression (aOR = 4.0, 95% CI:1.3–11.8) and post-traumatic stress (aOR = 5.2, 95% CI:1.7–15.9), while in unadjusted models, older age on arrival was associated with anxiety (aOR = 5.3, 95% CI:1.4–19.8) and depression (aOR = 6.2, 95% CI:1.6–24.3). History of family separation since migration was independently associated with depression and post-traumatic stress in all models. Discriminatory experiences since migration was also an independent risk factor for all three mental health outcomes. Finally, being divorced/widowed was associated with an increased risk for post-traumatic stress, while higher income earners were protected against post-traumatic symptoms, even after adjustment. Refugees/migrants in South Africa show a significant burden of mental distress that is linked to challenges of adjustment in an often hostile context.

We compared relationship standards in n = 286 Chinese living in Hong Kong, China, with standards in n = 401 Chinese migrants to a Western country (Australia) by administering the Chinese‐Western Intercultural Couple Standards Scale (CWICSS). We also compared these two groups to n = 312 Westerners living in Australia. We first tested the structural invariance of the CWICSS across the three samples with a multigroup confirmatory factor analysis. There was marginal but acceptable fit of a model of two positively correlated latent factors: Couple Bond (with four indicators, such as demonstration of love and caring) and Family Responsibility (also with four indicators, such as extended family relations and preserving face). Within the limitations of the study, results suggest migration is associated predominantly with differences in women's, but not men's, relationship standards. Migrant Chinese women show alignment of Couple Bond standards with Western standards, and divergence of Family Responsibility standards from Western standards. Discussion focused on how migration and intercultural relationship experiences might differentially influence various domains of relationship standards, gender differences in migration effects on standards, and the implications for working with culturally diverse couples.

This segregation by choice continues to expand beyond White and African American churches as recent immigrants see language and ethnicity as priorities in their selection of houses of worship. Despite these trends, there are a growing number of churches that reflect the ethnic diversity of their regions. These diverse churches face unique ethnic issues that require intentionality. This paper explores mindsets of both the foundational majority who have no choice in the matter and the incoming minority who chose diversity. The keystone of the investigation is an online survey of four hundred church members from Trinity Assembly of God, Lutherville, MD regarding issues of ethnic diversity. Included are: (1) perspectives on healthy ethnic diversity, (2) the degree of agreement with the church's stated diversity outcomes, (3) willingness to participate with various methods of embracing diversity, and (4) the climate of the church in regards to healthy ethnic diversity. Key implications of the project for the local church include: (1) Listening for unspoken issues regarding diversity, (2) affirming diversity through leadership positions, (3) clarifying for a Biblical framework for ethnic unity, (4) an awareness of racism in the pew. Leaders of churches desiring to develop healthy, Biblical models of ethnic diversity will find the survey informative and the recommendations helpful in their local church setting.

The instrument’s factor structure was analyzed via exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. The divergent validity of the MSLSS scores was tested with respect to self-rated measurements of affect balance and symptoms of trauma. The results supported a robust four-factor 14-item structure (RMSEA = .030; NFI = .973, TLI = .981; CFI = .985) with good internal reliability. The four factors were satisfaction with family, friends, school and environment and they were stable across age groups.

Little research, however, has explored cross‐cultural differences in emotion regulation in everyday interactions. Using a daily social interaction method, we examined whether people from collectivistic backgrounds (Chinese exchange students and immigrants from the Moluccas, Indonesia) living in the Netherlands differed from those from individualistic backgrounds (Dutch natives) in emotion suppression during everyday interactions. We also examined whether this depended on their relationship with the interaction partner(s). We found that Chinese participants suppressed positive and negative emotions more than Dutch and Moluccan participants and that this was related to differences in interdependent and independent self‐construal across the samples. We also found that Chinese participants suppressed positive emotions less in interactions with close others, whereas Dutch participants suppressed negative emotions more with non‐close others. No such differences were found for Moluccans. Our findings support the idea that people from collectivistic cultures suppress emotions more than those from individualistic cultures, but they also suggest that this depends on who the interaction partner is.

For this reason, immigration provides an exceptional opportunity for an examination of the role of cultural context in cognitions and possible changes in cultural characteristics. To this end, the present study examined the interrelationships between thought–action fusion, thought control strategies and OCD symptoms in three nonclinical samples, taking the immigration factor into consideration. Thus, the current study included three Turkish sample groups: those who remigrated to Turkey from Bulgaria, those still living in Bulgaria, and those that have always resided in Turkey. The findings of the study supported the role of thought and action fusion and control strategies in OCD symptoms in a cross-cultural context. To illustrate, worry, as a thought control strategy for OCD symptoms, was a common factor in all three sample groups. However, differences were also noted between the groups, despite having the same ethnic origin. Although they immigrated back to Turkey and have been living there for a considerable period of time, the Turkish remigrants retained similar characteristics to the respondents in Bulgaria on cognitions in general. Consequently, it may be suggested that cultural context might have a relative impact on certain correlates. A replication of these findings using different immigration groups and examining various cultural factors is strongly encouraged.

The paper draws on data collected through a survey of migrant workers in nine hotels in Northern Ireland and focus groups with migrant employees in all of the survey establishments. Issues of social integration within the workforce and the wider community as well as the future that migrant workers see for themselves are discussed from a human resource perspective.

Our investigation was grounded in the recent literature suggesting that cultural identity, adaptation, and the relationship between them are affected by contextual factors. We see the military in general, and the Israeli army in particular, as a highly assimilative context. We therefore predicted that national identity would significantly promote immigrant's adaptation. Three hundred and sixty-five young soldiers who had recently immigrated from the former Soviet Union and serving their compulsory military service in the Israeli Defense Forces, completed anonymous questionnaires. Our findings revealed that national identity was indeed positively related to adjustment, especially adjustment to the military setting. In contrast, ethnic identity was not correlated with adjustment. When classified into acculturation categories, according to Berry's bi-dimensional model, individuals in both the 'marginalization' and the 'separation' groups exhibited low levels of adaptation. Common to these two strategies is the rejection of host culture. Three factors--language abilities, sources of cohesion and goals in service--were examined as possible mediators for the effects of national identity on the immigrants' adjustment to military service. National identity was shown to affect adaptation partially through sources of cohesion and goals in service. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

This mixed-methods study conducted among Afghan and Iraqi refugee and asylum-seeker psychiatric patients aims to fill this gap. Associations between postmigration stress, symptoms of anxiety and depression disorders, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder were significant. When differentiated for the two groups, associations with postmigration stress were no longer significant for Afghan patients, who were predominantly younger and more often single, lower educated, and without resident status compared with Iraqi patients. Qualitative results indicate that, in addition to psychopathology and postmigration stress, acculturation problems contribute to confusion of cultural identity. The findings suggest that reduction of postmigration stress and acculturation problems may clarify cultural identity and as such may contribute to posttraumatic recovery.

Based on the theory of cultural values by Schwartz, it was tested whether cross-country differences in cultural value preferences can explain individual differences in negative group-related attitudes. Furthermore, the present article postulates that individuals with a migration background are less strongly guided by the cultural values of the society in which they live, because they are additionally exposed to cultural values originating from their heritage culture. Samples from 24 countries that were part of the fourth wave of the European Social Survey were examined. Cultural values were assessed using the Portrait Value Questionnaire. Group-related attitudes were operationalized through an index of attitudes toward four different groups. Analyses of hierarchical linear models supported the hypotheses: Participants’ degree of negative group-related attitudes varied as a function of the cultural values inherent in the individuals’ countries. Moreover, weaker effects were found for individuals with migration background compared to individuals without migration background, especially for first-generation immigrants and immigrants from culturally more distant countries. Moreover, country-level cultural values were found to moderate the relationship of individual education and income level with group-related attitudes. Results are discussed with regard to their contribution to the literature on acculturation and with regard to the validity of Schwartz’s cultural value theory.

A few cross-cultural studies have shown that the Western pattern of face-to-face communication is absent in traditional rural cultures, without identifying other processes that promote emotional Co-regulation. The present study compared three different samples: Western middle-class families in Italy, rural traditional Nso farmer families in Cameroon, and West African sub-Saharan immigrant families in Italy using biweekly observations of 20 mother–infant dyads from each cultural context from age 4 to 12 weeks. Longitudinal sequential analysis of maternal and infant behaviors showed that from as early as 4 weeks, in Italian dyads maternal affectionate talking is linked with infant active attention to mother in sequences of face-to-face contact; this link fosters the subsequent emergence of infant smiling/cooing, and then sequences of positive feedback between infant and maternal emotional expressions that, by the 3rd month, dynamically stabilize. In contrast, for Cameroonian/Nso dyads over the 2nd and 3rd month, maternal motor stimulation marked by rhythmic vocalizing is linked with infant active attention to surroundings. The relatively few smiling/cooing actions of Nso babies at their mothers were answered mainly with tactile stimulation that did not foster the maintenance of face-to-face visual contact. Finally, West African immigrant dyads showed a combination of both face-to-face and sensorimotor coregulated exchanges observed in their new and native cultures. These findings suggest that emotional Co-regulation in early infancy can occur via multiple, culture-specific pathways that may be substantially different from the western pattern of face-to-face communication.

Method: We used Smith’s (2003) theory of religious effects and Baron and Kenny’s (1986) approach for mediation analysis to explain the mediating role of social support between DSE and depression. The sample consisted of 200 elderly Korean immigrants who were aged 65 or older (mean age = 72.5, range = 65–89) living in the New York City Metropolitan area. Hierarchical regression model was used with SPSS version 17.0 to analyze cross-sectional data. Results: Elderly Korean immigrants in the present sample were found to be moderately engaged in DSE but not experiencing a fair level of social support. Respondents reported no depression on the average but 30% of them (60 out of 200 respondents) were experiencing mild to severe depression. Both DSE and social support were inversely related with depression, and the relationship between DSE and depression was mediated by social support. Conclusion: These findings are only suggestive and should not be generalized to a larger population. However, this study supports the importance of DSE and social support in the life of elderly Korean immigrants as a way to alleviate depression.

The results indicated that while there were no effects of age or education on overall BDI-I scores, those with lower education tended to report higher severity of individual symptoms. Consistent with findings in other populations, women endorsed a greater number of depressive symptoms. Therefore separate cut-scores were derived for men and women to represent these differences.

"691","Search2021","thesis",2017,"Lee, Jin Hee","Depression among Korean immigrants: The influence of acculturation and social support.",NA,NA,"Introduction: Depression is prevalent among U.S. immigrants, including Korean immigrants. However, little is known about factors that may contribute to their depression. Preliminary evidence suggests that less acculturated individuals are at greater risk for depression but that social support may buffer any negative effects of less acculturation. The aims of this study were to examine the relationship between acculturation and depressive symptoms among Korean immigrants and the moderating role of social support. Methods: A convenience sample of 132 adult Korean immigrants completed 6 self-report measures: the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, a Korean version of the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans-II, the Multi-Dimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, the Perceived Stress Scale, the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status, and a demographic questionnaire. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to examine the aims, controlling for covariates. Results: 31% of the sample met the criteria for being depressed. Greater acculturation was associated with more depressive symptoms while greater social support was a significant predictor of fewer symptoms. Social support was more strongly related to less depression among immigrants who were less acculturated than among immigrants who were more acculturated, but this difference was not significant. Perceived stress was the most significant predictor of depression. Older age at immigration and less education were also related to greater depression. Variables in the regression model accounted for 65% of the variance in predicting depression. Conclusions: Findings indicate a high prevalence of depressive symptoms in this Korean immigrant sample. Results also suggest that acculturation per se may not play a major role in depressive symptoms but rather more specific factors associated with acculturation such as age at immigration and educational levels. These factors should be studied in future research, along with efforts to better understand the causes of stress and impaired social networks in this population. Findings point to a need for regular assessment of depression by health care providers as well as the stress and social support available in a Korean immigrant's life.

First, we examined the underlying structure of daily hassles conceptualized as measuring general and acculturation-specific hassles. Second, we examined whether these two distinct categories of daily hassles significantly contribute to depression above and beyond the impact of premigration trauma. Design: The study was based on self-report questionnaire data collected from 895 unaccompanied refugees who had been granted residence in Norway. Results: Using structural equation modeling, the results confirmed the grouping of hassles in two general categories, which explained 43% of the variance in depression.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed, using an anonymous, self-reporting questionnaire. A total of 173 women were selected using a proportional stratified random sampling method. The relation between acculturation, depression, language literacy, life satisfaction and socio-demographic variables and the predictors of depression among participants were analyzed. The analysis included descriptive statistics and hierarchical multiple regression. Results: Of the participants, 9.2% had depression, which was almost twice the rate of depression found in the general Korean population. In hierarchical multiple regression analysis, acculturative stress (beta = −.325, P < .001) and life satisfaction (beta = −.282, P = .003) were significantly associated with the level of depression. This final model was statistically significant and life satisfaction, acculturative stress, language literacy accounted for 31.0% (adjusted R²) of the variance in the depression score (P < .001). Conclusions: Elevated acculturative stress and less life satisfaction were significantly associated with a higher level of depression in migrant wives in Korea.

However, other characteristics of elderly immigrants, such as the healthy immigrant effect, may counteract these potential risk factors. This study examined whether depressive symptoms differed between Chinese immigrant elders and their counterparts in China and whether health conditions were similarly associated with depressive symptoms in these two samples. Methods: Depression and health information was collected from 177 Chinese immigrant elders in Boston, the US in 2000 and from 428 education and gender-matched elders in Shanghai, China in 2003. Results: Chinese immigrants had a significantly lower score on the modified Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and its subscales: somatic symptoms and depressive affect. The association remained for the subscale depressive affect in multivariate analyses. Arthritis and back or neck problems were associated with a higher level of depressive symptoms among Chinese immigrants, while problems in walking were associated with depression among their counterparts in China. Pain was an underlying contributor to the association between depression and these health problems in both the groups. Conclusions: This study suggests that Chinese immigrant elders might be more resilient than their counterparts despite many challenges they face after moving abroad. With the growing number of older Chinese immigrants in the US, a better understanding of depressive symptoms is essential to provide culturally competent services to better serve this population.

Some studies have found, however, that CVD risk increases over time in immigrants and that immigration to a western country is associated with changes in dietary patterns. This could have unfavourable effects on the risk of CVD. There is limited knowledge on the food patterns, awareness and knowledge about healthy nutrition among Chinese immigrants. The objective for this study is to explore changes in food patterns, and levels of awareness and knowledge of healthy nutrition by length of residence among Chinese immigrants to Canada. Methods: 120 Chinese individuals born in China but currently living in Canada completed an assessment on socio-demographic characteristics, changes in dietary patterns and variables of awareness and knowledge about healthy foods. With ordinal logistic regression the associations between the quartiles of length of residence and dietary patterns, variables of awareness and knowledge about healthy foods were explored, adjusting for age, sex, education and body mass index. Results: More than 50% of the participants reported increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables, decreasing the use of deep-frying after immigration. Increased awareness and knowledge about healthy foods was reported by more than 50% of the participants. Ordinal regression indicated that Chinese immigrants who lived in Canada the longest, compared to Chinese immigrants who lived in Canada the shortest, consumed significant greater portion sizes (OR: 9.9; 95% CI: 3.11 - 31.15), dined out more frequently (OR: 15.8; 95% CI: 5.0 - 49.85), and consumed convenience foods more often (OR: 3.5; 95% CI: 1.23 - 10.01). Conclusions: Chinese immigrants reported some favourable changes in their dietary intake and greater awareness and more knowledge about healthy foods after immigration. However, an increase in portion size, an increased frequency of dining out and an increased consumption of convenience foods could indicate some unfavourable changes. These results suggest that health promotion strategies should build on the observed benefits of improved nutritional knowledge and target areas of portion size and convenience eating.

While most studies on immigrant integration have focused on objective integration parameters such as education, occupation and salary (e.g., Borjas in Friends or strangers: the impact of immigrants on the US economy. Basic Books, New York, 1990), subjective parameters have traditionally received less attention. However, in recent years it has become increasingly clear that subjective perceptions carry considerable weight in the social-integration process of immigrants (McMichael and Manderson in Human Organ 63(1):88–99, 2004; Massey and Redstone in Soc Sci Q 87(5):954–971, 2006). The study group consists of Jewish immigrants who arrived in Israel during the past two decades from two different regions of origin: Western countries, and the Former Soviet Union (FSU). All of these immigrants are generally highly educated and skilled, but they came to Israel from different societies and contrasting motives. The objective of this study is to learn about the integration of these immigrants via their satisfaction with life in Israel and to understand the factors that explain it, taking into account the differences between the immigrant groups. The findings, based on the 2007 Ruppin representative survey data (The data for this study was obtained with the support of the Israeli Ministry of Immigrant Absorption.), point to significant differences between the two immigrant groups under discussion. Western immigrants are more satisfied with their lives in Israel than FSU immigrants and have higher scores in most of the independent variables tested. The multivariate analyses for predicting an immigrant’s life satisfaction reveal that those reporting the greatest satisfaction are women, religious, with a high standard of living, with no academic education, and stronger Israeli identity (personal and as perceived by others). In addition, different variables play a role in predicting the life satisfaction for each immigrant group. This knowledge may be of service to Israeli policymakers dealing with the immigration and integration of highly skilled immigrants in Israeli society.

In Spain, migration has increased tenfold in 20 years. It is important to study how these migrants are interacting within this new context and which variables hinder their personal and social development. Aims: To analyze acculturation differences in Spain between first-generation immigrants from two different countries; to analyze the self-reported mental health of these participants; and to evaluate which variables best predict mental health disorders. Method: One hundred and thirty five (135) respondents from Romania and Ecuador responded to a questionnaire analyzing mental health by means of the GHQ-12, coupled with other personal, social and psychosocial acculturation variables. Results: Both cultural groups differed significantly regarding the impact of personal and social variables on their well-being. Nevertheless, mental health distress was not explained by their cultural differences but by gender, gross income and perceived discrimination.

Methods: We used the 2001-2003 National Survey of American Life, a nationally representative household survey of non-institutionalized U.S. Blacks to conduct descriptive and logistic regression analyses. Results: Older age, more health conditions, neighborhood medical clinic access, and health insurance were associated with higher odds of reporting a USOC. Odds were lower for men with lower-middle incomes and poorer mental health status. Having health insurance was associated with higher odds of reporting a USOC for African American men but lower odds among Caribbean Black men. Odds were higher in the presence of more health conditions for African American men than for Caribbean Black men. Conclusions: Health care reform policies aimed solely at increasing health insurance may not uniformly eliminate USOC disparities disfavoring U.S. and foreign-born non-Hispanic Black men.

A comprehensive overview covering different types of immigrant groups, different contexts, and various outcomes is, however, quite a complex task. Researchers around the world use different instruments, different conceptual approaches, and mostly do not replicate results across various immigrant groups. Therefore, in order to compare research results across Diaspora and other types of immigrants, we used a theoretical framework by Colleen Ward (2001) as guideline for describing different approaches to the study of acculturation and adaptation. This framework allows similarities and differences in three crucial aspects of Diaspora immigrants' adaptation to be addressed. In the second section of the chapter we discuss some limitations of current research and suggest ways in which they can be addressed by comparative research focusing on various immigrant groups. We also discuss the necessity to place more emphasis on developmental aspects in immigration research, which is of particular interest for adolescents, because in this age-group normative developmental processes (psychological, social, and biological changes) co-occur with acculturation-related changes. For this reason, we focus primarily on the adolescent years throughout the chapter.

It is important to better understand dietary patterns of immigrants because these patterns are associated with health risk. This study aimed to characterize dietary patterns of Mongolian immigrants in South Korea. Dietary intakes of 500 Mongolian adults living in South Korea were assessed using the interviewer-administered 24-h dietary recall method. By cluster analysis, three dietary patterns were identified: 'Mongolian' (26 %), 'Transitional' (43 %) and 'Korean' (31 %). The 'Korean' pattern had a favorable food intake profile, with higher intakes of healthy foods, while the other patterns had features of an unhealthy diet. There were significant differences between the dietary patterns that were related to risk for chronic diseases. Overall, subjects following the 'Korean' dietary pattern showed high adherence to World Health Organization recommendations for preventing diet-related chronic diseases, whereas the 'Mongolian' and 'Transitional' patterns showed low compliance. The results suggest the need for education programs targeting Mongolian immigrants who retain traditional dietary habits, to enhance their healthy food choices.

We compared the patterns of alcohol consumption in a group of Ghanaians living in different locations in Ghana and in Europe and examined the factors associated with drinking alcohol. Methods: Data were from a cross-sectional study (RODAM) of Ghanaians aged 25–70 years living in rural and urban Ghana and in Amsterdam, Berlin and London. Information on how often participants consumed at least one standard alcoholic drink in the preceding 12 months, the type of alcoholic beverage and the average serving size was obtained using a food propensity questionnaire. The associations between drinking alcohol and socio-demographic variables, and frequency of attending religious services were investigated using logistic regression models stratified by site and sex. For Ghanaians living in Europe, the number of years since migration and acculturation were also included in the model as covariates. Results: 4280 participants (62.2% women) were included in the analyses. In both men and women, the prevalence of drinking and amount of alcohol consumed per day was highest in Berlin (prevalence of drinking 71.0% and 61.7%) and lowest in urban Ghana (41.4% and 26.8%). After adjustment for age and education in both men and women in Europe, those attending religious services less frequently reported higher levels of drinking alcohol than non-attendants (never attend/no religion compared to attending service at least once a week men OR 4.60 95% CI 2.85, 7.44; women OR 1.80 95% CI 1.12, 2.90) p-trend with frequency < 0.001 in men; 0.002 in women); this association was seen also in men in rural Ghana (p-trend = 0.001) and women in urban Ghana (p-trend = 0.02).

The study focuses on 390 native Filipino, immigrant Filipino, and U.S. born Filipino American undergraduate students. Early research on acculturation has assumed that as people become acculturated to their host cultures, their own culture of origin weakens. Whether a group's cultural values and attitudes change may be tied to acculturation. For example, research has found that gender role expectations are associated with changes in core cultural values. Thus, this study utilizes the Attitudes Towards Women's scale to measure changes in cultural values. Changes in values due to acculturation may affect family dynamics, including family conflict, within this population. This study revealed that Filipinos do not follow the typical acculturation framework wherein the longer a group is in the host country the more acculturated they become. This study found that although native Filipinos did have the most conservative attitudes towards women, that immigrant Filipinos had the most egalitarian, even more so than U.S. born Filipino Americans who were expected to have the highest scores, because of their higher level of acculturation. The findings suggest that acculturation may not exhibit a clear linear progression as presented in past literature.

Methods: Logit models were used to assess contraceptive use among 1,830 women of Mexican origin in Cycles 5 (1995) and 6 (2002) of the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). Analyses were stratified by age. Initial models controlled for survey year and underlying differences across generations of migration in age and parity; subsequent models added a range of potential mediating variables. Models account for significant interactions between generation of migration and parity. Results: Among women under age 30 who have not yet had any children, women in their twenties with parity 3 or more, and women 30 or older with parity 1 or 2, those born in the US are much more likely to use contraception than immigrant women. For other levels of parity, there are no significant differences in contraceptive use across generations of migration. Generational differences in marital status, socio-economic status, health insurance coverage, and catholic religiosity did little to mediate the association between generation of migration and contraceptive use. Conclusions: Among women of Mexican origin, patterns of contraceptive use among first-generation immigrants and women of generation 1.5 are similar to those of women in Mexico, with very low rates of contraceptive use among young women who have not yet had a child. Further research is needed to investigate the extent to which this pattern is due to fertility preferences, contraceptive access, or concerns about side effects and infertility. Patterns of contraceptive use appear to change more slowly with acculturation than many other factors, such as education, income, and work force participation.

Using data from the 2003 Detroit Arab American Study, which is based on a probability sample, we examined the self-rated health (SRH) of Arab Americans by two measures of acculturation—immigrant status and language preference. We specified logistic regression models to test whether immigrants report better or poorer health status compared to U.S.-born Arab Americans and whether language preference among the immigrant generation accounts for the association between immigrant status and SRH. Our findings reveal that the health status of Arab Americans improves with acculturation. Arab immigrants are more likely to report poorer SRH compared to U.S.-born Arab Americans. When language preference is taken into account, Arabic-speaking immigrants are more likely to report poorer SRH compared to both U.S.-born Arab Americans and to English-speaking immigrants. We discuss these findings in light of similar ones obtained in the literature on SRH among other immigrant groups in the U.S. We conclude by arguing that language is an important measure to include in SRH studies among Arab Americans as well as other non-English speaking ethnic groups.

However, forensic measures are rarely based on normative samples that represent the considerable diversity present in forensic settings. The paucity of this research is particularly evident for psychologists asked to assess asylum seekers, where issues relating to diversity are central. The present study represents one of the first efforts to investigate the validity of measures of feigning, that have potential utility in asylum evaluations, in a non-Western sample. The study evaluated four measures that are commonly used to detect feigned psychiatric symptoms and insufficient cognitive effort, including the Dot Counting Test (DCT), the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM), the Miller Forensic Assessment of Symptoms Test (M-FAST) and the Atypical Response (ATR) scale on the Traumatic Symptoms Inventory, Second Edition. The study compared performance on these measures among three groups of West and Central African immigrants: honest participants with PTSD, honest participants without PTSD, and participants without PTSD asked to feign symptoms of distress. The data were used to evaluate the ability of these individuals to feign PTSD, to assess the classification accuracy of each measure, and to assess the effect of demographic variables and acculturation on these measures. When possible, the data were also used to derive alternative cutoffs scores that resulted in higher levels of classification accuracy than those previously established. Notably, individuals demonstrated difficulty feigning symptoms of distress. Using both published and optimized cutoff scores, no measure demonstrated high rates of both sensitivity and specificity, although the TOMM, M-FAST and ATR scale displayed valuable, but limited utility. The combined use of TOMM and M-FAST provided the highest rates of classification accuracy. No measures were affected by acculturation, as measured in the study, although the DCT was significantly correlated to years of education. The results emphasize the need for future research in this area.

This information was obtained by a socio-demographic questionnaire, the Schedule of Racist Events Modified for Use with Arab American Persons (SRE-AA), the Perceived Religious Discrimination Scale (PRDS), the Vancouver Index of Acculturation- Modified Arab Version (VIA-A), the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure - Revised (MEIM-R), the Family Assessment Device General Functioning subscale (FAD-GF), and the Index of Religiosity (IR).

Two VIA-A subscales measured level of acculturation and six variables were both taken together and used separately to measure perceived discrimination (PRDS subscales-Religious; SRE-AA subscales-Racial). Quantitative analysis found a positive association was demonstrated between VIA-A North American subscale scores and the combined subscales measuring perceived discrimination (SRE-AA, PRDS).

A negative correlation was also found between VIA-A Cultural Heritage subscale and SRE-AA In U.S. However, none of the variables in H2 mediated these relationships. Gender and number of years spent in the Arab world ultimately did not significantly contribute to the model. Qualitative analysis found several themes associated with discrimination and acculturation in the U.S. For example family integrity is an important factor in the lives of the participants, as is safety, freedom, and seeking out greater opportunities. Participants maintain lives in the U.S. and continue to adapt in their host culture despite perceived discrimination.

This article reports findings from a preliminary study that examined blood pressure and Epstein-Barr virus antibody levels in relation to self-reported indicators of stress, acculturation and social support among 79 adult immigrant Latino farm workers in Oregon, US. Findings show that increases in discrimination-related stress predicted elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) and Epstein-Barr virus antibody levels among male participants. Though female participants reported similar levels of discrimination stress, this perceived stress was not reflected in biological measures. Among women, greater English language engagement was linked to higher SBP, and more years in the US was associated with higher diastolic blood pressure. Study results suggest that male and female immigrants' physiological responses to stress may be influenced in distinctive ways by processes of adjustment to life in the US. If replicated, the finding that discrimination stress predicts elevated SBP may have clinical and public health implications given that elevated SBP is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

Integrating perspectives from social identity theory and acculturation research with a coalitional psychology framework, we show that an underlying mechanism for such bias is the perception that dual identifiers are disloyal to the majority group. In Study 1, majority-group participants in the U.S. questioned the loyalty of a dually identified Arab immigrant more than one who identified solely with the (American) majority group, especially under intergroup threat, which in turn predicted less favorable feelings toward the immigrant. Study 2 conceptually replicated the effect of the identity manipulation and the mediating influence of perceived loyalty on judgments about an immigrant being allowed to enlist in the U.S. military. Study 3, partially replicated the findings in Poland, focusing on Russian immigrants as targets. In Study 4, which independently manipulated both the identity expressed by immigrants and their loyalty, a dually identified immigrant whose loyalty to the majority group was portrayed as high was not judged as less qualified than an immigrant who identified only with the majority group for jobs with the potential to inflict damage on the majority group. Study 5, replicated and extended the previous studies in the context of fans of allied or rival soccer teams in Germany, revealing the moderating role of existing group relations on the hypothesized loyalty processes. In summary, coalitionally driven perceptions of (dis)loyalty appear to undergird bias toward minority-group members who hold dual identifications.

A mixed-method analysis.",0,"not English","Ataque de nervios (ATQ) and padecer de nervios (PNRV) are considered culture-bound syndromes with overlapping symptoms of anxiety, depression, and dissociation that are popularly endorsed among Latina/os from Latin America and the Caribbean. ATQs are acute experiences involving both typical and atypical panic symptoms, whereas PNRV appears to be a diffuse descriptor of nonspecific distress. These affective illnesses have inconsistent associations with mood and anxiety disorders, and vary in function and phenomenology by Latina/o ethnic group. Some researchers suggest that level of acculturation may be the most significant indicator of a tendency to present with ATQ/PNRV, but few empirical studies test this hypothesis. Through the use of mixed methods (i.e., integration of quantitative and qualitative methods), this two-study dissertation explores the extent to which ATQ and PNRV are culture-bound syndromes with identifiable signs and symptoms that are reliably associated with psychopathology and distress among a community sample of Mexican immigrant mothers. Study 1 examined the relationships between acculturative stress, U.S. American/Latino acculturation, anxious predispositions, psychological distress, and lifetime history of ATQ/PNRV. Study 2 explored the meanings of ATQ and PNRV among a sub-sample of respondents with positive histories of ATQ/NRV. In Study 1, survey batteries were administered to the full sample ( N = 82). In Study 2, a semi-structured psychiatric interview and a qualitative interview about general beliefs of ATQ/NRV were administered to the sub-sample (n = 22). Hierarchical logistic and linear regression analyses and thematic content analysis were used. Results from Study 1 indicate that lifetime ATQ and PNRV were related experiences that were not consistently predictive of distress, with the exception of PNRV which was associated with psychological distress. Acculturation was not observed to be a statistically significant predictor of ATQ/PNRV. Results from Study 2 suggest that ATQ and PNRV are not statistically associated with psychiatric disorder. There was also no clear and consistent majority consensus on the signs, symptoms, and causes of ATQ and PNRV. Thus, ATQ and PNRV are better conceptualized as interrelated idioms of distress rather than patterned and culturally-bounded experiences of psychopathology. Implications for the study of culture-bound syndromes and psychiatric nosology are discussed.

However, studies comparing health-related outcomes in homogeneous groups of immigrants living in different host countries are rare. In a sample of Jewish immigrants from the Former Soviet Union (FSU) in two different host countries, Germany and Israel, possible predictors of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and satisfaction with life (SWL) were examined. In total, 359 Jewish immigrants from the FSU living in Germany (n = 180) and Israel (n = 179) completed the questionnaire measuring immigration-related and sociodemographic characteristics. HRQoL was assessed via Short Form Health Survey Version 2 (SF-12v2), and SWL via Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). Hierarchical linear regression models were applied for analyzing immigration-related and sociodemographic predictors of HRQoL and SWL. Participants living in Israel scored higher on HRQoL, and no differences were found concerning SWL ratings. However, no direct influences of the host country were detected by predicting HRQoL and SWL scores. In both subgroups, immigration-related factors such as perceived discrimination or level of integration were found as significant predictors. In the face of different immigration waves in the host countries, Germany and Israel, the results display similarities rather than differences between the groups concerning the sociodemographic and immigration-related predictors on HRQoL and SWL. The findings using cross-cultural analysis level underscore the need of much more detailed future research on this issue.

One hundred and five forced and voluntary African migrants to New Zealand completed a questionnaire, which included two measures (a) the Psychological Motives to Migrate (Tharmaseelan, 2005) and (b) the Psychological Acculturation Index (Mace, 2004). Demographic information, including data on the New Zealand government immigration categories through which the migrant gained entry and length of time in New Zealand, was also collected. Multivariate analyses indicated that motivations to migrate do matter when it comes to acculturation preferences. Further, it was found that psychological motives to migrate were better predictors of acculturation preferences than the government immigration categories. Specifically, voluntary migrants (those motivated by ‘family life improvement’ and ‘exploration’) preferred to adapt to New Zealand culture, while forced migrants (those motivated by ‘escaping’) had a higher preference to maintain their culture of origin. Duration of time in New Zealand was correlated with acculturation preferences. Implications of the findings point to the importance of assessing motivations to migrate from a psychological perspective.

MANOVA showed a main effect of contact: majority members associated immigrants who were perceived to favour contact with more positive attitudes, empathy, trust, positive stereotypes and metastereotypes, and lower levels of threat. MANOVA also showed a main effect of culture maintenance: when immigrants were perceived to abandon their culture, majority members reported lower levels of symbolic threat and greater empathy towards them. A significant Religion x Culture maintenance interaction effect emerged on majority members’ stereotypes and contact intentions: Muslim immigrants who were perceived to abandon their heritage culture elicited more favourable responses than Muslim immigrants who were perceived to maintain their heritage culture. Taken together, these findings suggest that desire for intergroup contact amongst immigrants, independently of their religion, can promote harmonious intergroup relations with the majority group.

Drawing on theories of selective migration, this study tested the 'healthy migrant' and 'salmon-bias' hypotheses by comparing the health of Mexican immigrants in the U.S. to non-migrants in Mexico, and to return migrants in Mexico. Results suggest that there are both healthy migrant and salmon-bias effects in activity limitation, but not other health aspects. In fact, consistent with prior research, immigrants are negatively selected on self-rated health. Future research should consider the complexities of migrants’ health profiles and examine selection mechanisms alongside other factors such as acculturation.

However, little is known about the correlates of mental health indicators among these groups. The primary and secondary aims were to determine the association between duration of US residence and suicidality, and 12-month mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders, respectively, among racial/ethnic minority immigrants. Methods: Data were obtained from the National Survey of American Life and the National Latino and Asian American Survey. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the association between duration of US residence, and suicidality and 12-month psychopathology. Results: Among Afro-Caribbeans, there was a modest positive association between duration of US residence and 12-month psychopathology (Plinear trend = 0.016). Among Asians there was a modest positive association between duration of US residence and suicidal ideation and attempts (Plinear trend = 0.018, 0.063, respectively). Among Latinos, there was a positive association between duration of US residence, and suicidal ideation, attempts and 12-month psychopathology (Plinear trend = 0.001, 0.012, 0.002, respectively). Latinos who had been in the US for >20 years had 2.6 times greater likelihood of suicidal ideation relative to those who had been in the US for <5 years (95 % CI 1.01–6.78). Conclusions: The association between duration of US residence and suicidality and psychopathology varies across racial/ethnic minority groups.

Results from generalized linear models (GzLMs) demonstrate that acculturation was a significant positive predictor of asthma.

Yet little is known about the adequacy of the social safety net in responding to farmworker needs. Using data from the 2005–2009 National Agricultural Workers Survey (N = 10,469), the current study analyzed predictors of social welfare participation among Latinos, who represent approximately 80 percent of all farmworkers. Nearly 95 percent are immigrants, although almost half of them have lived in the United States for more than 10 years. Descriptive analyses showed that, even among farmworker households whose income fell below the poverty line or that were headed by legally documented individuals, social services use was very low. Logistic regression analyses revealed that degree of social integration influenced social welfare participation, controlling for education, poverty status, family composition, and employment characteristics. Latino farmworkers who were recent immigrants (that is, in the United States for less than five years) had significantly lower odds of access to social insurance and public assistance programs relative to their U.S.-born counterparts. Low self-reported English ability significantly decreased access to most social insurance programs but not public assistance receipt. The findings indicate the need for social workers to engage in outreach efforts and policy advocacy to improve farmworkers access to social welfare.

As hypothesized, results supported indirect links between economic and cultural adaptation stressors and spouses’ marital negativity and satisfaction: (1) contextual stress was associated with depressive symptoms, (2) depressive symptoms were positively associated with marital negativity for both husbands and wives and negatively associated with marital satisfaction for wives only, and (3) marital negativity was inversely associated with marital satisfaction for both spouses. Two partner effects emerged: (a) husbands’ depressive symptoms were positively associated with wives’ reports of marital negativity and (b) husbands’ marital negativity was inversely related to wives’ marital satisfaction. From these findings, we can infer that the psychological distress that arises for Mexican-origin spouses as they respond to the challenges of making ends meet during difficult economic times while they simultaneously navigate adapting to life in a new country is evidenced in their marital quality. Specifically, this study found that contextual stress external to the marital relationship was transmitted via spouses’ psychological distress and negative marital exchanges to spouses’ marital satisfaction. Wives’ marital satisfaction was shown to be uniquely vulnerable to their own and their husbands’ depressive symptoms and marital negativity.

Furthermore, stress associated with the migration process has also been shown to impact negatively on refugees’ mental health, but the extent of these experiences is highly debatable as the relationships between traumatic events, migration, and mental health outcomes are complex and poorly understood. Objective: This study aimed to examine the influence of trauma-related and post-migratory factors on symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety in two samples of Bosnian refugees that have resettled in two different host nationsAustria and Australia. Method: Using multiple recruitment methods, 138 participants were recruited to complete self-report measures assessing acculturative stress, PTSD, depressive, and anxiety symptoms. Results: Hierarchical regressions indicated that after controlling for age, sex, and exposure to traumatic events, acculturative stress associated with post-migratory experiences predicted severity of PTSD and anxiety symptoms, while depressive symptoms were only predicted by exposure to traumatic events. This model, however, was only significant for Bosnian refugees resettled in Austria, as PTSD, depressive, and anxiety symptoms were only predicted by traumatic exposure in the Bosnian refugees resettled in Australia. Conclusion: These findings point toward the importance of assessing both psychological and social stressors when assessing mental health of refugees. Furthermore, these results draw attention to the influence of the host societyon post-migratory adaptation and mental health of refugees. Further research is needed to replicate these findings among other refugee samples in other host nations.

In this study we tested the effects of four high-order values (openness to change, self-transcendence, conservation, and self-enhancement, devised according to Schwartz's model) on host community acculturation orientations towards immigrants (devised according the interactive acculturation model) in the public domain of employment and the private domain of endogamy/exogamy. Participants were 264 Italian University students, who completed a questionnaire containing the Portrait Values Questionnaire, a measure of personal values, and the Host Community Acculturation Scale, aimed at measuring Italian acculturation strategies towards three groups of immigrants: Immigrants (the general category), Chinese (the valued immigrant group), and Albanians (the devalued immigrant group). Results showed that personal values are related to the adoption of acculturation orientations: In particular, the values that mostly impacted on acculturation orientations were self-transcendence and conservation. Values concerning self-transcendence encourage the adoption of integrationism, integrationism-transformation, and individualism and reduce the adoption of assimilationism, segregationism, and exclusionism. Values concerning conservation encourage the adoption of assimilation, segregation and exclusion orientations and reduce the adoption of both types of integrationism and individualism.

Fifty South Asian immigrant women, ages 18-30, were recruited from university and community settings across the United States. A 2 x 3 within subjects design was employed. There were two levels of interviewer ethnicity (South Asian and European American) and three levels of topic intimacy (low, medium, and high intimacy). Participants were audio taped while responding to telephone interview questions of varying intimacy posed by South Asian and European American interviewers. The interviews were transcribed and coded for all explicitly verbalized disclosures, vocalized pauses, and halts in conversation. Participants completed four self-report measures, including a modified version of the Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identity Acculturation Scale (SL-ASIA; Suinn, Rickard-Figueroa, Lew, & Vigil, 1987), the Revised Self-Disclosure Scales (RSDS; Wheeless & Grotz, 1976), the Self-Concealment Scale (SCS; Larson & Chastain, 1990), and a demographics questionnaire (designed for this study). The results obtained were contrary to the predictions of increased disclosure and less concealment in an ethnically matched interviewer-interviewee condition. No differences in rates of behavioral disclosure to either the South Asian or American target were found across topic intimacy questions. An effect of interviewer ethnicity on rates of behavioral concealment was found, however, it was not in the direction predicted. South Asian women concealed more when speaking with an ethnically similar target. This was substantiated by evidence from self-report data indicating a greater preference to disclose personally relevant information to an American target than to a South Asian target. These findings suggest that an ethnic match does not necessarily facilitate disclosure. Rather, cultural differences in disclosure may be determined primarily by the characteristics of the target, rather than the ethnicity match of the discloser-target dyad. This interpretation is consistent with the literature on sex differences in self-disclosure, which indicates that target effects (e.g., more disclosure to women) best account for the observed variations across same-sex and opposite-sex dyads.

The aims of this study were to compare the performance of illiterate and literate immigrants on two semantic criteria for the verbal fluency test, and examine the influence of acculturation on test performances. Method: Performances of 20 cognitively unimpaired illiterate and 21 literate Turkish immigrants aged ≥50 years were compared on an animal and supermarket criterion for the semantic verbal fluency test. Also, the influence of acculturation on test performances was examined. Results: Significantly poorer performance of the illiterate compared to the literate group was found for the animal criterion, whereas no differences were found for the supermarket criterion that was considered more ecologically relevant for illiterate individuals. A significant interaction effect was found between the semantic criteria and literacy group, which was mainly related to a large effect of semantic criteria within the illiterate group. Adjusting for years of residence in Denmark and acculturation score did not affect this interaction effect. Conclusions: Overall, our results are in line with previous studies comparing semantic fluency in illiterate and literate individuals. The results lend further support to the strong associations between literacy, semantic verbal fluency performance and ecological relevance of the semantic criterion and extend previous findings to immigrants with different cultural experiences related to the acculturation process.

Considering that acculturation is a two-way process involving both the migrant and the host populations, research investigating the perspective of the hosts will enhance our understanding of the acculturation process. The purpose of the present study was to explore acculturation attitudes and perceptions of adolescents from the host population as a function of sport participation. Furthermore, for those adolescents participating in sport, the role of the sport motivational climate and its relation to acculturation attitudes was investigated. Design and Method: A cross-sectional quantitative design was adopted. Participants were 626 (316 girls) Greek, high school students (13.88 ± 1.01 years of age). Among them, 271 (92 girls) were athletes competing in individual and team sports. While all participants completed measures of acculturation attitudes, the athletes additionally completed measures of motivational climate, basic need satisfaction, and controlling coaching behavior. Results: Athletes scored higher than non-athletes on attitudes towards multicultural contact. Analysis of structural models revealed that a motivational climate characterized by a mastery climate, supportive of the needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness, was positively linked to attitudes favoring migrants’ maintenance of their culture and development of interaction with the host culture, whereas a motivational climate characterized by a performance climate and controlling coaching behavior was negatively linked to such attitudes. Conclusion: These findings provide useful insights concerning the perspectives of the host population regarding migrants’ acculturation and the role motivational climate play in promoting integration.

Migration, social institutions, and collective action in rural China.",1,NA,"This article integrates literature on social movements and migration to examine how migration shapes both the cognitive and social foundations of collective action in origin communities. Using longitudinal data and in-depth interviews from rural China, the author finds that outward migration spurs collective resistance in origin communities and shapes the form and scale of collective action. Migration fosters noninstitutionalized rather than institutionalized collective action, because it induces relational diffusion that empowers peasants to mobilize and employ more effective resistance strategies. This holds more for small- and medium-size collective action than for large-scale mobilizations, mainly because out-migration can also trigger community disintegration that inhibits larger-scale action. Furthermore, local social institutions condition the role of migration: migration has a stronger positive impact in close-knit villages embedded in strong lineage networks than in less cohesive villages. The author contextualizes the findings against the distinct institutional arrangements in China, which were originally engineered to disenfranchise rural-origin people but which instead have inadvertently politicized migrants and peasants alike.

Data were collected via computer-assisted telephone interviews with a random sample of Gujarati men and women aged 18–64 in Metropolitan Detroit. Using structural equation modeling, we modeled the effects of three components of enculturation (behavior, values, and community participation) on gender role attitudes and IPV-supporting attitudes among married respondents (N = 373). Analyses also accounted for the effects of respondent age, education, religious service attendance, perceived financial difficulty, and lengths of residence in the US. The second-order, overall construct of enculturation was the strongest predictor of IPV-supporting attitudes (standardized B = 0.61), but not gender role attitudes. Patriarchal gender role attitudes were positively associated with IPV-supporting attitudes (B = 0.49). In addition to the overall effect of the enculturation construct, two of the components of enculturation had specific effects. 'Enculturation-values' had a specific positive indirect association with IPV-supporting attitudes, through its relationship with patriarchal gender role attitudes. However, 'enculturation-community participation' was negatively associated with IPV-supporting attitudes, suggesting the importance of community-based prevention of IPV among this immigrant population group.

Furthermore, Berry (1997) proposed an acculturation framework and recommended that researchers advance the literature by examining the moderation effects on the association between racial discrimination and outcomes. The present results supported the moderation effect for Ethnic SC (i.e., social connectedness in the ethnic community), but not for Mainstream SC (i.e., social connectedness in mainstream society). A simple effects analysis indicated that a high Ethnic SC weakened the strength of the association between perceived racial discrimination and posttraumatic stress symptoms more than a low Ethnic SC. Moreover, although Mainstream SC failed to be a moderator, Mainstream SC was significantly associated with less perceived general stress, less perceived racial discrimination, and less posttraumatic stress symptoms.

Particularly in later life, when individuals face declining health and increasing dependency, patterns of attachment may relate to affective outcomes. However, few studies have empirically examined the attachment–well-being link at the end of the life span or considered whether ethnic group membership may moderate attachment–well-being links. Data from a sample of older adults (N = 1,116) were used to investigate how secure, dismissive, and fearful/avoidant styles predicted well-being in 4 ethnic groups; African Americans, European Americans, Eastern European immigrants, and English-speaking Caribbean immigrants. As expected, both secure and dismissive attachment dimensions were related to greater well-being, whereas fearful/avoidant attachment was associated with less. This positive impact of a secure attachment style of relating to others on well-being was stronger among African Americans and English-speaking Caribbeans compared with the European American and Eastern European immigrant groups. The negative impact of a fearful/avoidant attachment style of relating on well-being was buffered by being an English-speaking Caribbean but not for the other 3 groups. Results are interpreted in light of general and culture-specific premises of attachment. The article concludes with some implications and suggestions for future work.

Design: A questionnaire consisting of the following sections was submitted to 900 workers in Southern Italy: for individual and cultural characteristics, coping strategies, personality behaviours, and acculturation strategies; for work characteristics, perceived job demands and job resources/rewards; for appraisals, perceived job stress/satisfaction and racial discrimination; for subjective reports of health, psychological disorders and general health. To test the reliability and construct validity of the extracted factors referred to all dimensions involved in the proposed model and logistic regression analyses to evaluate the main effects of the independent variables on the health outcomes were conducted. Results: Principal component analysis (PCA) yielded seven factors for individual and cultural characteristics (emotional/relational coping, objective coping, Type A behaviour, negative affectivity, social inhibition, affirmation/maintenance culture, and search identity/adoption of the host culture); three factors for work characteristics (work demands, intrinsic/extrinsic rewards, and work resources); three factors for appraisals (perceived job satisfaction, perceived job stress, perceived racial discrimination) and three factors for subjective reports of health (interpersonal disorders, anxious-depressive disorders, and general health). Logistic regression analyses showed main effects of specific individual and cultural differences, work characteristics and perceived job satisfaction/stress on the risk of suffering health problems.

Similar to other racial disparity research, this study explored whether Black immigrants received less, equal, or more English learning services in comparison to non-Black bilingual students. Data was obtained from a sample of Florida middle school students of various ethnicities. A total of 125 surveys were distributed, 91 were returned, and 81 were usable for data analysis. Respondents completed a 14-item self administered survey, which obtained data on student demographics, racial/ethnic identity, English speaking and writing ability, as well as whether students were in an English-learning program. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the data. The results showed that there were Black bilingual students that were not receiving English-learning services. However, a Chi-squared statistic was calculated and showed that there was no significant difference in services received among bilingual speakers of Black descent compared to those of other ethnic descents. While this study revealed that officials showed practices of equality for both gender and ethnicity, there still needs to be practices and policy implemented to service English-learning students that are not receiving English-learning assistance.

We compare how natives respond to national insults that come from immigrants as opposed to natives. We focus on insulting the nation because it highlights the salience of national identity and clarifies the importance of group boundaries. We measure responses to national insults with vignette experiments from three original surveys in the United States. Our results are consistent with situationist theories of interpersonal interactions because they suggest that character evaluations are more dependent on the situational distinction between people who do and do not insult the nation than the demographic distinction between whether the insult comes from a native or immigrant.

Stage is a composite measure of tobacco norms of a country: smoking prevalence, cigarette consumption, and tobacco-related morbidity. The Lopez model characterizes the changing relationship between smoking prevalence and tobacco-related mortality and morbidity as a country progresses through the 4 successive stages of the tobacco epidemic. Methods: Survey data from Southeast Asian and Latino immigrants (from stage 1 and stage 2 countries) (n = 2,076) were used to evaluate stage of tobacco epidemic of country of emigration. Stage was compared with standard acculturation measures and community identification measures to understand post-immigration smoking behavior in the United States. Comparative analysis by stage and gender includes bivariate associations and logistic regression models to predict post-immigration smoking behavior. Results: Males: Pre-immigration prevalence and consumption rates of our study sample conform to prevalence and consumption of stage 1 and stage 2 countries predicted by the Lopez model. Post-immigration smoking uptake is equivalent to pre-immigration uptake for stage 1 males. The uptake rate for stage 2 males post-immigration is significantly lower (22.1%) than pre-immigration uptake (41.4%). Stage is a statistically significant predictor of post-immigration smoking uptake (OR = 3.08, CI = 1.82–5.22, p < .01). Females: Stage of country of birth is not significantly predictive of post-migration smoking uptake. Conclusions: The finding of stage to be a strong predictor of post-immigration smoking behavior among males provides a promising measurement tool. Prevalence and consumption of females in our study sample support the need for revisions to the stage model.

A demographic questionnaire was used to ensure that participants met the criteria for the study and provided descriptive information for the sample. Acculturation was measured using the Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identity Acculturation Scale (SL-ASIA). Personality was measured using the Personal Preferences Self-Description Questionnaire (PPSDQ). The results of multiple regression and factorial multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) yielded statistical non-significant relationships between acculturation and personality subscales. Acculturation scores were consistent with the sample's composition and represented a complete range of acculturation levels. A majority of the study's participants were first-generation immigrants. Twice as many males comprised the sample as females. Personality scores were restricted in range with an overrepresentation of Intuitive and Judging Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) types. Possible reasons for the study's results are discussed. Implications for the counseling profession are included along with recommendations for future research.

Faced with significant physical and mental health issues, children often rely on school nurses as their primary source for accessing health care. The purpose of this dissertation was to explore school nurses' lived experiences caring for newly arrived immigrant and refugee children in urban public schools. The study aims were to: describe the meaning of being a school nurse caring for newly arrived children; examine the impact of immigration on children's wellness and educational success; explore facilitators and barriers to health care delivery for newly arrived children; and describe school nurses' self-care needs. The dissertation generated three draft manuscripts. Manuscript One critically reviews the psychometric properties of the Demands of Immigration Scale. Manuscript Two describes the Refugee and Immigrant Youth Core Stressors Model and how school nurses can use the Refugee and Immigrant Core Stressors Toolkit (RICST) to assess the impact of trauma, acculturation, resettlement and isolation on newly arrived children's mental and behavioral health. Manuscript Three presents results of a qualitative phenomenological study of the lived experiences of (n=20) urban public-school nurses' caring for newly arrived children. Findings underscore the critical role of school nurses in caring for newly arrived children, many of whom have had trauma exposures related to immigration. Forming partnerships and forging alliances with families and community providers can help school nurses to promote children's health and safety which in turn impact their educational achievement.

The findings showed that young people found a way of allowing their Muslim and American identities to co-exist, and only a small minority of the participants seemed to experience identity conflict. While religiosity was the only predictor of Muslim identification, young peoples' identification with mainstream United States culture was predicted by discrimination-related stress and acculturative practices.

One strategy used by community development organizations to address these challenges is the development of farm entry programs that assist immigrants in beginning and sustaining farm operations in the United States. Organizations such as Cooperative Extension, resettlement agencies, and African mutual aid associations have developed beginning farmer programs that provide a supportive foundation for immigrant farmers to gain access to farmland, technical training, and markets. Returning to farming provides African immigrants with a series of benefits including supplemental income, food security, and social integration. Drawing upon social capital theory, this study offers a novel approach to measure the community and economic development outcomes of immigrant farming programs. In this mixed-method program evaluation, immigrant farming programs are analyzed as social networks that connect immigrants to technical training, farming resources, and community members who can provide access to markets. Data were collected through a survey of 112 agricultural educators working with immigrant farming programs across the United States. Data were also collected through case studies of a Midwestern program and a Southern program. The case studies include two focus groups and 20 interviews with individuals associated with the programs as participants, agricultural educators, and community partners. Regression tests were conducted to determine the social capital factors associated with well-being outcomes occurring through the programs. The models show that interaction outside of the program, and access to information are positively associated with well-being outcomes. Analysis of variance tests show differences between programs with African immigrant participants and programs with participants from other world regions. Programs with African immigrants tend to have more requirements to use farming resources compared to programs with immigrants from other world regions. Qualitative analysis found that female African immigrant participants have a lower levels of agency compared to male African immigrant participants. The study concludes with a discussion of recommendations for implementing and evaluating immigrant farming programs, as well as applying social capital theory to the field of agricultural education.

Many of these Latino immigrant youth face challenges, including living in poverty, exposure to violence, and acculturation stress, all of which lead to a need for mental health services. However, the literature has shown that 76.9% of Latino immigrant youth who have a mental health need received no services (Toppelberg, Hollinshead, Collins, & Nieto-Castanon, 2013). The K-12 public school setting is responsible for providing the majority of mental health services to Latino immigrant students who do gain access to services (Langley, DeCarlo Santiago, Rodriguez, & Zelaya, 2013). Latino immigrant youth accessing needed mental health services in the school setting in turn highlights the vital role of mental health providers who offer these services to students in K-12 public schools. Utilizing a qualitative multiple case study design, the researcher collected data using a basic demographic questionnaire and in-depth interviews with 6 school-based mental health professionals in 5 different Southern California K-12 public school districts. Guided by the theory of cultural competence, the researcher gathered data about personal experiences, training and professional development, and personal needs when working to support Latino immigrant youth in participants' schools. The current study revealed four major findings. First, mental health professionals stressed the importance of collaboration among all stakeholders---including school staff, community agencies, and students' families---as a key component of providing necessary and effective services to Latino immigrant youth. Second, mental health professionals identified two-way language barriers with Latino immigrant youth and their families as a major struggle. Third, cultural competency and empathy toward the unique cultural identity of Latino immigrant youth and their families was identified as a significant tool when supporting the mental health of Latino immigrant youth. Fourth, mental health professionals asserted that in their role as therapists of Latino immigrant youth, they require additional training and professional development that incorporates education about cultural assimilation and migration.

Research has not addressed ethnic minority women's vulnerabilities to PMDD. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between acculturation and PMDD. Methods: An analysis of acculturation and PMDD among 3856 English-speaking, pre-menopausal Asian, Latina, and Black women from the National Latino and Asian American Survey and the National Survey of American Life was performed. Results: The lifetime prevalence of PMDD was 3.3%. Nativity status, duration of residence, and age at immigration were significantly associated with PMDD. Foreign-born women (OR = 0.38; 95% confidence interval (CI = 0.21–0.68) and immigrants arriving to the US after age six (OR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.18, 0.62) were less likely to have PMDD, compared to US-born women, and US-born women/immigrants who arrived before age six, respectively. The likelihood of PMDD increased as the duration of residence in the US lengthened. Limitations: The diagnosis of PMDD was provisional due to retrospective symptom reporting. Statements of causality could not be made because the study was cross-sectional. Conclusions: A substantial percentage of ethnic minority women suffer from PMDD in their lifetimes. Exposure to American culture appeared to elevate ethnic minority women's likelihood for PMDD. The stressors that are associated with ethnic minority life in America—discrimination, poverty, pressures to assimilate, etc.—may contribute to ethnic minority women's vulnerability to PMDD, and clinicians should be sensitive to the special risks in this population.

This study explored the impact of acculturative stress on externalizing behavior problems (e.g., aggressiveness and delinquency) among 121 elementary, middle, and high school students in Gyeonggi. It analyzed the mediating effects of acculturative stress on externalizing behaviors using structural equation modeling with bootstrapping method. The results showed that stress experienced in relation to cultural adaptation indirectly affected externalizing behaviors through school maladaptation. This indicates that while acculturative stress itself does not directly affect the externalizing behaviors of children and adolescents with immigrant mothers, it does appear to increase the difficulty of adjusting to the school environment, and as the maladaptation worsens, externalizing behaviors may subsequently develop. Schools must function as a protective environment against externalizing behavior problems associated with acculturative stress.

Based on social identity theory framework, I propose a model that examines how immigrant professionals’ perceptions of career boundaries influence two important areas for establishing a satisfying career and successful social integration in Canada: (1) perceptions of career-based success (career satisfaction and career anxiety) and (2) subjective well-being (life satisfaction and regret for immigrating to Canada). I further propose that perceptions of career boundaries act on subjective career outcomes through the quality of employment individuals obtained and the salience of immigrant professional identity. Perceived characteristics were assessed (N = 227) at Time 1, and measures of subjective career outcomes, employment quality, and immigrant professional identity salience were obtained (N = 101) at Time 2, six months later. In addition to the survey study, 12 immigrant professionals were interviewed for an in-depth understanding of the career experiences of immigrant professionals and immigrant professional identity salience. The longitudinal design of the study provides support for the temporal dimension of perceived characteristics; immigrant professionals’ initial perceptions about the career boundaries still predicted their beliefs about career-based success and subjective well-being six months later. Also, the findings provided some support for the mediating effects of employment quality and immigrant professional identity salience on the relationship between perceived characteristics and subjective career outcomes. This study sheds light on the relationship between the perceptions formed by immigrant professionals of the obstacles that they face in integrating into their new labour market, the employment decisions they take, and the impact this has on their sense of career and life well-being. It also reveals the way in which subjects invoke the intersectional identity of 'immigrant professional' as a result of their experiences, and of the effect that this has on them. The findings can inform the practice of the various parties assisting the integration of immigrant professionals into the workforce, an ever-growing and not well-understood group of workers that populate many of today’s workplaces.

It was hypothesised that the level of shame/izzat associated with mental health would predict intention to access services when controlling for other, more established, predictors. Ninety-four participants were recruited from community UK centres and online sources. Results indicated that shame/izzat and biological beliefs predicted lesser intent to access psychological services, whereas higher levels of acculturation and education predicted greater intention. Further analyses suggested differences between people that had migrated to Britain and those born in the United Kingdom. Higher education levels predicted greater intention for all participants. However, shame/izzat and duration of habitation in Britain were significant predictors for migrant participants, whereas acculturation predicted intent for those that were born in the country.

Objectives: To describe the prevalence of alcohol drinking and examine factors associated with drinking patterns among immigrant women in Taiwan. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional questionnaire survey and data were collected from June through November in 2013. Convenience samples of 757 immigrant women were recruited across Taiwan. Alcohol use patterns during the past year were divided into abstinent, low-risk drinking, and hazardous drinking based on the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test. Measures included subject characteristics, exposure to cigarettes and alcohol, acculturation level, and perceived stress. Results: The prevalence of drinking during the past year among immigrant women was 29.9% (low-risk drinking 27.6% and hazardous drinking: 2.3%). Multinomial logistic regression showed that women who were employed, who smoked, whose husbands drank, and who interacted with Taiwanese friends frequently were significantly more likely to be in the low-risk drinking group compared with the abstinent group. Women who were divorced/widowed, who had low education levels, who smoked, and whose husbands drank were significantly more likely to be in the hazardous drinking group compared with the abstinent group. Conclusions: More acculturation in immigrant women as indicated by working and frequently interacting with friends in mainstream society was related to low-risk drinking behavior; adversities as indicated by loss of marriage and low education level were related to hazardous drinking behavior.

From the perspective of cross-cultural psychiatry, one of the most important cultural factors may be differences in the explanatory model of illness. This article examines the relationship of causal beliefs, perceived service accessibility and attitudes towards seeking mental health care. Method: The sample consisted of 1000 immigrant and refugee women from five ethnic minority communities in Toronto, including three Chinese Canadian communities (Hong Kong, mainland China and Taiwan), Korean Canadians and Vietnamese Canadians. Data were acquired by a self-administered structured questionnaire. Quantitative data were analysed using MANOVA, ANOVA and stepwise multiple regression. Results: The five ethnic minority groups of women differed in their explanatory models about mental illness and distress. In the full model where other variables were controlled for, the most significant factor predicting attitudes towards seeking professional help was perceived access for all groups except the Hong Kong Chinese. In the last group, those subscribing more to a Western stress model of illness had a more positive attitude towards seeking professional help, while those subscribing more to supernatural beliefs had a more negative attitude. Age and education were not significant predictors. Conclusion: Perceived access is one of the main factors that influence attitudes toward seeking professional help. Explanatory models may predict help-seeking behaviours if perceived access to such services is available.

Background: There is growing concern about how to provide the care required by an ageing population. Although elder care has usually been provided by family members, this role is increasingly being fulfilled by immigrant caregivers with no formal training. Design: Case–control study (burdened/non-burdened according to the Zarit Burden Interview). Methods: The study took place between May 2005–October 2009. Anonymous questionnaires were distributed to 110 immigrant caregivers and their corresponding older care recipients (n = 110), who were receiving care in their homes in Barcelona (Spain). The questionnaires included measures of burden, social support, quality of life and social integration, and items about the physical/psychological status of the care recipient and the nature of the care tasks. Two groups of immigrant caregivers were defined according to their scores on the Zarit Burden Interview: burdened (n = 55) and non-burdened (n = 55). Results: Burdened caregivers reported less social support, a poorer quality of life, and problems with social integration. Furthermore, 48% said that they lacked knowledge about the care task, while 44% had difficulty performing certain care tasks, which constitutes a risk situation. Conclusion: Burden among untrained immigrant caregivers may be reduced by improving their social support systems and quality of life, thereby helping to ensure the availability of the caregiver services, which society increasingly needs.

Few published studies describe the experiences of women of Mexican descent with a history of intimate partner abuse, specifically in terms of their process of disclosure of abuse. Methods: A qualitative research design was used to conduct this study in south Texas adjacent to the United States-Mexico border. Twenty-six key informants were recruited from two different sites. An open-ended approach with a semistructured interview guide was used to collect the narrative information from the 26 participants. Results: The findings illuminated that many factors hindered disclosure. Some of these factors included protecting their partners, avoidance of worrying their mothers, and fear of losing their children. Conclusions: The study may help healthcare providers to understand the complexity of disclosure by women with a history of intimate partner abuse and may help explain why women do not readily disclose their abusive situations. Clinical Relevance: This study on the disclosure decision process of abuse by women of Mexican descent provides some understanding on the cultural or situational factors that hindered or encouraged disclosure; ultimately this knowledge can help healthcare providers and others to provide for the woman’s health, welfare, and safety.

The data were collected through self-evaluation questionnaires, translation tasks and open-ended interviews both in English and Mandarin. Using a combination of life stories describing the participants' personal linguistic and social experiences in Canada and the results of linguistic assessments through different tasks, the study provides a detailed examination of the phenomenon of L1 maintenance and attrition among young adult immigrants from China. The findings of this study indicate that the three participants took distinct routes resulting in differential outcomes in their first language maintenance and attrition. Ethnic and cultural identity, and language attitudes and beliefs were identified as important internal factors. School discourse including teachers' attitudes towards immigrants' L1, peer influences and access to planned L1 educational activities both at home and in the school system were important external factors affecting the participants' L1 maintenance and attrition. The results provide support for the view that a collaborative, inclusive approach to education that involves not only immigrant students, but also their families, educational systems, and society in general facilitates young immigrants' bilingualism and acculturation.

Objectives were to evaluate the usefulness and feasibility of methods to assess the prevalence of food insecurity and child hunger, and to examine associations between child hunger and measures of socioeconomic status and measures of acculturation. Results indicated that 85% of households were food insecure, and 42% experienced child hunger. Hunger was more likely to be indicated in households using foods stamps, with lower income, and lower education. Hunger was also more likely to be indicated in households where the primary shopper experienced difficulty shopping and with language. Results are in broad agreement with those reported in other studies and highlight economic and information barriers to achieving food security. These data suggest that further study of food insecurity is warranted among recently resettled refugee communities resettled in the United States.

The last 15 years have seen a growth in research demonstrating increased rates of psychosis in migrant populations around the world, and in derivative literature exploring etiological hypotheses that might explain this disparity. The current study notes an absence in this literature of acknowledgement of the central role that culture, language, and transitional states play in both immigration and psychosis, which hampers a full and clinically useful understanding of what happens when these processes co-occur. To augment the literature, the author surveys topics such as anthropology's revisions to the concept of acculturation, postcolonial theories of cultural encounter and evolution, poststructuralist theories of language and meaning, and deconstructionist analysis of xenophobia's influence in the historical development of psychosis as a diagnosis, applying these to a more nuanced appreciation of the convergence of migration and psychosis. The review concludes explaining how interdisciplinary perspectives might play a larger role in guiding clinical research and training, and might allow for ways of thinking about psychosis that both improve patient care and help propel academic discourse on language, culture, meaning, and psychosis, the great conundrums of psychiatry and philosophy.

Frailty of older migrants has important implications for the demands placed on healthcare systems. Examining 95,635 Europeans in the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe, we investigated cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between migration and frailty at ages > 50 years. We examined whether associations differed by countries' level of healthcare coverage and access for migrants and tested mediation by home-ownership and citizenship. Cross-sectionally, first-generation migrants > 50 years old were, on average, 16.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.6, 18.2%) frailer than non-migrants after confounder-adjustment. This decreased to 12.1% (95% CI: 10.1, 14.1%) after adjustment for citizenship. The strength of association between migrant status and frailty was greater in migrants from low-or-middle-income countries, compared with migrants from high-income countries. Migrants into Northern, Western and Eastern Europe were 37.3% (95% CI: 33.2, 41.5%), 12.2% (95% CI: 10.0, 14.6%) and 5.0% (95% CI: 0.5, 9.6%) frailer than non-migrants, respectively, but migrants into Southern Europe were no frailer than non-migrants. The strength of association between migrant status and frailty was greater in countries with lower healthcare coverage and access for migrants. However, citizenship attenuated this difference. Longitudinally, migrants were frailer than non-migrants at 50 years old and trajectories converged over time until migrants and non-migrants were equally frail by 80–90 years. Our work finds no evidence of the ‘healthy migrant effect’ outside of Southern Europe in older migrants and suggests that acculturation is a key determinant of migrant health.

"794","Search2021","thesis",2011,"Hall, Matthew S.","From a world away to living next door: The residential segregation and attainment of America's newest immigrants.",0,"not migrant","As the immigrant population in the U.S. swells in size and expands across the geographic landscape, virtually every aspect of contemporary social life is being transformed, influencing natives' job prospects, the challenges faced by local schools, and America's ethnic mix and cultural identity. These and other issues are closely related to immigrant settlement patterns across U.S. neighborhoods. Understanding immigrants' imprint on the residential landscape is thus central to broader debates over how immigration impacts American life and how immigrants fare in their new home. This dissertation seeks to address this important topic by providing a detailed, yet comprehensive account of new immigrants' residential circumstances. Specifically, I use neighborhood-level data from Census 2000 and household-level data from the American Housing Survey to explore patterns and correlates of residential segregation and attainment for ten new immigrant groups. In sum, I find that the assimilation of new immigrants is clearly underway: Greater socioeconomic resources and acculturation are associated with greater proximity to native-born whites, lower residential isolation, higher-quality housing, and better neighborhoods. On the other hand, my research also points to a rigid racial/ethnic pattern with Asian immigrants being less segregated and occupying superior housing and neighborhood environments than Latin American and Caribbean immigrants. The extraordinarily high levels of segregation for black immigrants are especially disturbing and indicate the continued relevance of the principle of black exceptionalism. I also show that the fairly high levels of immigrant group segregation in established metropolitan areas are being reproduced in new and nongateway metropolitan destinations. Despite some of these troubling patterns, my analysis generally suggests that immigrant segregation does not translate into poor housing and neighborhood outcomes. While I do find that the odds of homeownership are lower for immigrants in segregated contexts, and that segregation is consistently detrimental for Mexican immigrants' residential attainment, segregation tends to have no effect or exerts positive ones on other measures of housing and neighborhood quality. All in all, this research points not just to the challenges faced by new arrivals in American residential life, but also to the clear signs that new immigrants are participating in the American Dream.

Through residential and school choices, however, prejudice also contributes to segregation. To shed light on this bidirectional link, we conducted two survey‐based experiments with stratified quota samples of German adults. In Study 1, respondents with less contact and more prejudice indicated a lower likelihood of renting an apartment in a neighborhood with a larger proportion of minority members, although housing quality and crime rate were held constant. In Study 2, similar results were obtained for the likelihood of enrolling their child at a school with a larger proportion of minority students. Building on these results in a computer simulation, we find that because contact only reduces prejudice, but does not produce pro‐minority preferences, spontaneous desegregation is unlikely to occur even under the most favorable structural and economic conditions.

We compared psychological distress between male and female immigrants from low-and middle-income countries living in Oslo, and identified factors associated with distress for men and women, separately. Method: A cross-sectional survey with self-administered questionnaires was conducted among 1536 immigrants from low- and middle-income countries living in Oslo. The Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-10) was used to measure psychological distress. Data on their sociodemographic characteristics, negative and traumatic life events, and social integration and possible discrimination in the Norwegian society were also collected. Results: One-fourth of the study population was found to be psychologically distressed, with almost equal levels among men and women. Lack of salaried job and recent negative life events were independently associated with psychological distress for both genders. Furthermore, experience of denial of job and past traumatic experiences were other associated negative factors among men, while visits made by Norwegians appeared as a protective factor against distress among men. Older age, Middle East background, living without a partner, and experiencing denial of housing were other associated negative factors among women. Conclusion: Our findings show that, except for adverse living conditions, there are gender differences with regard to factors associated with psychological distress among immigrants living in Oslo. Such gender issues are relevant for assisting immigrants in the integration process as well as for future research in migration and health.

Using data from the 2000-2007 National Health Interview Surveys, we compare health outcomes among immigrants to those among U.S.-born whites and assess gender differences within each group. We find an immigrant story and a gender story. Mexican and Middle Eastern immigrants are healthier than U.S.-born whites, and men report better health than women regardless of nativity or ethnicity.

A cross-sectional descriptive correlational design was employed and data collection included the following instruments: the Health Belief Questionnaire; Acculturating Rating Scale for Arab-American-II; Tobacco Use Questionnaire; plus a brief demographic survey. An integrative model of the Health Belief Model and Berry's Acculturation Model guided this study. Results showed that despite the increase in subjects' general health concern, tobacco use was still high. Subjects reported that barriers surrounding tobacco cessation were greater than the benefits of quitting, and those with lower levels of acculturation had higher levels of tobacco use regardless of duration of residency. The data supported the hypothesis that culture plays an important role in smoking behavior and health motivation. The Arab culture emphasizes both fatalism and reliance on God's will, but disease prevention programs in the US emphasize the individual's role in health promotion. Thus, culturally-sensitive tobacco cessation programs should be tailored to meet the needs of this high risk population.

We estimated the extent of positive and negative health selection through a unique series of questions asking immigrants in the United States to evaluate their health and compare it to that of citizens in their country of origin. Results: The extent of positive health selection differed significantly across immigrant groups and was related to compositional differences in the socioeconomic profiles of immigrant streams. Conclusions: The salience of socioeconomic status and English-language ability in explaining health differentials across immigrant groups reinforces the importance of further research on the role of these factors in contributing to the health of immigrants above and beyond the need for additional attention to the health selection process.

It turned out that immigrant adolescents, as compared to natives, are more often affected by psychosomatic symptoms, less satisfied about their health and about life, and less happy. A multiple regression model showed that migration itself is related to life satisfaction and happiness. Socio-economic inequalities, lack of social integration and victimization determine the differences between immigrants and natives in terms of health symptoms and self-reported health. Immigrant adolescents demonstrated worse health status then their native classmates. However, the differences in terms of subjective well-being are not explained by socio-economic differences, lack of social integration and discrimination.

There is evidence of ethnic inequalities in health and access to and use of healthcare but insufficient consideration of the importance of birth abroad and length of residence in the UK. This study examines indicators of health status, behaviour and healthcare use among mothers of infants in the Millennium Cohort Study, according to whether born in the UK or abroad, individual ethnic grouping, and length of residence. Our findings show there are both positive and negative health indicators associated with ethnicity, birth abroad, and length of residence and presenting results on a single factor in isolation could lead to a misinterpretation of associations. For mothers ethnicity has an important relationship with most health indicators independent of country of birth, length of residence and socio-demographic circumstances. Once adjusted for ethnicity and socio-demographic variables, association with birth abroad disappears for most health outcomes suggesting that there may not be an independent migrant penalty in health. There is a linear trend in decreasing health status with increasing length of residence but no independent association between length of residence and healthcare use. This suggests that while there are continuing barriers to good health for migrants in the receiving society as shown in other studies, factors important for one health outcome may not apply to another. Our findings challenge linear acculturation models for migrants’ health in showing that a linear trend in improving socio-economic circumstances for mothers in some ethnic groups is not always associated with better health outcomes or changes in health behaviour. Our results point to a need for a comprehensive collection of information and analysis for all categories of migrants for understanding patterns of and factors underlying health and use of healthcare.

Design: Two random samples of 1250 immigrants to Spain from Colombia, Bolivia, Romania, Morocco, and Sub-Saharan Africa and 500 native Spaniards, aged between 18 and 65, were recruited for this cross-sectional study. Several hierarchical regression analyses of ethnicity and PD on subjective mental and physical health (assessed using the health-related quality of life items, HRQLSF-12) were carried out separately for men and women. Results: Male immigrants from Colombia and Sub-Saharan Africa showed better physical health than natives, controlling for age and socioeconomic and marital status. The immigrants—except for the Colombians—had poorer mental health than natives, especially African men and Bolivian women. Socioeconomic status had no impact on these differences. Among immigrants, PD was the best predictor of physical and mental health (controlling for socio-demographic variables). African men, Bolivian women and women without legal status exhibited the poorest self-rated mental health. Conclusion: Clear differences in health status among natives and immigrants were recorded. The self-selection hypothesis was plausible for physical health of Colombians and Sub-Saharan African men. Acculturation stress could explain poorer mental health in immigrants compared with natives. The association between ethnicity and poor self-reported mental health appears to be partially mediated by discrimination.

Cambodian and Laotian American adults in the United States of America were approached to complete help-seeking attitudes and acculturation scales. T test and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to analyze the relationships between the demographic and acculturation variables, and attitudes toward seeking psychological help. Out of 270 target subjects approached there were 108 respondents. Of the demographic variables, gender was associated with favorable attitudes towards psychological help-seeking. As expected, women were significantly more likely than men to recognize the need for help, to seek psychological help, to be more open to discussing mental health problems, and have more confidence in professional services. Acculturation was more powerfully associated with help- seeking attitudes than any of the demographic variables. In hierarchical multiple regression, acculturation contributed significant unique variance over and beyond the entire set of demographic variables to openness to discussing problems and having confidence in professional help. The findings of this pilot study suggest that there are significant barriers to seeking psychological help among Lao and Cambodian Americans.

European Social Survey (ESS) data are used in multilevel models aiming to disentangle the effect of recession in the host economy from that of living through times of crisis. The existing literature does not point in a clear direction, but the use of acculturation perspective, along with the self-selection hypothesis, help to derive clearer expectations. Diverse pathways are revealed. In troubled economies, HSIMs succeed in increasing their access to paid work and involvement in organizations, but their life satisfaction decreases. In functional economies, the situation is reversed: Life satisfaction seems to have a protective role in relation to the slightly higher difficulties in the labor market and lesser civic participation.

Over the past decade, researchers and political commentators have observed an apparent retreat from multiculturalist policies related to a belief that multiculturalism has lost support among the majority public. Recently, however, based on analyses of the evolution of migrant integration policies, it has been demonstrated that multiculturalist policies were largely left in place. To investigate the effect of multiculturalist policies on public opinion, we use a multilevel analysis of three policy indicators (Multiculturalism Policy Index, Index of Citizenship Rights for Immigrants–Cultural diversity, and Migrant Integration Policy Index) and European Social Survey data in 20 European countries. Results show that multiculturalist policies, as measured by Multiculturalism Policy Index and Index of Citizenship Rights for Immigrants–Cultural diversity, and migrant integration policies more generally, as measured by Migrant Integration Policy Index, to some extent are associated with lower levels of anti-immigrant sentiments, while they do not affect public attitudes toward political institutions. Regarding political attitudes, especially respondents with higher education levels tend to respond in a more positive manner to multiculturalist policies than respondents with lower education levels.

However, the ethnic inequality in the distribution of scores declined across generations. We did not find compelling evidence that stratified education systems increase mean differences in competency between minority and majority students.

Methods: A total of n = 90 patients with different ethnic backgrounds from an outpatient consultation service for immigrants at the Hannover Medical School were investigated by the Hannover Migration and Mental Health Interview (HMMH), the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Frankfurt Acculturation Scale (FRAKK). Results: The majority of the subjects (84.4%) had a clinically significant depression. The extent of depressive symptoms was determined by the selected acculturation style (1) (F = 3.29, p = .025): Subjects with integration as acculturation style showed less depressive symptoms than subjects with assimilation as acculturation style. Furthermore, subjects with segregation as acculturation style also showed less depressive symptoms than subjects with assimilation. Conclusion: The results suggest that even when undergoing extreme emotional distress, eventually leading to mental disorder, integration, as an acculturation style, seems to serve as a protective resource and possibly prevents further decline.

The alternative weighting procedure distinguishes between temporary and settled migrants by using a question on household location in the Guatemala questionnaire that is not used in the MMP. Demographic characteristics and integration experiences of the most recent U.S. trip are used to assess the composition and representativeness of the U.S. sample. Using a composite index of migrant integration to compare the impact of alternative U.S. sample weights on point estimates, I find that although the U.S. sample is broadly representative across a range of background characteristics, the MMP sample weighting procedure biases estimates of migrant integration downward.

These are based on empirical work in three of the case studies of a recently finished EU 7th FP research project 'Shrink Smart—The Governance of Shrinkage within a European Context' (grant no. 225193, www.sheinksmaet.eu). For our analysis, we chose three cases from the project: Leipzig/Germany, Ostrava/Czech Republic and Genoa/Italy, because they inspired us to think about the issue that this article is concerned with. All three are old industrial cities with far-reaching de-industrialization experiences. Due to job migration, suburbanization, and steep drops in fertilely rates, population numbers in these cities have decreased, although to different extents. The results presented here stem from the various investigations of the local causes and consequences of urban population losses in various types of shrinking urban regions in Europe. The argumentation is a result of post hoc discussions on issues of social cohesion and governance. Thus, we have not been able to draw on a systematic comparative research design. The article therefore presents evidence-based theses for further work and discussion, rather than systematically elaborated comparative findings. By providing a necessarily selective picture, we cannot present an exhaustive picture of all three cases, but will focus on the issues that emerged as crucial ones in the analyses of social cohesion in these there cities. These issues are, in particular, the segregation of underprivileged groups, i.e. of groups with restricted access to the housing market, such as low-income groups of minorities, as well as demographic segregation. We will show that, in all case studies, population decline acts as a catalyst for socio-spatial segregation, leading to pockets of rapid change and decline: in the case of Ostrava, to an increased exclusion of the Roma population; in the case of Genoa, to a concentration of new migrants in the historic city centre and, in the case of Leipzig, to a simultaneous concentration of vacant housing, unemployed residents, and ethnic minorities in older working-class neighborhoods. In doing so, we provide a contrast to the United States context and hope to stimulate comparative debates and theory-building.

Prior research offers strong evidence that nativity and immigrants’ citizenship status shapes U.S. homeownership, but relatively little work has explored how immigrants’ legal status is connected with homeownership. This study draws from locational attainment and classic assimilation theories to develop hypotheses about sources of intra-Latino heterogeneity in homeownership. Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey data are used to contrast four distinct groups of Latinos: U.S. born natives, naturalized citizens, authorized non-citizens, and unauthorized non-citizens. Logistic regression results indicate baseline and residual variation in Latino homeownership based on immigrant citizenship and legal status. Of these, unauthorized non-citizens are the least likely to own their home. The results provide support for all three theoretical models, particularly the place stratification perspective. The results also point to the need for more housing studies that jointly examine citizenship and legal status.

Objectives: 1) Assess demographic and disease-related differences among U.S. Hispanics by country of origin, and 2) Examine the mediating roles of socioeconomic status and acculturation on disease prevalence in these subgroups. Design and Participants: Using data from the 2000-2005 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), we compared characteristics of Mexican-Americans with Hispanics originally from: Mexico, Puerto Rico, Central/South America, Cuba, and Dominican Republic (n = 31,240). We stratified the analysis by foreign versus US-born Hispanic subgroups and modeled hypertension and diabetes prevalence, adjusting for demographic and acculturation differences. Main results: The six Hispanic subgroups were significantly diverse in all measured variables. Prevalence of hypertension (32%) and diabetes (15%) was highest in foreign-born Puerto Ricans. After adjusting for age, BMI, smoking, socioeconomic status and acculturation in foreign-born Hispanics, Puerto Ricans (OR = 1.76 [95% CI: 1.23, 2.50], p = 0.002) and Dominicans (OR = 1.93 [1.24, 3.00], p = 0.004), had higher prevalence of hypertension relative to Mexican-Americans. Adjusted diabetes prevalence among foreign-born Hispanics was half or less in Cubans (OR = 0.42 [0.25, 0.68] p < 0.001), Dominicans (OR = 0.48 [0.26, 0.91], p = 0.02) and Central/South Americans (OR = 0.51 [0.33, 0.78], p = 0.002) relative to Mexican-Americans. Among US-born Hispanic subgroups, Cubans had lower hypertension (OR = 0.53, [0.33, 0.83], p = 0.006) and Mexicans (OR = 0.76 [0.60, 0.98], p = 0.03) had lower diabetes prevalence compared to Mexican-Americans in adjusted models. Conclusions: The prevalence of hypertension and diabetes varies significantly among Hispanics by country of origin.

This relationship was found in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses and held up even when the influence of sociodemographic variables, past political activity, and other forms of collective identification were statistically controlled, suggesting a unique and causal role of dual identification. However, there was no evidence that dual identification fosters radicalization or even political violence. The implications for social integration of politicization driven by dual identification are discussed, as is the interplay of dual identification and separatist identification that could underlie the shift from involvement in normative politics to radicalization.

We investigate informational (analytical and exploratory), normative (heritage and host) and diffuse-avoidant identity styles as predictors of identity commitment and identity outcomes (self-esteem, self-concept clarity and ethno-cultural identity conflict). Two positive and two negative pathways to identity outcomes were identified, which were fully or partially mediated by identity commitment. Analytical informational style and normative orientation to the host society predicted stronger identity commitment, which, in turn, resulted in more positive identity outcomes. In contrast, diffuse-avoidant and exploratory informational styles exerted negative effects on identity outcomes via identity commitment. Furthermore, identity commitment buffered the negative impact of normative orientation to the country of origin on self-esteem. Taken together our findings indicate that identity commitment plays a central role in identity reconstruction of new immigrants.

The integration of immigrant communities may be affected by social polarization and spatial segregation. How are these dynamics evolving over time? To what extent the different policies launched to tackle these problems are working? These are critical questions traditionally addressed by studies based on surveys and census data. Such sources are safe to avoid spurious biases, but the data collection becomes an intensive and rather expensive work. Here, we conduct a comprehensive study on immigrant integration in 53 world cities by introducing an innovative approach: an analysis of the spatio-temporal communication patterns of immigrant and local communities based on language detection in Twitter and on novel metrics of spatial integration. We quantify the Power of Integration of cities ±their capacity to spatially integrate diverse cultures- and characterize the relations between different cultures when acting as hosts or immigrants.

It is unclear, however, whether PA increases or decreases the longer migrants live in their host country. In the US, studies on immigrants’ length of residence in the US and PA are inconclusive and many studies do not adequately consider the role of socioeconomic status (SES). Using California data, we examine relationships between immigrant generation and physical activity (PA) among Mexican, Chinese and Filipino adults, who represent the three largest immigrant groups in the US, and the extent to which the relationships are confounded by SES. Data from the 2000 US Census was linked with data on adults 18 years and older from the 2005 California Health Interview Survey. PA was measured in three different domains: leisure time (LTPA), non-leisure time (NLTPA) and any PA. Logistic regression was used to examine whether a wide range of SES factors, measured at the respondent and neighborhood levels, influenced the relationship between immigrant generation and PA in all domains and in different ethnic origin groups. Generation was significantly associated with LTPA among Mexican and Chinese adults and with NLTPA among all 3 ethnic origin groups; however the nature of the relationships varied. After adjusting for individual and neighborhood SES factors, a positive association between generation and LTPA remained among Mexican adults, and negative association between generation and NLTPA remained among Chinese and Filipino adults. These results underscore the importance of comparative studies of immigrant generation and PA and consideration of SES factors to identify pathways linking generation to PA. In the context of increasing rates of chronic disease, the study of transitions in PA among immigrants will continue to be critical to promoting the public health of diverse populations in countries such as the US.

The study population was a representative sample of adolescents aged 13–17 years (n = 2,081, 1,055 girls) who lived in Madrid. Data were collected from November 2007 to February 2008 through a cross-sectional survey in which self-reported height and weight were used to calculate BMI. Overall, no significant difference was detected in overweight risk between the Spanish and immigrant adolescents. However, immigrant adolescents residing in Spain for 6 years or under did show a higher overweight risk than both the Spanish adolescents (OR 1.57) and immigrants who had lived in Spain for longer than 6 years (OR 1.98). Changes in lifestyle associated to a longer duration of residence in Spain seems to have a slightly protective effect on the risk of being overweight in immigrant adolescents.

We grouped our sample into 'visible' immigrant women of color and 'nonvisible' White immigrant women. As expected, visible immigrant women reported more experiences of overt discrimination and fewer experiences of ordinary privileges than did nonvisible immigrant women. The associations of belonging to a visible immigrant group with both psychiatric symptoms and satisfaction with life were each mediated through ordinary privileges and overt discrimination. The magnitude of the two indirect effects was equal for psychiatric symptoms, but for satisfaction with life, the indirect effect through ordinary privileges was stronger. After accounting for ordinary privileges and overt discrimination, the average score for satisfaction with life was higher for visible immigrant women than for nonvisible immigrant women. These findings suggest that visible immigrant women experience exclusion from ordinary privileges to a greater extent than nonvisible immigrant women and that this type of exclusion is at least as detrimental to psychological health as more overt forms of discrimination. Our findings demonstrate the importance of attending to discrimination of both visible and nonvisible immigrants and highlight the importance of ordinary privileges to immigrants’ well-being in their countries of destination.

The present research builds on this previous work by investigating the extent to which immigrants’ independent vs. interdependent problem-solving style moderates the relation between approach–avoidance orientation and social integration. Interdependent problem-solvers rely on other people to achieve their goals. This interdependence was expected to reduce the influence of approach–avoidance orientation on integration amongst immigrants. Immigrants to Australia (N = 137) completed a questionnaire that included measures of approach–avoidance orientation and problem-solving style. Participants also completed three measures of social integration: (1) proportion of Australian friends, (2) feelings of inclusion in Australian society, and (3) satisfaction with employment, accommodation, and life in Australia. Consistent with previous research, there was a positive relation between approach and social integration and a negative relation between avoidance and social integration. Consistent with predictions, problem-solving style moderated the relation for approach orientation: Only immigrants who were independent problem-solvers showed a significant positive relation between approach and social integration. The results are discussed in relation to Gable’s (2006) model of approach and avoidance social goals and motives, and the implications for immigration services are considered.

In addition, statistically significant differences emerged with respect to the types of activities in which the young immigrants were engaged. Community engagement can thus be considered related to immigrants’ well-being. The operative results are discussed.

Thus, the central questions follow: (1) How segregated are immigrants from natives, how does this vary across regions of the United States and across different immigrant groups, and what the broad determinants of this segregation? (2) Does immigration reduce the degree of residential homogeneity experienced by traditionally segregated native-born groups, in particular African Americans?

Although there is considerable empirical evidence that trauma impacts interpersonal relations, there is a dearth of research examining the association between adverse events and the initial social and cultural exchange experience, and whether this is associated with psychological adjustment.

Data were collected as part of a community‐based partnership.

Social media have taken an important step by allowing the users to communicate in their native languages online. Because of this new step, communication through social media has become easier for the diasporic people who lack language and communication skills in their host countries. The diasporic people can communicate with the members of the same diasporic community in the host society and also with friends and family back home by using their native languages. Diasporic people have various motivations for using social media including gratifications. This dissertation examines patterns of use of social media among the South Asian diaspora living in the U.S. In doing so, the study uses a broader framework of bridging and bonding social capital to examine how South Asian people in the U.S. maintain relationships with friends both back home and in their host society via social media. Moreover, the influence of language for socio-cultural adjustment of the South Asian immigrant people was also explored in this study. An online survey following a snowballing technique was conducted among 535 South Asian people in the U.S. The results found that bonding relationships are related to native language use in social media, information sharing about back home and frequencies of social media use. Bridging relationships are related to relationship maintenance with friends in the U.S. and frequencies of social media use. The results of this study show the English language preference is not related to cultural and psychological behaviors in social media. However, English language preference is related to home country media related behaviors.

In addition, cultural differences in the sex-based differentiation of gender roles were examined, along with an assessment of the possible mediating role of acculturation. Five-hundred and ninety participants (418 Anglo-Australians, 172 of Chinese background) from academic institutions and community groups in Melbourne, Australia were administered the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI), an individual-level measure of gender roles. Factor analyses of the Bem items showed similar factor structures for the two cultural groups, despite differences on their country-level indices of masculinity (Hofstede, 1998). Further, Hofstede's proposal that sex differences in gender roles would be more pronounced in 'masculine' societies was not supported, however both genders identified more strongly with masculine values/traits if they were Anglo-Australian in background, and with feminine values/traits if they were of Chinese origin. The possible role of acculturation in mediating these identifications was not established.

According to the assimilation hypothesis, Turkish immigrants to the U.S. should become more individualistic with increasing length of stay. Alternatively, the immigrant interdependence hypothesis proposes that the exigencies of immigration require retaining or increasing collectivist values and behaviors, especially the willingness to rely on others. Measures of individualism and collectivism were obtained from Turkish immigrants to the U.S., Turks residing in Istanbul, and residents of Boston. Bostonians and Istanbul residents differed primarily on vertical collectivism, which is the tendency to subordinate ones own goals to those of in-group authority figures. Immigrants’ values did not change with increasing length of stay in the U.S., refuting the assimilation hypothesis. When immigrants were compared to non-immigrants, immigrants endorsed stronger horizontal and vertical collectivism and more desire to both give and receive, consistent with the immigrant interdependence hypothesis. However, this hypothesis was not uniformly supported. Compared to non-immigrants, immigrants reported more self-reliance with competition, and more internal locus of control, indicating a sense of agency and responsibility. Findings are consistent with the view that immigrants adjust in complex ways to their new society, and may have different temperaments than non-immigrants.

Methods: This is a cross-sectional study using data from 17 countries in the sixth wave of the European Social Survey (2012), comparing subjects born either in the country of residence (non-immigrants, N = 28,333) or in a country not classified as 'advanced economy' by the IMF (immigrants, N = 2041). Depressive symptoms were assessed with the eight-item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Countries were grouped into three integration policy regimes (inclusive, assimilationist, and exclusionist). Linear regressions were fitted adjusting first by age, sex, and education level, then sequentially by citizenship, perceived discrimination, and socio-economic variables. Results: In all integration regimes, immigrants report significantly more depressive symptoms than non-immigrants. The gap is the largest in exclusionist countries (immigrants score 1.16, 95% CI 0.65–1.68, points higher than non-immigrants in the depression scale), followed by assimilationist countries (0.85 and 0.57–1.13) and inclusive countries (0.60 and 0.36–0.84). Financial strain explains all the associations in inclusive countries, most of it in assimilationist countries, but only a small part in exclusionist countries. Conclusions: Across most European countries, immigrants seem to experience more depressive symptoms than the population born in the country, mostly reflecting their poorer socio-economic situation. Inequalities are larger in countries with more restrictive policies. Despite some limitations, this study adds new evidence to suggest that immigrants’ health is shaped by integration policies in their host country.

Two hundred seven students read a scenario describing a physical assault committed by a North African woman. She was described as having one of four acculturation profiles (assimilation, integration, separation, and marginalization). The consequences of the assault were manipulated (low impact vs. high impact). Participants judged both the act and its perpetrator on different dimensions. When the aggressor had not adopted French culture and/or had maintained her original culture, the offense was explained by internal causes and was judged more severely, and the offender was judged more negatively and was perceived as having more masculine characteristics than in the other conditions. These results were particularly true for participants with a high level of SDO. SDO level also affected how participants rated the feminine characteristics of the offender. The acculturation strategy adopted by the aggressor as a factor not directly related to the act and SDO level played a crucial role in the way participants judged a North African woman carrying out a physical assault.

The 17 seminar participants all lived with host families while engaging in intensive Spanish language study at a university in the DR and simultaneously taking a graduate course on second language acquisition. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of data sources, including language questionnaires, an intercultural development inventory, culture portfolios, and post-seminar evaluations and interviews showed that participants developed empathy for immigrant students’ linguistic struggles, developed a better understanding of the language-learning process, and came to appreciate the complexity of culture and cultural adaptation. The study also underscored the need for teacher education curriculum to be more culturally responsive to the rapidly increasing linguistic and cultural diversity in the student population today.

Further, the study also explores the use of a mobile application (app) provided to the newly arrived migrants to use for pronunciation practice. The study involved 38 newly arrived Arabic speaking migrants participating in an introduction program of the Swedish language and Swedish culture provided by the Swedish government. The participants were divided into two groups: a control group who received training according to the traditional introduction programme and an experimental group who used a mobile app for pronunciation training as a complement to the programme. We applied a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods for data collection and analysis. The participants were interviewed about their use of mobile phones as well as recorded in a number of activities inside and outside the classroom to compare their language evolvement. In addition, surveys, logging of weekly mobile activities and observations were performed. The results show that the participants used a wide range of different mobile tools, both inside and outside the classroom. However, they used the mobiles mostly for communication with their family and friends rather than for communication with Swedes and learning Swedish. Further, compared to the control group, the experimental group showed an improved speech tempo and self-confidence in speaking. The study thus indicates that focused linguistic training with a pronunciation app is useful for developing spoken language skills, which can lead to improved integration. The participants expressed need and interest in having more mobile apps for both language and culture training.

These hypotheses were derived from the Canadian multiculturalism policy (Berry, 1984), and their validity has been assessed in a number of countries. Our goal was to evaluate these hypotheses in Russia (Moscow) and Latvia (Riga). We used sociopsychological surveys of two dominant groups (Russian Muscovites and Latvians in Riga) and two nondominant groups (migrants from the Caucasus in Moscow and the Russian minority in Riga) employing structural equation modeling. A sense of perceived security promoted tolerance toward other cultural groups in three of the samples. Perceived security was related significantly to multicultural ideology in Riga, but there was no significant relationship to multicultural ideology in the Moscow samples. A preference for the integration strategy among the migrants in Moscow as well as among the Russians in Latvia promoted their better sociocultural adaptation and had a significant impact on the life satisfaction of the Muscovites but had no impact on the Latvian sample in Riga. Our results provided some support for the effect of intercultural contact on the acceptance of others in three of the groups: the migrants in Moscow, the Russian minority in Riga, and the dominant group in Moscow. However, among the Russians in Riga, the relationship between contacts and perceived security was negative. The multiculturalism hypothesis was confirmed with the dominant group in Riga and was partly confirmed with both the dominant and the nondominant groups in Moscow and with the Russian minority in Riga. The contact hypothesis received partial support with both groups in Moscow and the Russian minority in Riga but was not confirmed with the Latvians in Riga. There was partial support for the role of the integration strategy in promoting sociocultural adaptation and well-being among the migrants in Moscow and the Muscovites. These findings require additional analysis of the sociopolitical and historical context in Latvia in order to understand the psychological outcomes of acculturation among the Russian minority there.

Compared to non-immigrants, FSU and Ethiopian immigrants' inter-group assertiveness was lower. Girls reported higher levels of inter-group assertiveness than boys. Each of the immigrant groups rates itself as equally assertive as the non-immigrant group and more assertive than the other immigrant group. Also, a difference between inter-group and intra-group assertiveness was found among the FSU immigrants.

Data came from a household survey (N = 1474) conducted in Beijing between May and October in 2009. Multiple regression techniques were used to model the associations between self-rated physical health, psychological distress, and migration experience, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. The healthy migrant phenomenon was observed among migrants on self-rated physical health but not on psychological distress. Different health status trajectories existed between physical health versus mental health and between rural-to-urban migrants versus urban-to-urban migrants. The study draws particular attention to the diminishing physical health advantage and the initial high level of psychological distress among urban-to-urban migrants. The initial physical health advantage indicates that it is necessary to reach out to the migrant population and provide equal access to health services in the urban area. The high level of psychological distress suggests that efforts targeting mental health promotion and mental disorder prevention among the migrant population are an urgent need. The findings of the study underline the necessity to make fundamental changes to the restrictive hukou system and the unequal distribution of resources and opportunities in urban and rural areas. These changes will lessen the pressure on big cities and improve the living conditions and opportunities of residents in townships/small cities and the countryside.

Further, I consider whether health behaviors and psychosocial processes lead to higher psychological distress for childhood immigrants in adulthood.

However, health behaviors such as these contribute less to psychological distress than do psychosocial resources. Additionally, longer duration of migration is found to reduce psychological distress when controlling for age at migration, thus suggesting the migrant health literature should examine age-salient life challenges at the time of migration, instead of continuing to use duration of migration as a proxy for negative acculturation.

The paper combines data drawn from recent large health surveys to identify how the weight of recent immigrants compares with that of native-born people, and how the likelihood of becoming overweight or obese changes with additional years in Canada. We find evidence that on average, immigrants are substantially less likely to be obese or overweight upon arrival in Canada. These measures converge slowly to native-born levels, but there is marked variation by the ethnicity of the immigrant. Since changes in weight will reflect choices with respect to diet and activity, the extent to which overweight and obesity rates change with years in Canada may reflect the extent to which immigrants interact with or are influenced by members of their ethnic group who reside in the same area. We find evidence that ethnic group social network effects exert a quantitatively important influence on the incidence of being overweight and obese for members of most ethnic minorities, tempering the process of adjustment to Canadian lifestyle norms that may be driving excess weight gain with additional years in Canada.

Nevertheless, inequities may exist; accordingly evidence is needed. Our objective was to investigate whether differences in healthcare utilisation in immigrants, their descendents, and ethnic Danes could be explained by health status, socioeconomic factors, and integration. Methods: We conducted a nationwide survey in 2007 with 4952 individuals aged 18–66 comprising ethnic Danes; immigrants from the former Yugoslavia, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Pakistan, Somalia, Turkey; and Turkish and Pakistani descendents. Data were linked to registries on healthcare utilisation. Using Poisson regression models, contacts to hospital, emergency room (ER), general practitioner (GP), specialist in private practice, and dentist were estimated. Analyses were adjusted for health symptoms, sociodemographic factors, and proxies of integration. Results: In adjusted analyses, immigrants and their descendents had increased use of ER (multiplicative effect 1.19–5.02 dependent on immigrant and descendent group) and less frequent contact to dentist (multiplicative effect 0.04–0.80 dependent on the group). For hospitalisation, GP, and specialist doctor, physical health symptoms had positive but different explanatory effects within groups; however, most immigrant and descendent groups had increased use of services compared with that of ethnic Danes. Socioeconomic factors and integration had no systematic effect on the use in the different groups. Conclusions: The Danish healthcare system seems responsive to health across different population groups. We found no systematic pattern of inequity in use of free-of-charge healthcare services, but for dentists, who require co-payment, we found inequity among immigrants and descendents compared with ethnic Danes.

The current study aims to assess alcohol consumption among FSU and resident Israelis five years later to determine whether the discrepancy in alcohol consumption stays consistent or reduces. In addition, gender differences in alcohol consumption among the Israeli society were examined as well, as a special case of socio-culture differences. The data came from the 2000 national survey of drinking in Israel. Of 5,004 Jewish Israelis, 532 were immigrants from the FSU who arrived since 1989, and 4,472 were resident Israelis. The FSU group was compared with resident Israelis, and males were compared to females on several drinking variables. Logistic regression was the principal method of analysis. Demographics and cultural variables as main effects or in interaction with FSU and gender were controlled. The FSU group was significantly more likely to report drinking in the last twelve months plus drinking in the last thirty days than resident Israelis. Women's reported drinking in the last twelve months was one fourth of men's and during the past thirty days was one fifth of men's. Further investigation on the associations between the success of FSU acculturation in the Israeli society and drinking patterns as well as attitudes toward women and gender differences in alcohol consumption may provide explanations for gender and immigration gaps in alcohol consumption.

Key themes were the importance of good hygiene, an adequate source of food and water, access to a regular source of health care, spirituality, traditional practices, and functioning well at home. All participants were familiar with the process and rationale for immunizations and routine medical examinations; few understood cancer screening services.

Some of the determinants of access to care are knowledge and perceptions of dementia, which may vary between ethnic groups in the population. The aims of this study were to compare knowledge and perceptions of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) among four ethnic groups in Copenhagen, Denmark, and to assess the influence of education and acculturation. Methods: Quantitative survey data from 260 participants were analyzed: 100 native Danish, and 47 Polish, 51 Turkish, and 62 Pakistani immigrants. Knowledge and perceptions of dementia and AD were assessed with the Dementia Knowledge Questionnaire (DKQ) supplemented with two questions from the Alzheimer’s Disease Awareness Test (ADAT). Knowledge and perceptions of dementia and AD in the four groups were compared, and the influence of education and acculturation was assessed. Results: Group differences were found on the DKQ total score as well as all sub-domains. Turkish and Pakistani people were most likely to hold normalizing and stigmatizing views of AD. Level of education and acculturation had limited influence on dementia knowledge, accounting for 22% of the variance at most and had only minor influence on perceptions of AD. Conclusions: Lacking knowledge and certain perceptions of dementia and AD may hamper access to services in some ethnic minority groups. Ongoing efforts to raise awareness that dementia and AD are not part of normal aging, particularly among Turkish and Pakistani communities, should be a high priority for educational outreach.

In addition to the nature of the relationships between the constructs, the ways in which they are experienced by adult English learners were also investigated. Three inventories were adapted for delivery via a multimedia website. The English Language Anxiety Scale (Pappamihiel, 1999) adapted from the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (Horwitz, Horwitz & Cope, 1986) was adapted for measuring anxiety. The Stephenson Multigroup Acculturation Scale (1999) was selected for measuring the degree of acculturation, and the Multidimensional Acculturative Stress Inventory (Rodriguez, Myers, Bingham Mira, Flores, & Garcia-Hernandez, 2002) was selected for measuring acculturative stress. From the ninety-five original surveys that were begun on the website, fifty-five cases were selected for analysis. Results showed no significant correlations between the major constructs; however, interesting correlations among various individual items in the scales existed. Additionally, combined with the analysis of six semi-structured interviews, results indicate that the concept of foreign language classroom anxiety should be moved beyond the perimeter of the classroom for the case of adult immigrants learning English in an English-speaking country. Results further indicate that language acquisition in the adopted country when accompanied by the regular processes of acculturation may produce higher levels of language anxiety, not only in the degree of anxiety but also in the proportion of students dealing with anxiety when speaking English. The construct of language acculturation anxiety is proposed to identify the combined effect of language anxiety, acculturation, and acculturative stress. Implications for the instruction of adult English students are made, as well as recommendations for future studies, including considerations when using a computer mediated delivery with this population.

In addition to quantitative data, interviews provided insights into the participants' views and opinions on their language and culture and were used to supplement the statistical results with personal comments. The results indicate a surprisingly high level of first language and culture maintenance in the younger group together with highly successful L2 acquisition and acculturation, marking this group as rather balanced bilingually and bi-culturally.

Psychological and psycholinguistic research demonstrates that the language of administration may influence responses through its impact on various cognitive processes and through the cultural frame that a language brings to the conversational context. This dissertation examines the extent to which language of administration influences bilingual bicultural respondents' answers to survey questions. It consists of three related essays. The first proposes a framework for possible language influences at each step of the response formation process, based on findings from psycholinguistics and cross-cultural psychology. The second examines the existence of language effects in observational data from the New Immigrant Survey. It compares groups of questions where language effects are expected based on divergent view points of the two cultures under study (Hispanic vs. American) and groups of questions where no such effects were expected. The absence of random assignment to language of interview is addressed through the use of a propensity score method. The last essay presents analyses of an experimental assignment of bilingual respondents to language of survey administration in the National Latino and Asian American Study, comparing questions on similar topics as the ones examined in the observational study. Overall, the empirical investigation fails to detect strong language influences. Consistent with the proposed hypotheses, significant differences between language groups are found in questions related to alcohol consumption and family pride. Surprisingly, no language effects are detected in questions related to physical and mental health, family cohesion and family conflict. Various factors may explain the lack of strong language effects in this investigation - acculturation and level of bilingualism of the sample, interviewer and survey design characteristics, and unobservable factors not accounted in the propensity models are the most obvious. The existence of some language effects, however, requires further investigation of the conditions and mechanisms that produce them.

In-depth interviews were conducted with 49 sexually active men aged 18 to 30 years who recently immigrated to the United States. Findings from content analysis identified multiple overlapping individual-level barriers, including lack of knowledge, perception of personal risk for unintended pregnancy and STIs, and fear of disease. On a service delivery level, structural factors and the importance of confianza when interacting with providers and clinic staff were dominant themes. The majority of these themes were grounded in a cultural context and linked to men’s cultural background, beliefs, and experiences. Examining the needs of immigrant Latino men through this cultural lens may be critically important for improving access and use of sexual and reproductive health services.

It has been hypothesized that women's relative lack of power in relationships may be associated with higher risk sexual behavior. We examined the relationship between higher risk sexual behavior and perceived locus of control in sexual relationships among a sample of Puerto Rican and Mexican women. We interviewed 71 women of self-reported Mexican ethnicity in San Diego, California, and 79 women of self-reported Puerto Rican ethnicity in Cleveland, Ohio, to examine the relationship between HIV risk, HIV knowledge, and locus of control. Univariate logistic regression indicates that among Puerto Rican women, the perception that locus of control in a sexual relationship resides in the male partner was significantly associated with increased HIV risk, while younger age was significantly associated with increased risk among Mexican women only. In a combined sample of both Puerto Rican and Mexican women, multiple logistic regression analysis indicates that younger age, increased length of residence in the United States, and an other-focused locus of control are significantly associated with increased HIV risk. Women who have been in the United States for relatively longer periods of time may be more likely to integrate U.S. sexual norms into their own behavior and may, as a consequence, be at higher risk of HIV infection. Increased HIV prevention efforts must be made available to Mexican and Puerto Rican women born outside of the United States. These prevention efforts must necessarily focus not only on HIV prevention strategies, but also on the dynamics within male-female intimate relations. Increased attention to younger Puerto Rican and Mexican women is also needed.

The present study examined longitudinal relations between acculturative stress and endorsement of traditional Latina gender role beliefs (i.e., marianismo). We determined strength of the relations and temporal precedence of acculturative stress and endorsement of marianismo across 3 time points during participants’ initial 3 years in the United States using a random intercept cross-lagged panel model. Participants were 530 Latina young adult women (ages 18–23) recruited from Miami-Dade County, Florida. Results suggested that acculturative stress levels at Time 1 positively predicted endorsement of the Family Pillar belief at Time 2, but acculturative stress levels at Time 2 negatively predicted the Virtuous and Chaste and Subordinate to Others beliefs at Time 3. In terms of marianismo beliefs predicting acculturative stress levels over time, the Virtuous and Chaste belief at Time 1 positively predicted acculturative stress at Time 2, and the Silencing Self to Maintain Harmony belief at Time 2 positively predicted acculturative stress at Time 3. Findings suggest that the Family Pillar belief, or feeling responsibility for the family’s unity, may be protective against acculturative stress over time. Endorsing certain gender role beliefs (i.e., Virtuous and Chaste, Subordinate to Others) may lead to greater acculturative stress, and Latina young adult women experiencing acculturative stress may alter their endorsement of marianismo beliefs in an attempt to resolve culturally conflicting stress experienced after immigration.

We examined cross-sectional survey data for Cambodian refugee and immigrant women 35 to 60 years old (n = 160) from an established refugee community in Lowell, Massachusetts, to examine the potential contributors to health behaviors and outcomes among refugees and immigrants postresettlement. In our representative sample, we found that smoking and betel nut use were very low (4% each). Fewer than 50% of respondents walked for at least 10 minutes on 2 or more days/week. Using World Health Organization standards for overweight/obese for Asians, 73% of respondents were overweight/obese and 56% were obese, indicating increased risk of chronic disease. Depression was also high in this sample (41%). In multivariate models, higher acculturation and age were associated with walking more often; lower education and higher acculturation were related to higher weight; and being divorced/separated or widowed and being older were related to higher risk of depression.

Yet there is a paucity of scientific information about masturbatory behavior and feelings. Much of the available information is either from clinic-based studies or from studies involving young Indians. Methods: The present study, using a community sample of Indian men in Australia, aimed to explore their masturbatory behavior and feelings. Results: Overall, 268 men took part in an online survey, and 221 of these men completed the section on masturbation. Some demographic characteristics of the study sample were comparable to those of the Indian community in Australia. A large proportion (n = 174, 79%) reported that they currently masturbate, while the rest said they never masturbated (n = 9, 4%) or did masturbate in the past but not at present (n = 38, 17%). Among those who currently masturbate, the mean age of onset of masturbation was 14.9 years. Married men tended to masturbate less frequently than unmarried men. The most common mode, source of stimuli, and reason for masturbation were using hands (n = 162, 95%), watching erotic material on the Internet (n = 136, 81%), and to gain pleasure (n = 137, 79%), respectively. A high proportion (n = 114, 66%) of Indian men who currently masturbate said that they experienced positive feelings when masturbating. Conclusions: Masturbatory feelings of Indian men were found to differ by length of residence in Australia but not by degree of acculturation or age.

Immigrants' health is commonly expected to converge with the host population through acculturation. The aim of this analysis was to examine whether mothers' acculturation is associated with less-rapid weight gain in NZ Pacific children, and whether this differs by mothers' nativity. Methods: In a birth cohort of 1249 children followed 2000–2011, birth weight and weight and standing height, measured at years 2, 4, 6, 9, and 11, were quantified as sex- and age-specific weight (weight-for-age; WFA) and BMI z-scores. Maternal acculturation (range, 11–54) was assessed at baseline and years 4, 6, and 11. Results: In adjusted models using generalized estimating equations to account for repeated measures, maternal acculturation was not significantly associated with children's WFA or BMI z-scores overall. In stratified analyses, change in maternal acculturation score was inversely associated with WFA z-score change among children of NZ-born, but not immigrant, mothers (beta = −0.021; 95% confidence interval, −0.036 to −0.007; p = 0.006; interaction, p = 0.005). Conclusions: Our study provides the first evidence in a longitudinal sample that changes in maternal acculturation can influence children's growth, suggesting the importance of lifestyle or behavioral factors related to a mother's cultural orientation. Given the high risk of obesity and its related conditions in the NZ Pacific population, critical next steps are to identify mediating factors, as well as to understand the processes influencing growth among children of immigrant mothers.

Evidence from the American Time Use Survey.",1,NA,"Employment is a major factor underlying im/migration patterns. Unfortunately, lower diet quality and higher rates of obesity appear to be unintended consequences of moving to the US. Changes in food preparation practices may be a factor underlying dietary acculturation. The relationships between employment, acculturation, and food-related time use in Hispanic families have received relatively little attention.We used cross-sectional data collected from Hispanic mothers (ages 18–65) with at least one child < 13 years old participating in the 2003–2011 American Time Use Survey (n = 3622) to estimate the relationship between employment, acculturation (US-born vs. im/migrant), and time spent in food preparation and family dinner. Regression models were estimated separately for the employed and the non-working and were adjusted for Hispanic origin group, socio-demographic and household characteristics. Working an eight-hour day was associated with spending 38 fewer minutes in food preparation (−38.0 ± SE 4.8, p < 001). Although being US-born was associated with spending fewer minutes in food preparation, this relationship varied by origin group. Acculturation did not appear to modify the relationship between hours worked and time spent in food preparation or family dinner. Mothers who worked late hours spent less time eating the evening meal with their families (−9.8 ± SE 1.3). Although an eight-hour workday was associated with a significant reduction in food preparation time, an unexpected result is that, for working mothers, additional time spent in paid work is not associated with the duration of family dinner later that day.

Studies of immigrant populations have shown that risk factors for CVD, including diet and physical activity, differ by acculturation. This cross-sectional study evaluated whether two measures of acculturation (region of birthplace, length of residence in the U.S.) were associated with CVD risk factors, dietary intakes, and physical activity of 125 older Chinese Americans who participated in health fairs conducted in NYC. In this study, mean waist circumference differed significantly by birthplace. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure differed significantly by length of residence in the U.S. Mean intake of vitamin B6, folate and calcium differed significantly by birthplace: Chinese Americans from Hong Kong had the highest mean vitamin B6 intake whereas older Chinese Americans from Northern China had the highest folate and calcium intakes. Mean intake of riboflavin differed significantly by length of residence in the U.S. with Chinese Americans adults who lived in the U.S. less than 10 years having the highest mean intake. Mean dairy intake of Chinese Americans differed significantly by birthplace, with adults from northern China having the highest mean dairy intake. Vigorous-intensity physical activity differed significantly by birthplace, with adults from Hong Kong reporting the most daily minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity. This study suggests that acculturation may be associated with the cardiovascular health of older Chinese Americans living in NYC.

Acculturation has also been linked with stress-related psychological disorder and depression. Aims: This article investigates the acculturation process and the depressive state of foreign immigrants living in the greater Athens area. Methods: All consecutive cases of 157 foreign immigrants who visited a nongovernmental organization (NGO) providing consultative services to immigrants were interviewed using a structured questionnaire including the Immigrant Acculturation Scale (IAS) and the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies--Depression (CES-D) scale. Results: Factor analysis of IAS yielded a three-factor solution and 17 items with loadings ranging from 0.74 to 0.41. This scale was also tested and proven to be reliable. The main finding is that the higher the acculturation level of the immigrant individual, the lower the CES-D scale score; the fewer the depressive symptoms are self-reported. Length of stay, existence of family in Greece, legal status of residence and employment were also found to have an effect on depressive symptomatology. Conclusion: Acculturation could be seen as a beneficial mechanism protecting the individual to be exposed to stressful non-adaptive behaviour.

Given the particular demands of agricultural labor, however, farmworkers and their partners are highly susceptible to a host of occupation-specific stressors that may result in relationship conflict, and thereafter IPV. In cases where one or both members of the dyad engage in problematic drinking, the likelihood of violence increases exponentially. The purpose of this exploratory quantitative study was to estimate the prevalence of IPV among a mixed gender sample of farmworkers in San Diego County, California, and assess the association of potential correlates (acculturation- and work-related stress, problem drinking, and impulsivity) to IPV. Bilingual interviewers conducted survey data collection by using standardized instruments (e.g., Revised Conflict Tactics Scale; Migrant Farm Work Stress Inventory; AUDIT). Nearly all participants (n = 100) were Mexican born. Results showed that approximately 16% of female individuals (n = 61) and 32% of male individuals (n = 37) reported partner violence perpetration, victimization, or both, in the past year. Significant correlates of IPV were problem drinking (among males) and impulsivity (among females). This study demonstrates the feasibility of conducting IPV research among male and female farmworkers. Additional research is warranted to more fully explore the role of acculturation- and work-related stress, drinking, and other personal characteristics and environmental factors in precipitating couple conflict and thereafter IPV.

Method: Participants were 128 older (50–80 years) Somali refugees living in Finland. They reported experiences of war trauma and childhood adversities, and filled-in questionnaires of perceived ethnic discrimination, religiousness (beliefs, attendance, and observance of Islamic faith), and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depressive (BDI-21), psychological distress (GHQ-12), and somatization (SCL-90). Results: Symptom-specific regression models showed that newly arrived refugees with non-permanent legal status and severe exposures to war trauma, childhood adversity, and discrimination endorsed greater PTSD symptoms, while only war trauma and discrimination were associated with depressive symptoms.

On the one hand, immigrants are provided with more opportunities not available in their home countries. On the other hand, they are far away from home and may have been exposed to traumatic experiences on their journeys to the receiving country. Even after settling down in the receiving country, most continue to face legal battles associated with their immigration status, as shown in this study. This study examined the risk and protective factors associated with the mental health conditions in a sample of 39 immigrants and refugees seeking legal services on the US-Mexico border. Participants were recruited from a southwestern community agency serving the region’s immigrant population over the past three decades. Negative mental health states including stress, sadness, and anxiety were frequently reported by the participants.

"929","Search2021","thesis",2010,"Lv, Hua","Mental health status of Asian and Latino/Caribbean immigrants.",0,"not acculturation","This study examines how the migration experience affects the mental health status of recent Asian and Latin American/Caribbean immigrants. It analyzes the relationship between stress among immigrants and their adaptation patterns. Specifically, this study focuses on the psycho-social transition processes associated with migration, examining how disruption of cultural norms, and restructured lifestyle may lead to stress, or other mental health difficulties. In addition, this study highlights 'transnationalism,' a newly defined adaptation pattern of recent immigrants, especially among Latin immigrants. It focuses on 'transnational activity' as a potential mediator of the relationship between immigration stressors and mental health outcomes among recent migrants from Asia and Latin America/Caribbean countries. Previous research has been largely dedicated to two aspects of immigrants' mental health status, post-traumatic stress disorder and acculturative related stress. This study includes both aspects, focusing on both the context of exit and the context of reception to analyze the factors associated with immigrants' mental health problems. Based on previous research, this study incorporates various theories and concepts, including stress theory, acculturation theory, the life course perspective and transnationalism to establish a synthetic model to explain mental health problems. Using the first wave data from New Immigrant Survey, this study includes a broad range of variables, employs logistic regression to examine the effects of pre-migration experiences and post-migration trajectories on symptoms of depression and distress among Asian and Latin American/Caribbean immigrants. Statistical results show that in general Asian immigrants have slightly better mental health than Latino/Caribbean immigrants. Socioeconomic status, gender, pre-migration persecution, social support, acculturation, transnationalism, and sub-ethnicity all predict symptoms of depression among immigrants with the exception of the age at arrival in the U.S. The effects of factors examined in this study vary slightly across ethnic groups. Future research should use longitudinal data in order to track the long-term effects and the patterns of immigrants' incorporation and their mental health status. In addition, the development of more synthetic theories and key concepts are suggested to better understand how the post migration trajectories of each sub-ethnic group within Asian and Latino/Caribbean immigrants' populations are related with their mental health status.

As they settle into the large urban cities, these internal migrants experience challenges that are similar to those of international migrants, and of members of ethnic groups who engage in the process of acculturation. Many see this flow as a problem, one that needs to be understood through research using evidence based on concepts and methods used in international acculturation research. In the present study, we examine the Urban Identity of 787 migrants, using the Migrant Workers’ Urban Identity Questionnaire developed by Gui (2010). This instrument distinguishes two aspects of urban identity: social identity and place identity. In addition, 328 of these respondents were tested with the Satisfaction with Life Scale (Diener, Emmons, Larson, & Griffin, 1985) and the Global Self-Worth Scale (Huang & Yang, 1998). Findings show that the acculturation strategies model based on international immigrants’ identity can apply to the seasonal migrant workers’ identity. With respect to their acculturation strategies: (1) different operationalisations of the second dimension in the two dimension model lead to a different classification of acculturation strategies; the ‘deeper’ the psychological phenomena the less migrant workers want to engage the national society; (2) different acculturation strategies were favored in social identity and place identity domains; (3) data from the Satisfaction with Life Scale and the Global Self-Worth Scale shows, by and large, that integration is the best acculturation strategy (and the marginalization the worst) for achieving wellbeing in both social identity and in place identity. This corresponds to findings and conclusions of much of the previous research on acculturation based on international migration.

Design/methodology/approach: The research employed a survey questionnaire applied to a sample of 210 migrants who had migrated from Sri Lanka to New Zealand. Twenty-three independent and three dependent (career success—objective and subjective) variables were measured. Sequential multiple regression analysis was applied, mirroring the time-sequenced theory of career development. Findings: Overall, migrants’ occupational status had declined markedly following migration. Variables representing human capital, social integration and career self-management perspectives all contributed substantially to explaining variances in career success, especially objective career success, but motivation to migrate did not. Human capital variables were especially influential in determining pre-migration success, acculturation in the host country and education in the host country in post-migration success. Effects of career self-management behaviors on success were relatively small. Research limitations/implications: A limitation is the cross-sectional design, and possible non-generalisability beyond a single migrant group and host country. Practical implications: The paper discusses implications for migrants, policy makers and future research. Originality/value: Migration, and interest in research on migrants’ careers, is growing. This paper applies a wide range of predictor variables and a logical causal model to predicting migrant career success, indicates significant effects, and points to positive actions that may be taken by government, organizations and migrants.

However, mental health outcomes stand in stark contrast to this epidemiological 'paradox,' as factors such as depression are significantly higher for Latino immigrants than other groups. Objective: We explore the link between migration and depressive feelings using a binational random survey of Mexicans in Durham, NC and sending communities in Mexico. Method: Explanations for the link between migration and depression, such as acculturative stress, lack of social support, and powerlessness and isolation, are analyzed by comparing results for protective vs. risk factors between residents of Mexico and Durham, and among immigrants themselves. Besides, selection hypothesis is explored using propensity matching scores. Results: Results show little support for selection as an important source of migrant depression, and instead provide strong evidence that migration itself, and the disruption of social networks that it entails, is primarily responsible for the association. Family separation, in particular, is the strongest predictor of depressive feelings and accounts for a sizeable portion of the heightened depression among migrants. Conclusions: Understanding the subjective experiences of migration is necessary to better integrate newcomers into host societies.

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether well-known acculturation surrogates were associated with obesity among Peruvian rural-to-urban migrants. We performed a cross-sectional survey, the PERU MIGRANT study, using single-stage random sampling. Evaluation included weight, height, and waist circumference (WC) as well as acculturation surrogates. Obesity was assessed using BMI and WC. Length of residence, age at migration, language proficiency, and language preferences (Spanish or Quechua) were assessed in logistic regression models to calculate odd ratios and 95% confidence intervals adjusting for potential confounders. A total of 589 rural-to-urban migrants were enrolled. The mean age was 47.8 (s.d.: 11.7, range: 30–92), and 280 (47.5%) were men. Obesity prevalence assessed using BMI was 30.4% among women and 10.7% among men (P < 0.001), whereas abdominal obesity assessed using WC was 29.1% among women and 19.1% among men (P < 0.01). Obesity was associated with older age at first migration, language speaking proficiency, and language preferences. The association between obesity and acculturation surrogates is variable in this population. Thus, acculturation per se can explore positive channels associated with better health outcomes. The patterns shown in this report suggest a more complex association for these factors.

Given that proficiency in the local language is a crucial social marker of immigrants’ integration, we argue that language mindsets (i.e., beliefs about whether language learning ability is fixed or changeable) guide members of the receiving society to make inferences about immigrants’ language ability (e.g., 'can immigrants improve their language ability?'). This social inference, in turn, predicts their willingness to interact with immigrants and support immigrants’ language education. In a correlational study (n = 231) and an experimental study (n = 106), we investigated whether and how language mindsets influence participants’ support for immigrants’ intercultural contact. We found that trait and experimentally-induced fixed (vs. growth) mindsets led to negative judgments of immigrants’ potential to develop their skills in the local language, which in turn predicted avoidance of contact with migrants and opposition to governmental funding of immigrants’ language education. The effects held even after controlling for participants’ political orientations, perceived difficulties of the English language, and judgments of target immigrants’ language fluency. These findings suggest that promoting growth mindsets about language ability can lead to more positive intercultural attitudes that impact the acceptance of migrants. We discussed the implications of language mindsets for understanding the processes of intercultural communication and forming positive intercultural relations.

While there has been some research on risk and uncertainty in migration, this has mostly been approached as a form of ‘rational’ decision-making: such approaches explain why some groups of individuals are more likely than others to migrate, but are limited in explaining individual variations in behaviour within these groups. Individual migrants vs. non-migrants are self-selected in terms of tolerance of risk and uncertainty but, with very few exceptions, there has been no research on migration within the framework of risk tolerance/aversion and competence to manage risk. Moreover, existing research is based on, and constrained by the limitations of, incumbent data-sets. Drawing on a specially commissioned large-scale survey of the UK population, this paper uses principal component analysis and logistic regression to analyse the extent to which risk and risk-related measures can be used to predict four different types of mobility profiles. There are significant associations between these individual mobility characteristics and general risk/uncertainty tolerance, and competence-based tolerance. These are strongest in terms of the two most polarised mobility types: the least mobile, the Stayers, and the most mobile, the Roamers. Recognising that previous migration is exogenous, a further analysis of migration intentions, with previous migration included as an independent variable, finds the propensity for future migration is, in fact, negatively associated with previous migration, probably due to the importance of ‘pure risk’ as opposed to acquired competence via migration experience, and to life cycle considerations.

Recently cross-cultural researchers have tended to focus on certain psychological and social moderators of stress that differentiate between migrants perceiving higher stress and those remaining relatively unscathed. The present study examined the moderating impact of coping resources (sense of coherence and perceived social support) and coping strategies (problem-focused and emotion-focused) on the relationship between acculturative stress and psychological wellbeing (positive functioning and negative health outcomes) in stress-coping model. On a final sample of 308 Pakistani immigrants residing in Greater Toronto Area a series of moderated hierarchical regression analyses were performed separately for positive and negative health outcomes. Results indicated that sense of coherence and perceived social support moderated between acculturative stress and positive functioning (self-acceptance, positive relations with others, autonomy, environmental mastery, purpose in life, personal growth), and acculturative stress and negative health outcomes (depression, psychosomatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia, social dysfunction).The current findings have implications for clinicians, researchers, and policy makers for the identification of resource factors that help to understand the resistant power of growing immigrant population to maintain positive functioning.

A further aim was to examine differences in MHW with level of education and acculturation in this immigrant group. Methods: The Pakistani women (N = 101) completed a questionnaire to assess MHW and sociodemographic variables. MHW data were obtained via telephone interviews for the subsample of Norwegian women (N = 344). Results: The Pakistani women generally showed lower levels of MHW than did the ethnic Norwegian women. However, when stratified on education, the difference was mainly apparent in the low and middle educational groups. The Pakistani women with high levels of education tended to report higher levels of MHW than those with lower education levels. They reported significantly higher levels of worries about avian flu, radiation from computer screens, and vaccination programmes than did the ethnic Norwegian women on the same high educational level.

Conclusions: The group of Pakistani immigrant women was very heterogeneous in terms of MHW, and health authorities and health care workers should therefor adapt health and risk information according to different levels of integration and education.

Methods: We analyzed the National Health Interview Survey-National Death Index linked files from 1997–2009 with mortality follow-up through 2011. We used Cox proportional hazard models to examine the effects of duration of US residence and age at immigration on mortality for US-born and foreign-born Hispanics, controlling for various demographic, socioeconomic and health factors. Age at immigration included 4 age groups: <18, 18–24, 25–34, and 35+ years. Duration of residence was 0–15 and >15 years. Results: We observed a mortality advantage among Hispanic immigrants compared to US-born Hispanics only for those who had come to the US after age 24 regardless of how long they had lived in the US. Hispanics who immigrated as youths (<18) did not differ from US-born Hispanics on mortality despite duration of residence.Conclusions: Findings suggest that age at immigration, rather than duration of residence, drives differences in mortality between Hispanic immigrants and the US-born Hispanic population.

First, extending a previous typology of immigrant mother–child relations in the Netherlands, Latent Class Analysis was conducted for transnational relations. As expected, combining information about given and/or received emotional and financial support resulted in an emotional-interdependent and detached transnational mother–child relationship. Second, acculturation effects were estimated by using relationship assignment as a dependent variable, performing Logistic Regressions on our uni-national and transnational sample. Findings were mixed, suggesting acculturation impacts differently on family relations within and across borders.

Scientific progress in the study of immigrant integration has been hampered by the lack of a common measure of integration, which would allow for the accumulation of knowledge through comparison across studies, countries, and time. To address this fundamental problem, we propose the Immigration Policy Lab (IPL) Integration Index as a pragmatic and multidimensional measure of immigrant integration. The measure, both in the 12-item short form (IPL-12) and the 24-item long form (IPL-24), captures six dimensions of integration: psychological, economic, political, social, linguistic, and navigational. The measure can be used across countries, over time, and across different immigrant groups and can be administered through short questionnaires available in different modes. We report on four surveys we conducted to evaluate the empirical performance of our measure. The tests reveal that the measure distinguishes among immigrant groups with different expected levels of integration and also correlates with well-established predictors of integration.

A cross-sectional research design with stratified-cluster proportional sampling technique was used. A multi-lingual questionnaire was developed, back-translated, and pilot-tested for reliability and validity. Study sample was 1174 Chinese, Koreans, Vietnamese, Cambodians, and other Asians. Findings revealed mean age of initiation to be 18.3, 40% ever and 30% current users. Significant differences were reflected in smoking by gender, ethnicity, educational level, and marital and employment status. Males were more likely to be smokers. While knowledge and attitudes about smoking and secondhand smoke were associated with these variables, ethnic pride and smoking status played significant roles. Results indicated that while fathers and brothers had greater social influence on young male smoking behavior, smoking friends had influence on both genders. Additionally, both stages of change of smoking and acculturation impact on smoking varied with gender, age, and time living in U.S. Findings provide comprehensive insights into tobacco use among Asian Americans that reflect the need for developing culturally appropriate programs for this population.

Inspired by the work of Berry (1980) on acculturation strategies (i.e. integration, assimilation, separation and marginalization), we distinguish migrants who feel a relatively strong or weak sense of belonging to larger society and those who feel a strong or weak belonging to the 'own group.' We expect that more national belonging contributes to less loneliness. We add a transnational perspective by arguing that feelings of belonging to the own group can take place in the country of settlement, but can also be transnational, i.e. a feeling of belonging to the country of origin. Transnational belonging can protect against loneliness, as it acknowledges the importance of place attachment. Using data from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam on older migrants aged 55–66, we employ latent class analysis and find five national belonging clusters, interpretable in terms of Berry’s acculturation strategies. Further analyses reveal mixed evidence: some aspects of transnational belonging vary with belonging to the own group, but other aspects point to a third dimension of belonging. Regression analysis shows that those marginalized are loneliest and that a transnational sense of belonging contributes to more loneliness. We conclude that Berry’s (1980) typology is useful for interpreting older migrants’ national belonging and that a transnational sense of belonging is apparent among older migrants, but needs to be explored further.

One hundred thirty-five French undergraduates completed a questionnaire measuring these factors. Path analysis showed that higher national identification increased perception of immigrants as a threat, which in turn predicted increased endorsement of assimilation for immigrants. The link between endorsement of assimilation and prejudice was not significant. In contrast, lower national identification decreased perception of immigrants as a threat and, in turn, increased endorsement of multiculturalism and reduced levels of prejudice. An alternative model specifying perception of threat as an outcome of preferences for multiculturalism or assimilation did not fit the data well. Results suggest that perceived threat from immigration is the key factor that guides the preferences of the majority group for acculturation ideologies and, through these preferences, shapes intergroup attitudes.

Women self-reported the number of years they had lived in the US (mean 17.6) as well as their preferred language across several domains, which was used to calculate a language acculturation score. Nearly all the women (98%) were born outside the US with the majority (65%) born in Mexico and the majority of women (69%) had low language acculturation, i.e., answered 'only Spanish' in every domain.

It is motivated by the conundrum between these migrants' high pre-migration human capital and their lower-than-expected post-migration socioeconomic status in the U.S. Angled at the intersection of race and migration, this research is informed by four major bodies of theory—international migration theory, theories on racial hierarchy and race relations, contemporary assimilation theory, and social network theory. This research has a two-fold agenda: (1) to uncover how race/ethnicity and social class accommodate or obstruct the migration and assimilation of African immigrants and (2) to clarify how social networks in various contexts facilitate or constrain the assimilation of African-horn migrants in the U.S. This research employs an extended case method approach which is suitable for research that aims to reconstruct existing theory. The instruments include a survey on background information, in-depth interviews on migration history and adaptation process, survey instruments for network analysis, and 'shadowing' observations with Ghanaian and Nigerian immigrants residing in Maryland. A snowball sampling technique was used to recruit participants that vary by individual and contextual characteristics through school, work, and neighborhood-based associations, voluntary organizations, and field contacts. I find that Ghanaians and Nigerians migrate to the United States in pursuit of educational and occupational opportunity in a politically stable society. They use their human-cultural, social, and financial capital to acquire a vast array of visas in pursuit of the American Dream. However, their ability to successfully integrate into American society is circumscribed by their immigration status, race, gender, and class backgrounds as illustrated by their migration processes, educational experiences, workforce trajectories, and social integration patterns in the United States. While I st generation immigrants exhibit varying degrees of success, their determination and selective acculturation strategies—mainstream economic integration coupled with selective cultural assimilation—pave the way for subsequent cohorts and generations of Ghanaian and Nigerian immigrants to enjoy upward mobility in American society. These findings establish assimilation as a multigenerational process circumscribed by societal structure but also negotiated through immigrant agency.

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between panic attacks, minority status, and nativity by focusing on the effects of health lifestyle behaviors and discrimination. Methods: Multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression, which was used to estimate the probability of meeting the criteria for panic attacks (n = 17,249). Results: Demographic and socioeconomic variables had significant associations; females had over 2.4 times higher odds than males of meeting the criteria for panic attacks. The more frequently respondents were treated as dishonest, less smart, with disrespect, threatened, or called names, the more likely they met the criteria for panic attacks. Additionally, smoking and alcohol abuse were significant predictors of panic attacks. Those who abused alcohol have over 2 times the odds of having panic attacks. Similarly, smokers had 52% higher odds of panic attacks than non-smokers. Limitations: The primary limitation of this project was the lack of a true acculturation measure with a secondary limitation being the inability to determine respondents' legal status. Conclusions: Key findings were that health lifestyle choices and exposure to discrimination significantly affected the chance of having panic attacks. Nativity was protective; however, its effect was ameliorated by exposure to discrimination or engagement in smoking behavior or alcohol abuse. Thus, this study offers insight into contextual factors for clinicians caring for racial and ethnic minorities diagnosed with panic attacks.

An instrument measuring both dimensions of success was developed. The study was based on data from the 2011 Immigrant Survey completed by a representative sample of the immigrant population in Israel, including 2927 immigrants from the Former Soviet Union, Asia & Africa, Europe & America, and Ethiopia. Structural Equation Modeling were used to generate the model of immigrants' success. The main paths of success were outlined. The path of the low-skilled visible minority contrasted with the path of other, more highly skilled groups of immigrants who resembled the local majority population to a greater degree.

The hypothesis was supported that a larger perceived cultural distance between mainstream and immigrant culture is associated with less psychological (homesickness and stress) and sociocultural (behavior with Russian students and behavior with co-nationals) adjustment. The statistical relations between perceived cultural distance, personality and sociocultural adjustment were much stronger for host domain behavior than for home domain behavior. Adjustment was higher for participants with more cultural empathy, openmindedness and flexibility. Adjustment showed statistically stronger associations with cultural distance than with acculturation orientations.

This study assessed the relation of perceived discrimination with depressive symptoms and drug use. Covariates included immigrant generation status (GS). A second objective was to examine the potentially moderating effect of neighborhoods' ethnic composition as suggested by Mair et al. Design: Secondary data analyses of a longitudinal survey examined self-reports of Hispanic adolescents in 9th grade (the first year of high school) and 11th grade at seven high schools in Los Angeles. Results: (1) Perceiving discrimination in 9th grade significantly predicted depressive symptoms (β = 0.23, p < 0.01) and drug use (β = 0.12, p < 0.01) in 11th grade, even after controlling for socioeconomic status, gender, acculturation, and GS in the USA. The third GS group reported significantly higher perceptions of discrimination compared to newer immigrants. (2) Neighborhoods' ethnic composition was included as a moderator of the association between perceived discrimination and the outcomes, but did not moderate the relation. Conclusion: Teaching Hispanic adolescents effective strategies for coping with discrimination, such as increasing their sense of belongingness in the American mainstream, may prove useful in preventing drug use and depressive symptoms.

In addition, studies have shown that acculturation may increase levels of perceived discrimination among foreign-born Mexicans living in the U.S. The primary purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between perceived racism and ambulatory blood pressure among a convenience sample of 332 foreign-born Mexicans living in Utah County, Utah controlling for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and acculturation. This was done through the use of several multiple regression analyses using archival data collected at Brigham Young University. The Perceived Ethnic Discrimination Questionnaire—Community Version (Brief PEDQ—CV) was used to measure perceived racism. The Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans (ARSMA-II) was used to measure both language and general acculturation. Four blood pressure variables, including waking systolic blood pressure (WSBP), waking diastolic blood pressure (WDBP), sleeping systolic blood pressure (SSBP), and sleeping diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) were used as outcome variables in the regression analyses. A relationship between perceived racism and any of the ambulatory blood pressure variables used in this study was not found. In addition, English-language acculturation was not found to moderate the relationship between perceived racism and blood pressure in the sample of first generation Mexicans participating in this study. A moderating effect of general acculturation on the relationship between perceived racism and blood pressure was found when controlling for age, BMI, and gender, though this moderating effect disappeared when WDBP was included in the regression model.

Our research questions are: (1) Which factors are associated with ties between immigrants and ‘Spaniards’ (the more settled resident Spanish population), compared with immigrants and non-Spaniards (other immigrants)? (2) Do the support roles of Spaniards and non-Spaniards differ? We analyse personal network (ego-net) survey data. Multilevel logistic regression models are applied, in which the unit of analysis is the undirected tie between an immigrant (ego) and an alter and the dependent variable is whether this tie is to a Spaniard alter, as opposed to a non-Spaniard. We determine the characteristics that are most strongly associated with the probability of a tie between an immigrant and a Spaniard, compared with a non-Spaniard, and consider characteristics of the immigrants (ego), the alters, the relative characteristics of ego-alter, support roles, and local geographical factors. We find a tie to a Spaniard alter is more likely if the immigrant’s country of birth is Portugal or Eastern Europe; if the alter is a work colleague or neighbour; if alter is older than ego. There is geographical variation in the probability of ties to Spaniards, partly explained by the local area presence of co-nationals from the same country of origin as the immigrant. A tie to a Spaniard alter is less likely for immigrants from North Africa (Maghreb); those with no previous contact with Spain; those who are not the first of their peer group/family to immigrate; if ego and alter both work in agriculture. Material help is more likely to be exchanged with a Spaniard alter. Non-Spaniard alters are more likely to exchange help with accommodation and information. ‘Finding a job’ is equally associated with Spaniard and non-Spaniard alters. A tentative conclusion is that some combinations of these characteristics, where a tie to a Spaniard is less likely, may be associated with higher levels of prejudice. Conversely, those characteristics that are positively associated with a tie to a Spaniard may indicate situations where integration of the immigrant population with Spaniards is successfully taking place, and where prejudices are lower, or non-existent. These findings may therefore be helpful for targeting resources to reduce such prejudices. The different types of support exchanged between immigrants and Spaniards and immigrants and non-Spaniards, may indicate current shortfalls in this process, as well as indicating where this support is successfully being exchanged.

The main aim was to understand whether nationals’ personal values predict their acculturation preferences towards immigrants, both directly and through national identity. Four hundred and forty-six Italian high school students (Mage = 19.1; SD = 0.57; females = 54.4%) completed a self-administered questionnaire assessing personal values, nationalism, patriotism, acculturation preferences and demographics. An SEM model with bootstrapping estimations was tested. As expected, the results highlighted that personal values predict acculturation preferences towards immigrants in two ways—directly and also through an indirect effect on nationalism—supporting the claim that ingroup and outgroup definitions are closely intertwined. The results also highlighted the need to differentiate between nationalism and patriotism, with the latter having no influence on Italian nationals’ readiness to accept immigrants. Overall, the research demonstrates the relevance of personal values in studying intergroup relations and draws attention to the potential value of communication policies centred on self-transcendence values to improve interethnic relations.

"972","Search2021","thesis",2014,"Siddiqui, Aisha","Physical activity in a culturally and linguistically diverse population of South Asian women.",0,"not migrant","Obesity is one of the fastest growing epidemics in the US and it is alarming because it is linked to many serious diseases including diabetes and heart disease. South Asians have a disproportionately higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Evidence suggests a strong association between physical inactivity and the absolute risk of heart disease and diabetes. After controlling for age and socioeconomic status, female immigrants were found to be less likely to engage in any leisure time physical activities and more likely to have a high BMI. There is a serious concern that South Asians engage in less leisure time physical activity. Very little is known about South Asian women's appreciation of physical activity and how it is related to their acculturation. The purpose of this study was to collect exploratory data on the levels of physical activity and acculturation among South Asian women. A cross-sectional mixed methods study was conducted using qualitative focus groups and quantitative survey for methodological triangulation. The study sampled South Asian women of Bangladeshi, Indian, or Pakistani descent, at least 18 years old, living in the Houston metropolitan area. The results from both the qualitative and the quantitative data suggested that physical activity was low among South Asian women. The qualitative data showed that the sampled population generally had no or inconsequential issues with the sociocultural adaptations and they learned the benefits of physical activity while living in the United States but their psychological adaptation was hampered mainly by their religious and cultural beliefs. The main reasons for insufficient physical activity were lack of time or energy and modest dressing requirements. More than half of the study participants were interested in physical activity programs specifically designed for South Asian women and most of them used social media but they were not interested in an online physical activity program. The conclusion of this study was that language is not a major limiting factor in the acculturation of South Asian women and is not a good measure of their acculturation. A blatant difference in their lifestyles is deep rooted in religious and cultural beliefs and more research in this area will help greatly.

This study introduces another approach that holds that place, as opposed to the timing of socialization, is an important consideration for the socialization of racial attitudes. Using data from the American National Election Study, we consider the effect of region and urban residency on racial attitudes by comparing lifelong residents of these locations to those who migrate into and out of them. Using improved measures of early life socialization and region of residency, we conclude that a place-based model can be used to explain the socialization of racial resentment. For regional migrants, those moving into and out of the non-South maintain levels of racial resentment similar to non-Southern stayers. For urban migrants, the lifelong openness model of socialization was most appropriate. These migrants were more likely to change and adopt the level of racial resentment similar to that of their destination peers. These findings generally persist across time.

This paper engages with the anxiety, discontent, and resentment experienced by a sub-set of residents in a multi-ethnic neighbourhood in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. I show how these emotions are grounded in everyday interactions with ‘Others’ but also stem from residents' placed subjectivities: perceptions of the self in relation to symbolic and material geographies of the city and the nation. Placed subjectivities in turn informed how residents were (not) able to deal with difference. While some residents demonstrated a by now familiar rhetoric of discontent, others developed new ways of interacting with place and defining their own position, despite their discomfort. These ‘productive discontents’ might allow for small-scale and ambivalent forms of neighbouring across difference.

To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study of predictors of acculturative hassles in a refugee population.

Higher psychological distress, lower quality of life, lower self-reported state of health, and less education at T3 were associated with higher levels of hassles at T3. More psychological distress at T2 and less education at arrival (T1) were significant predictors for more acculturative hassles at T3.

The present study examined the sociocultural adjustment of sojourning Malaysian students in Britain. Eighty-one Malay and 110 Chinese students enrolled in various courses answered a self-report questionnaire that examined various aspects of sociocultural adjustment. A series of one-way analyses of variance showed that Malay participants experienced poorer sociocultural adjustment in comparison with their Chinese counterparts. They were also less likely than Chinese students to have contact with co-nationals and host nationals, more likely to perceive their actual experience in Britain as worse than they had expected, and more likely to perceive greater cultural distance and greater discrimination. The results of regression analyses showed that, for Malay participants, perceived discrimination accounted for the greatest proportion of variance in sociocultural adjustment (73%), followed by English language proficiency (10%) and contact with host nationals (4%). For Chinese participants, English language proficiency was the strongest predictor of sociocultural adjustment (54%), followed by expectations of life in Britain (18%) and contact with host nationals (3%). By contrast, participants' sex, age, and length of residence failed to emerge as significant predictors for either ethnic group. Possible explanations for this pattern of findings are discussed, including the effects of Islamophobia on Malay-Muslims in Britain, possible socioeconomic differences between Malay and Chinese students, and personality differences between the two ethnic groups. The results are further discussed in relation to practical steps that can be taken to improve the sociocultural adjustment of sojourning students in Britain.

Factors studied included perceived acculturation expectations of the members of the receiving society, values, cultural identities, general well-being, self-efficacy, cultural knowledge, social networks in the new home country, language proficiency, perceived cultural similarity, support for multicultural ideology and perceived discrimination in the country of origin. In line with the hypotheses, the respondents preferred integration over assimilation, separation and marginalisation strategies. Discriminant analysis was computed to distinguish integrationists, assimilationists and separationists, resulting in two functions that discriminated between the groups. The most important predictors explaining pre-migration acculturation attitudes were the perceptions potential migrants have of future hosts’ preferences for immigrants’ cultural maintenance and contacts with hosts. In addition, general well-being, Russian identity and support for multicultural ideology significantly predicted acculturation attitudes in the pre-migration stage. The study highlights the importance of acknowledging that acculturation begins already at the pre-migration stage. It contributes to our understanding of pre-acculturation in general and factors affecting the formation of pre-migration acculturation attitudes in particular.

We examined the association between pre-migration and post-migration potentially traumatic events and stressors and mental health, and assessed the moderating effect of post-migration stressors in humanitarian migrants in Australia. Methods: In this study, we used the first wave of data between 2013 and 2014 from the Building a New Life in Australia survey. The survey included 2399 migrants who had arrived in Australia holding a permanent humanitarian visa 3–6 months preceding the survey, with 77% and 23% of participants being granted visas through offshore and onshore humanitarian programmes, respectively. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was measured with the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder 8 items (PTSD-8) and severe mental illness was measured with the Kessler Screening Scale for Psychological Distress (K6). Pre-migration potentially traumatic events and post-migration stressors related to asylum process and resettlement were measured with a self-reported questionnaire. Findings: Of the 2399 participants, 762 (31%; 95% CI 29·4–33·2) had PTSD and 394 (16%; 95% CI 14·2–17·2) had severe mental illness. The mean number of pre-migration potentially traumatic events was 2·1 (SD 1·4). 64%, 59%, 49%, and 18% of participants reported poor social integration, economic problems, worrying about family or friends overseas, and loneliness as post-migration stressors. Pre-migration potentially traumatic events and post-migration stressors were positively associated with PTSD and severe mental illness. Factors significantly modifying the association between pre-migration potentially traumatic events and mental health after controlling for confounding factors were resettlement related stressors, including loneliness (odds ratio 1·17, 95% CI 1·05–1·28 for PTSD and 1·28, 1·16–1·41 for severe mental illness) and the number of social integration stressors (1·10, 1·05–1·16 for PTSD). Interpretation: Our data suggest that post-migration resettlement-related stressors were the most important correlates of mental health in humanitarian migrants, accounting for both direct and indirect associations. Targeting resettlement-related stressors through augmenting psychosocial care programmes and social integration would be a key approach to improve humanitarian migrants' mental health.

While public attention has primarily centered on opioid misuse among White individuals, less attention has been devoted to opioid misuse among one of the United States' fastest-growing demographic groups: Hispanic immigrants and their descendants. This study therefore examined prescription opioid misuse among U.S. Hispanic adults, with attention to within-group differences and the role of acculturation-related characteristics. Methods: Data were derived from the 7037 U.S. Hispanic adults in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III (2012−2013). Weighted proportions, adjusted odds ratios, and 95% confidence intervals were computed for past-year and lifetime prescription opioid misuse. Binomial logistic regression models examined the association between acculturation-related characteristics and prescription opioid misuse. Results: Past-year prevalence of prescription opioid misuse among U.S. Hispanic adults was lower in the first generation (1.6%), compared with the second (4.1%), third (6.8%), and higher-than-third (6.2%) generations, and a similar pattern was observed for lifetime prevalence. Higher generation, greater English language orientation, and length of time living in the United States were significantly associated with higher odds of past-year and lifetime prescription opioid misuse. Conclusions: Relying solely on comparisons of prevalence between ethnic groups may obscure significant variations within ethnic groups. Second, third, and higher generation Hispanics are higher-risk subgroups, with rates of prescription opioid misuse approaching or surpassing the rates reported among non-Hispanic Whites.

The socio-historical and economic background of the host country may play an important role in the mental health status of migrants. As studies are mostly conducted in developed countries, researching migration in developing countries may add important information to scientific literature. Aims: This study aims to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression symptoms in Haitian migrants in southern Brazil. Methods: The sample comprises 66 participants selected from four different sites in three cities of a Brazilian southern state. Participants fulfilled a sociodemographic questionnaire, as well as instruments investigate traumatic events; post-migration difficulties and symptoms of PTSD, anxiety and depression. Linear regression models were utilized to investigate factors associated with PTSD, anxiety and depression symptoms. Results: PTSD prevalence in the sample was 9.1%. Depression and anxiety symptoms were in the clinical range of 10.6%–13.6% of participants, respectively. A number of traumatic events, acculturation difficulties, discrimination and low social support were associated with the investigated mental health disorders. Conclusion: The results point to the importance of public policies in promoting better social and mental health support for migrants.

These MSM comprise a subpopulation that tends to remain 'hidden' from both researchers and practitioners. This study was designed to estimate the prevalence of tobacco, alcohol, and drug use, and sexual risk behaviors of Latino MSM living in rural North Carolina. Methods: A community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership used respondent-driven sampling (RDS) to identify, recruit, and enroll Latino MSM to participate in an interviewer-administered behavioral assessment. RDS-weighted prevalence of risk behaviors was estimated using the RDS Analysis Tool. Data collection occurred in 2008. Results: A total of 190 Latino MSM was reached; the average age was 25.5 years and nearly 80% reported being from Mexico. Prevalence estimates of smoking everyday and past 30-day heavy episodic drinking were 6.5% and 35.0%, respectively. Prevalence estimates of past 12-month marijuana and cocaine use were 56.0% and 27.1%, respectively. Past 3-month prevalence estimates of sex with at least one woman, multiple male partners, and inconsistent condom use were 21.2%, 88.9%, and 54.1%, respectively. Conclusions: Respondents had low rates of tobacco use and club drug use, and high rates of sexual risk behaviors. Although this study represents an initial step in documenting the health risk behaviors of immigrant Latino MSM who are part of a new trend in Latino immigration to the southeastern United States, a need exists for further research, including longitudinal studies to understand the trajectory of risk behavior among immigrant Latino MSM.

Race and nativity may be associated with such decisions to 'self‐medicate' with alcohol. This study identified and compared links between problem drinking and social structural and mental health‐related factors for four race‐nativity groups. Methods: Using data from the 2009 National Health Interview Survey, the final sample comprised 7,905 US‐born Whites, 390 foreign‐born Whites, 2,110 US‐born Blacks, and 193 foreign‐born Blacks. Investigated were the social structural variables of demographic factors (age, gender), socioeconomic status (employment, income, education), and social integration factors (family size, living with a partner). Mental health‐related variables included chronic mental illness and access to and use of mental health services. Results: Overall, both types of variables were found to be associated with large‐quantity drinking and frequent binging, with the strength of association varying—for some factors—by race and/or nativity. Further, the findings indicated that, in the presence of chronic mental illness, both US‐ and foreign‐born Black Americans engaged in relatively frequent binge‐drinking when health‐care variables were controlled. Conclusions and Scientific Significance: These results underscore the need for mental health professionals to identify co‐occurring mental illness and alcohol abuse among Black clients and, where it is found, to seek the root causes of the persistent stress that tends to accompany this co‐occurrence.

The main objective of this study was to identify some of the most salient reserve capacity resources (i.e., psychosocial factors that can protect against and mitigate the effects of stressors) available to Latina MFWs. Secondarily, we aimed to examine the relationships between the presence of these resources and depression, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation. Participants underwent an intensive semistructured interview and completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS). Content analyses of interviews revealed 10 psychosocial reserve capacity resources: religion/God as a source of emotional support, satisfaction with social support, feeling supported by romantic partner, having somebody to confide in, having friends in the United States, showing hope toward the future, having an end goal (e.g., saving for a house in Mexico), feeling a sense of control over her life, showing pride in the fact that she is able to support her family through farm work, and showing endurance. The aggregate protective influence of the available psychosocial resources was negatively associated with depression (r = −.35), hopelessness (r = −.28), and suicidal ideation (r = −.29); however, none of these associations were statistically significant. Although stress is inherent to the MFW lifestyle, we found many protective psychosocial resources available to help mitigate stress. Latina MFWs can be highly resilient in the face of exposure to structural conditions that keep them in poverty and are detrimental to their mental health.

Moreover, the extent of depressed mood reported by newcomer and more experienced adolescent immigrants converged over time. This pattern of results indicates that both age-typical development and acculturation need to be considered when drawing conclusions on change in psychological adaptation over time in immigrant populations.

Mexican Americans compose two thirds of the nation's largest and fastest-growing minority group, Latinos. We report 12-month DSM-III- R psychiatric disorder rates among Mexican Americans derived from a population survey of immigrants and US-born adults of Mexican origin conducted in rural and urban areas of central California. Rates of 12-month total mood, anxiety, and substance disorders were 14.2% for immigrant women, 12.6% for immigrant men, 27.8% for US-born women, and 27.2% for US-born men. For immigrants, younger age of entry and longer residence in the United States were associated with increased rates of psychiatric disorders. Three dominant explanations are reviewed to explain these differences: selection, social assimilation and stress, and measurement artifact. Our results and other research studies collectively support a social assimilation explanation based on aversive impact on health behaviors and protective resources such as families. Greater social assimilation increases psychiatric morbidity, with rates for subjects who are US-born of Mexican origin approximately the same as rates for the US general population.

We addressed a bidimensional model of acculturation, considering both orientations toward home and host cultures, and assessed the relevance of Berry's four-cell typology of acculturation (integration, assimilation, separation, and marginalization). Based on the unique characteristics of the present sample, including that they were all born in Korea and had been exposed to their home culture for a substantial amount of time, we hypothesized that their orientation towards original culture would be strong and that simple application of Berry's four-cell typology would not be relevant. As expected, scores on Korean orientation were distributed toward the high end of the scale, suggesting a high level of familiarity and adherence to the original culture; scores on American orientation were correspondingly low. Cluster analysis showed that a two-cluster model was an optimal group classification in the sample used in this investigation. The groups were identified as 'integrated group' and 'separated group.' Compared to the separated group, integrated group was more likely to be younger, married, and educated. More years of residence in the U.S. and better physical and mental health were observed among those who were integrated. The findings call attention to the needs to consider the unique nature of immigrant samples in order to adequately apply the acculturation typologies.

According to Ward and colleagues, both psychological and sociocultural adaptation change at different rates and extend into later life. For this study, participants 50+ years of age and born in Iran completed questionnaires measuring life satisfaction, depressive symptoms, acculturation, and demographic and sociocultural variables (e.g., pre- and post-immigration occupational status). We collected study data anonymously in Persian to obtain responses from long-term residents of Canada as well as more recent immigrants who may not read or write English. We examined both life satisfaction and (the absence of) depressive symptoms as distinct forms of psychological adaptation; these emerged as independent predictors of acculturation. Contrary to theory, acculturation appears to predict life satisfaction, not vice versa; moreover, there seems to be no direct link between depressive symptoms and acculturation. Our findings suggest that integration within Canadian society is associated with higher life satisfaction. In contrast, sociocultural factors are indirectly associated with life satisfaction (except age) and acculturation (except ethnic diversity of social interactions). Involuntary migrants reported higher levels of depression, whereas loss of occupational status is associated with reduced life satisfaction. Implications for future research and health policy are discussed.

Two hundred and twenty-one Thai male workers were interviewed using a structured questionnaire that included demographic variables and occupational exposures to organophosphate pesticides, migration stressors, intervening variables, and a psychological distress scale. In multivariate analysis, migration stressors, the migrants' traditional health beliefs, quality of current social relationships, drinking behavior, as well as age and occupational exposure were significantly associated with psychological distress. A moderating effect of the quality of social relationships with coworkers on the association between homesickness and psychological distress was found. Additionally, migrants aged 28-34 and those who were experiencing eye irritation from chemicals at work had significantly increased levels of distress. The findings demonstrate the focal role of specific migration stressors and the current socio-cultural context on psychological distress of migrant workers.

The sample included a substantial proportion of ex-political detainees who experienced a particularly large number of traumatic events prior to migration. Additionally, the study assessed postmigration experiences using multidimensional and bidirectional measures of acculturation to the Vietnamese and American cultures and measures of satisfaction with social support from like-ethnic and host culture network members. Psychological adjustment and distress were assessed with depression, anxiety, alienation, and life satisfaction. Findings show that premigration traumatic experiences predicted only measures of anxiety. The other measures of adjustment and distress were predicted by postmigration factors, including acculturation and social support. In sum, findings suggest that different psychological outcomes are predicted by different pre- and postmigration factors, suggesting that adjustment is a complex process that involves multiple indicators and dimensions. Significant differences were also found between ex-political detainees and other Vietnamese refugees suggesting the importance of considering their unique experience.

Method: Personal interviews were held with 3906 veteran Israelis, 845 immigrants from the former Soviet Union (FSU) and 107 immigrants from other countries (all the immigrants immigrated after 1989). Psychological distress was measured on the General Health Questionnaire-12. Results: Psychological distress among FSU immigrants was significantly higher than among veteran Israelis and immigrants from elsewhere. FSU immigrants were almost twice as likely to report severe psychological distress. Factors associated with psychological distress were female gender, age above 50, being divorced/widowed, being secular, having higher education and being either unemployed or 'not in workforce'. Conclusion: The results support the acculturation stress hypothesis as an explanation for psychological distress in immigrants only in immigrants from the FSU, indicating that policymakers should plan services and prevention programmes differentially for different immigrant populations.

Results indicated that deportees, in various degrees, experienced the phenomenon of psychological homelessness and enculturative stress related to living in El Salvador.

Methods: The data were derived from the Population Study of Chinese Elderly in Chicago (N = 3,159). Negative binomial regressions were performed to predict depression and anxiety, respectively, by entering the three sets of coping resources separately and jointly, controlling for socio-demographic and acculturation variables. Results: Stronger sense of mastery and greater perception of children's filial piety were associated with better mental health outcomes. Spousal support was not associated with any mental health outcomes, and family support was actually associated with greater depression and anxiety. Stronger community cohesion was associated with fewer depressive symptoms but greater anxiety. Conclusion: Older immigrants’ sense of control and perception that children adhere to traditional family norms are important mental health protective factors. Whereas depending on families for support may compromise their well-being, community cohesion could be a double-edged sword for their mental health.

Latent class analysis specified separated, partial separated, bicultural and marginal profiles of acculturation among Latino immigrants. Notably, our findings identified a small, albeit significant, marginal class among Latino immigrants, and both bivariate and multivariate findings demonstrated that those in marginal class reported the poorest mental health.

Overall, this investigation further underscores the importance of family support as an element of immigrant acculturation experience and mental health. From a policy perspective, social support, specifically family support, is critical for immigrant mental health, and a lack of family support may increase the risk for developing a marginal experience and mental health problems among a growing population of Latino immigrants in the United States.

This study uses a life course perspective to examine how human agency (measured by voluntariness, migratory reasons, and planning) and timing (measured by age at immigration) affect mental health outcomes among Asian immigrants in the United States. Data from the National Latino and Asian American Study showed that Asian immigrants (n = 1491) with multiple strong reasons to migrate were less likely to suffer from mental health problems (i.e., psychological distress and psychiatric disorders in the past 12 months) than those without clear goals. Moreover, Asian immigrants with adequate migratory planning had lower levels of distress and lower rates of 12-month psychiatric disorders than those with poorly planned migration. Compared with migrants of the youngest age category (six or younger), those who migrated during preteen and adolescent years without clear goals had higher levels of psychological distress, and those who migrated during adulthood (25 years or older) were less likely to suffer from recent depressive disorders (with the exception of those migrating for life-improving goals).

Specifically, the study investigated the mediating effects of adjustment in occupational and social life domains on the relationship between acculturation and psychological adjustment for 391 refugees from the former Soviet Union. The study used bilinear measures of acculturation to the host (American) and heritage (Russian) cultures. Using Structural Equation Modeling, the study confirmed the hypothesized relationships, such that the positive effects of American acculturation on psychological adjustment were mediated by occupational adjustment, and the effects of Russian acculturation on psychological adjustment were mediated by satisfaction with co-ethnic social support. Psychological adjustment was measured in two ways, as psychological well-being, using a measure of life satisfaction, and as symptoms of depression and anxiety, using the Hopkins symptom checklist (HSCL). Life satisfaction served as a mediator between adjustment in occupational and social domains and HSCL, suggesting that it may be an intervening variable through which environmental stress associated with immigration contributes to the development of symptoms of mental disorder.

This cross-sectional study aims to evaluate the prevalence of psychotic symptoms among Romanian immigrants living in very poor conditions at an abandoned hotel in Bologna and to highlight the possible correlation with general health status, distress and sociodemographic characteristics. Methods: The Psychosis Screening Questionnaire (PSQ) and General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) were administered to all immigrants residing at the hotel during two index days with the help of a cultural mediator. Socio-demographic, migration and health characteristics were also collected. Results: Sixty eight subjects were evaluated. More than 80% had left Romania for economic reasons. Of immigrants, 57% exceeded the four-point GHQ-12 threshold of potential mental disorder and 19% scored positively at the PSQ. Immigrants with positive PSQ showed higher mean GHQ-12 scores (5.9 ± 3.5 vs. 3.8 ± 2.75; p = 0.02). The development of post-migration health problems significantly predicts positive PSQ cases even after adjusting for age, sex and GHQ-12 dichotomized score (OR = 21.2, CI = 1.1–169.4). Conclusion: This community of immigrants living in deprived conditions showed a high prevalence of distress and psychotic symptoms, related to health problems. Preventing excess of psychosis among immigrants and ethnic minorities in critical socio-economic conditions should mean, first and foremost, facilitating social integration and access to primary care.

Each of these studies concerns their sense of purpose, acculturation experiences, and identity development in relation to their educational and occupational achievements, as well as their psychological wellbeing over time. For the qualitative analysis, the participants were interviewed during two different phases of the study. The first set of in-depth individual interviews was conducted in 2007 (Phase 1) with 19 South Sudanese URMs who had resettled in the United States in 2001. From 2014--2015 (Phase 2), 11 of the 19 participants from Phase 1 were interviewed again. Using a modified grounded theory approach, these two sets of qualitative data were analyzed in terms of the participants' purpose development, multidimensional acculturation, identity reformation and integration, educational and occupational achievements, and overall life satisfaction. There are three theoretical frameworks that guide the current research project: a) Damon's purpose-development theory, b) Ferguson's tridimensional acculturation theory, and c) Portes and Zhou's segmented assimilation theory. Based on these three existing theories and their measurements, this study attempts to describe South Sudanese URMs' identified goals, life purposes, major achievements (especially in terms of education and occupation), changes and modifications to their goals, resettlement challenges, social barriers, and how these factors have influenced their long-term adjustment in the U.S. This study's findings reveal the prevalence of an other-oriented/beyond-the-self (BTS) purpose among the South Sudanese URMs that helped them to overcome resettlement challenges and promote positive adjustment and psychological wellbeing. The findings also describe how their process of purpose development was closely related to and influenced by their four-dimensional acculturation experiences, with identity reformation and integration providing insights into their educational and occupational achievements and general life satisfaction as the determinants of long-term adjustment. In the following complementary quantitative study, a questionnaire was developed using existing scales and measurements to evaluate the levels of general purpose and BTS purpose, variables of resettlement challenges such as emotional strain and perceived discrimination, and key adjustment outcomes such as educational and occupational attainment. As a result of multiple regression analyses, the moderation effect of prosocial purpose was found to be statistically significant in promoting better adjustment outcomes by buffering the negative impact of resettlement challenges.

When the data were disaggregated by state for the period from 2002 to 2006, each racial and ethnic group displayed varied ranges of representation. Those varied distributions can be attributed to each state’s unique demographic profile, varied definitions of giftedness, identification procedures, and identification policies.

Reading anxiety was significantly correlated with classroom anxiety and reader self-perception. Classroom anxiety scores were significantly correlated with motivation and reader self-perception. Significant positive correlations were found between language motivation and reader self-perception scores, and between years studying Arabic and reader self-perception scores. Boys in the second year of Arabic had significantly lower classroom anxiety than girls, and students in Grade 7 had higher reader self-perception than those in Grade 8. Classroom anxiety, language motivation, and reader self-perception significantly predicted Arabic achievement. Pedagogical implications are discussed.

The interview gathered information on acculturation and risk behaviors including smoking, alcohol use and number of sexual partners.

US residence and higher acculturation level was marginally associated with having more than one sexual partner. There were no differences between odds of smoking among Chavinda and Madera women. While results with acculturation are not consistently significant due to small sample sizes, the results are suggestive that acculturation among immigrant Hispanic women in the US may be associated with adverse health behaviors, and selective migration seems less likely to account for these differences.

A nationwide adult probability sample (N = 2360) included Finnish repatriates and Russian and Estonian immigrants from the former Soviet Union, Russia, and Estonia. In the total sample, linguistic acculturation was directly and negatively related to psychological well-being. Increased acculturation also influenced well-being indirectly through an increase in perceived discrimination. Although acculturation also increased the use of ethnic and host support networks, the effect of these social support networks on well-being depended on the stress level. Particularly, the direct effect of acculturation on well-being disappeared and was instead mediated by social support networks when examining the more vulnerable subsamples of the study, i.e., women and those who perceived substantial discrimination. Higher levels of SES were linked to better well-being through increased health status. It was concluded that the acculturation process plays a dual role in psychological functioning and that it is important to ensure more directly not only immigrants' cultural but also their socioeconomic integration.

Methods: We surveyed 806 immigrant Latino farmworkers from Mexico and Central America in a rural agricultural community in California’s Central Valley. Findings: A total of 556 respondents were born in Mexico (272 men, 284 women) and 250 in Central America (135 men, 115 women). The majority entered the United States as young adults, with median age at immigration ranging from 20 (Mexican-born men) to 24 (Central American-born women). Nearly 95% of respondents were married or cohabiting. Median age for sexual debut was 18 for women and was younger for men (adjusted mean difference: –2.1 years, 95% CI: –2.6 to –1.7). Median number of lifetime sexual partners was 1 for women and greater for men (adjusted mean difference: 2.0 partners, 95% CI: 1.3-2.7). Contraception use was less likely among men and among Central American women compared to Mexico-born women. Among sexually active persons not using contraception, the most common reasons for nonuse were 'Don’t want to'/'Don’t like any' followed by desire to become or being pregnant. Women reported a median of 3 pregnancies; there were no significant differences based on respondents’ region of birth. Conclusions: This group of Latino immigrants demonstrated behaviors conducive to reproductive health: late sexual debut, few lifetime sexual partners, and high prevalence of marriage. Preventive education campaigns should focus on maintaining healthy behaviors, especially in men. Identifying groups with common provenance and cultural heritage may aid in maximizing acceptability and effectiveness of prevention programs.

According to regulatory focus theory, promotion-focused self-regulation is concerned with nurturance and accomplishment needs and involves the pursuit of wishes and aspirations. As such, it results in sensitivity to positive outcomes and to relative pleasure from gains. On the other hand, prevention-focused self-regulation is concerned with security needs and is directed at meeting duties and obligations. As such, it results in sensitivity to negative outcome and relative pain from losses. In Study 1, as predicted, the extent of promotion focus (i.e., a concern with accomplishment and the pursuit of ideals) predicted more positive attitudes to culturally similar and economically beneficial migrants, whereas the extent of prevention focus (i.e., concern with security and meeting obligations) predicted more negative attitudes to migrants who are culturally dissimilar. In Study 2 we replicated and extended these findings, showing that the extent of promotion focus and a lack of concern with threats predicted positive attitudes to both culturally similar and economically beneficial migrants, which, in the case of the latter group, was mediated by a focus on the benefits these migrants provide. In the case of culturally dissimilar migrants, the extent of promotion focus and a concern with gains predicted more positive attitudes. However, for economically less beneficial migrants, neither the extent of promotion nor prevention focus was a predictor. Only lower concerns with threat predicted more positive attitudes to this migrant group. The results are discussed with respect to other determinants of attitudes to migrants and the implications for migration and asylum-seeker policy.

Consequences of abusive supervision have not been studied among migrant workers whose status in the host country of work is dependent on maintaining the work contract. This study investigates abusive supervision in 247 Filipino migrant workers in Macau, who hold temporary work contracts and work visas to engage in various low-skilled work (e.g., domestic helper, security guard, etc.). The study tests a model representing the indirect consequences of abusive supervision on the self-esteem and acculturation orientation of migrant workers, in particular, on the tendency to reject their heritage culture in their attempt to acculturate in the host country. Mediation analysis indicated that abusive supervisory perceptions led to lower self-esteem (b = −.19), which in turn relates to tendency to reject their heritage culture as part of acculturation (b = −.45) [indirect effect = .08, 90 % CI .04, .15]. The rejection of heritage culture is interpreted as a coping response to the negative indirect consequences of abusive supervision perceptions that may be partly attributed to being a migrant Filipino worker. The results are discussed in terms of how the acculturation of migrant workers reflects aspects of their well-being that may be adversely affected by vocational-related stress in the host country.

It was suggested that traumatic encounters would directly influence stress-related outcomes, as well as indirectly influence them by undermining refugees’ ability to cope with acculturation challenges. Somali refugees to Canada (N = 90) consistently reported encountering trauma, which was related to poorer self-reported outcomes (trauma symptoms, depressive affect, physical health), and these relations were mediated by increased use of emotion-focused (especially avoidant) coping strategies. Trauma symptoms and multiple traumatic experiences were associated with an exaggerated morning cortisol rise, but with a blunted response to stressor reminder cues. This blunted cortisol reactivity among participants encountering prior trauma was mediated by their increased propensity to cope by means of passive resignation. Evidently, refugees were at risk for stress-related dysfunction long after migrating, and the diminished capacity to cope with acculturation challenges was particularly important in this regard.

The current study explored these sources of similarity, as well as the association of relationship standards with relationship satisfaction, by comparing intercultural couples (68 Chinese–Western couples) with two groups of monocultural couples (63 Western couples and 66 Chinese couples) across 2 countries of residence (China and Australia). Regardless of country of residence, Chinese couples rated Family Responsibility standards (e.g., relations with the extended family and maintaining relational harmony) as more important than Western couples. Western couples rated Couple Bond standards (e.g., the demonstration of love and caring) as more important than Chinese. Intercultural couples endorsed standards to an intermediate extent between the Chinese and Western couples. There was considerable similarity of partners’ standards within couples in all 3 groups of couples. Endorsement of Couple Bond standards and partner similarity on Family Responsibility standards were associated with relationship satisfaction across all 3 groups and both countries of residence. We conclude that cultural differences in endorsement of relationship standards show little acculturative change, at least in first-generation migrants. The substantial similarity in partners’ standards in intercultural couples seems to be due primarily to selection effects. The association of standards with satisfaction is remarkably similar across countries of residence and cultural groups.

Likewise, immigrants' acculturation and adjustment patterns into their new settings have obtained considerable attention from scholars. Previous meta-analyses have attempted to lay out the association between acculturation and different forms of adjustment, however, results of this previous research yields conflicting findings regarding the impact of acculturation on adjustment and the moderating effects of contextual factors effecting this relationship. On the other hand, previous meta-analyses have not focused on a specific population such as immigrant youth, examined the academic adjustment patterns, nor looked at the moderating effects of generational status, thus, the significance of the acculturation-adjustment relationship among immigrant youth has not yet been explained in the literature. The present meta-analysis yielded significant but small associations between acculturation and adjustment, whereas no confounding effects of other variables (type of acculturation measure, adjustment domain, culture of origin, generational status, age, and gender) were found on acculturation-adjustment relationship among immigrant youth. Thus, results indicated that immigrant youths who are acculturated are more likely to be adjusted regardless of the type of the acculturation measure, adjustment domain and culture of origin, generational status, age and gender of the individuals. Furthermore, current research advocates for greater application of studies examining acculturation and adjustment relationship among under-represented cultures by examining more contextual factors (generational status, socioeconomic status, immigration status etc.), which will provide more data for future meta-analytic research. Expedient implications for school counselors and counselor educators, and crucial recommendations for future research and effective school policies are provided.

Methods: We analyzed data from 313 pregnant Latina women at San Francisco General Hospital. The dependent variable was prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), categorized as underweight (<18.5), normal (18.5-24.9, reference), overweight (25-29.9), or obese (≥30). The independent variables were acculturation metrics, measured by acculturation index score, degree of Americanization, national origin subgroup, and the number of years residing in the United States. Results: One third of women were overweight, and one fifth were obese. Education (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81-0.96) was inversely associated with overweight, after adjusting for confounding variables. Longer residence in the United States (OR 1.08 for each additional year residing in the United States, 95% CI 1.02-1.15), older age (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.16), and higher gravidity, the total number of pregnancies (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.09-1.84), were significantly associated with obesity. Conclusions: One measure of acculturation, length of time residing in the United States, was associated with obesity among childbearing Latina women. Efforts to reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity in Latina women should not target recent immigrants but instead focus on long-term immigrants as well as women who are older and have low educational attainment and high gravidity.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the level of HRQOL and its relationships with social support, acculturative stress, and depression among Vietnamese immigrant women. Method: A total of 216 Vietnamese immigrant women residing in South Korea participated in the study. Participants completed a series of questionnaires, including measures of social support, acculturative stress, depression, and HRQOL. For statistical analyses, a path analysis was applied. Results: Social support, acculturative stress, depression, and HRQOL were interrelated. Acculturative stress and depression directly influenced the mental health component of HRQOL, whereas social support indirectly influenced HRQOL through acculturative stress and depression. Only depression directly influenced the physical health component of HRQOL. Conclusion: Results suggest that social support and acculturative stress are related factors in preventing depression and promoting HRQOL, especially mental health, among Vietnamese immigrant women.

For Muslim students, even 'secular' public schools are not a religion‐free space because their religious beliefs and values are central in their manner of living. To inquire more about these issues, an exploratory sequential design mixed‐method study was conducted that included focus groups and a survey addressing the public school experiences of Muslim adolescents in a Midwestern state in the United States and how those experiences are related to their academic achievement, educational aspirations, and psychological adjustment. Overall, the findings characterize this study's sample as coping well in the school context in terms of academic achievement, high educational expectations, and relatively low levels of psychological distress. However, those who experience greater frequency and severity of hassles at school report higher levels of psychological distress. In particular, the frequency of hassles associated with representing Islam, limited English competency, relations with both Muslim and non‐Muslim peers, and religious discrimination at school related to increased distress. Together, these findings suggest the importance of considering both individual and ecological determinants of wellbeing for Muslim adolescents. The findings also suggest the importance of looking more carefully at the sample, context, and time when the data were collected before making generalizations within or across cultural and/or religious groups.

This study aimed to explore how associations between acculturation and CV behaviors among Latinos vary by country of origin. Combined weighted data from the 2005 and 2007 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) were used to investigate associations between acculturation level and CV behaviors among Latinos by country of origin. Among all Latinos, increased acculturation was associated with more smoking, increased leisure-time physical activity, and greater consumption of fast foods, but no change in fruit/vegetable and less soda intake. These trends varied, however, by Latino sub-groups from different countries of origin.

Using mediation analysis, it was found that Christian religious identity was not significantly associated with prejudice at a bivariate level. However, when Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) was taken into account, Christians (compared with non-Christians) were less likely to hold negative attitudes toward asylum seekers in Australia. Inclusion of acculturation ideologies (assimilation, multiculturalism, and color-blindness) in the models indicated that the suppression effect was specific to RWA rather than due to other intergroup attitudes.

Prior to this study, it was unknown whether immigrant Nigerian children and adolescents aged 9 to 14 years are at higher risk for obesity as a result of acculturation after migrating to the United States. The purpose of this study, guided by the social cognitive theory, was to assess the risk factors that lead to increased childhood obesity in this at-risk population. Data were collected from 163 participants through a cross-sectional quantitative design involving the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System questionnaires, the body-mass index scale, and Stephenson's Multi-Group Acculturation Scale. Participants were recruited through flyers in a public setting. Descriptive statistics and multiple regression were used in the data analysis. The results indicated that multiple factors are responsible for high rates of obesity in this at-risk population, with results showing significant relationships between obesity and age ( p = .002), employment (p = .005), duration of residence in the United States (p < .0005), and dominant society immersion (p = .001). Recommendations include developing community-based education programs and policies that support healthy lifestyles and conducting further research that increases the scope of study. This study has implications for positive social change in that it may increase awareness of the value of exercise and healthier eating patterns in the Nigerian community and may support the Healthy People 2020 goal of improving life expectancy and reducing obesity in at-risk populations.

This study's goal is to compare reproductive health characteristics between Hispanic and non-Hispanic White (NHW) mothers and to determine whether those characteristics differ by Hispanic birth increases. Methods: State-based Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System 2002 data were used to compare Hispanic and NHW mothers of live-born infants overall and in tertiles of states with the highest and lowest Hispanic birth increases during 1998-2002. We calculated crude and adjusted risk ratios (RR) for each characteristic for Hispanics (N = 5,104) relative to NHWs (N = 22,608) and conducted t-tests to compare the RRs in high and low tertile groups. Results: Hispanic mothers are younger, of lower socioeconomic status, and less likely to receive early prenatal care. They smoke and drink less, breastfeed their infants more often, and report less preterm labor and hypertension during pregnancy, but may be at greater risk of gestational diabetes. When compared to states with smallest birth increases, Hispanics in states with the largest increases are more likely than NHWs to report healthy behavior, e.g., continued breastfeeding and normal BMI. However, they are more likely to report late prenatal care, hospitalization during pregnancy, and low socioeconomic status. A lower risk of hypertension is reported only by Hispanics in states with small birth increases. Conclusions: Reproductive health characteristics among Hispanic and NHW women differ, but Hispanic women more closely resemble NHW women in states with small increases in Hispanic births. Percent increase in Hispanic births may be a useful measure for states planning future program needs among Hispanic women and infants.

The authors posit that the acculturation orientation of immigrants determines their consumer loyalty to both ethnic and mainstream brands and stores. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of Hispanic consumers in the USA and consumers from the former Soviet Union in Israel, this study tests a model in which two acculturation continua, original culture maintenance and host culture adaptation, serve as antecedents for immigrants’ consumer loyalty. Findings: Acculturation determines the extent of immigrants’ consumer loyalty. Both acculturation continua are associated with distinct loyalty patterns that are similar across the two immigrant groups. Research limitations/implications: Despite sampling limitations, the paper demonstrates that immigrants’ acculturation orientation influences their loyalty to ethnic and mainstream brands and stores. Shared by ethnic consumers in two culturally diverse markets, this relationship transcends geographic boundaries. Practical implications: The results provide insights for marketers with respect to the development of segmentation and positioning strategies and tactical implementations that address the preferences of ethnic consumers. Social implications: This paper highlights the importance of understanding the unique needs of ethnic consumers and addressing them. Successful integration of immigrant consumers into the marketplace can also help in their integration into the host society at large.

This paradox, however, has not been examined simultaneously in relation to varying degrees of exposure to the receiving society and across multiple outcomes and risk factors. To advance knowledge on these issues, we analysed data of the Maternity Experiences Survey, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of 6421 Canadian women who delivered singleton infants in 2006-07. We compared the prevalence of adverse pregnancy outcomes and related risk factors according to women’s ethnicity and time since migration to Canada. We calculated prevalences and prevalence ratios (PR) with 95% confidence intervals. Compared to Canadian-born women of European descent, recent immigrants were at lower risk of preterm delivery and morbidity during pregnancy despite having the highest prevalence of low income and low support during pregnancy among all groups, but the paradox was not observed among immigrants with a longer stay in Canada. In contrast, recent immigrants were at higher risk of postpartum depression. Immigrants of non-European origin also had higher prevalence of postpartum depression, irrespective of their length of residence in Canada, but immigrants from European-origin countries did not. Exposure to Canada was also positively associated with higher alcohol and tobacco consumption and body mass index. Canadian-born women of non-European descent were at higher risk of preterm birth and hospitalisation during pregnancy than their European-origin counterparts. Our findings suggest that the healthy migrant hypothesis and the immigrant paradox have limited generalisability. These hypotheses may be better conceptualised as outcome-specific and dependent on immigrants’ ethnicity and length of stay in the receiving country.

This project was an effort to expand our understanding of the impact of acculturation in the workplace and on workplace practices, particularly on the rapidly growing number of diversity programs. A sample of 150 Armenian immigrants (8 Assimilated, 32 Separated, and 109 Bicultural Armenians) living in the United States of America participated in this study. The participants completed a series of questionnaires including: (1) a reward allocation questionnaire which measured reward distribution preferences, (2) the Pan-Acculturation Scale (Soriano, 1999) which identified participants' acculturation type, (3) the Values Scale (Singelis et al., 1995) which assessed the participants' cultural patterns in terms of vertical and horizontal individualism and collectivism, (4) the Group Characteristics Questionnaire (Ferdman & Horenczyk, 2000) which determined the strength of ethnic identity with respect to the Armenian and American cultures, and (5) a demographic questionnaire. The hypotheses concerning participants' choice of equity-based or equality-based allocation style varying based on acculturation type was not supported. Essentially, Assimilated, Separated, and Bicultural Armenian immigrants did not demonstrate a significant difference in preferences for reward allocations. The hypotheses concerning the interaction between type of acculturation and workgroup ethnic composition in preferences for reward allocations was also not supported in that Bicultural Armenian immigrants did not differ in their reward allocation preferences based on the workgroup ethnic composition. An unexpected finding in the data set was that Separated and Bicultural respondents preferred the Horizontal Individualism (HI) cultural pattern whereas the Assimilated respondents preferred the Horizontal Collectivism (HC) cultural pattern. The results of this empirical research show preliminary evidence of within-group differences among Armenian immigrants. The results demonstrated that the Vertical Individualism cultural value is significantly related to preferences for equity over equality (r = .31, p < .000). This is an important contribution to cross-cultural psychological literature in that it establishes a connection between cultural values and preferences in reward allocations. In addition, this finding is an important one for employers to take note of. In order to maximize motivating factors, employers must ensure that the rewards will lead to the desired results. To this end, employers must be open to researching and identifying what motivates their employees by diversifying the types of rewards and the manners in which they are distributed.

Between 1990 and 2000, immigration into the United States by African-born immigrants increased by 130%. Of this immigrant population, individuals from Ethiopia make up a significant portion. Although there is a rich literature addressing the beliefs regarding HIV and risk perception among some immigrant populations in the United States, few studies target Ethiopian-born residents. Thus, a survey-based study addressing demographics, acculturation, awareness, beliefs and risk perception, attitudes toward susceptibility for infection, and risk behaviors targeted Ethiopian-born residents of San Diego, California. Results indicate a separation between understanding of HIV transmission and personal risk perception for infection in a young, highly educated, predominantly male participant pool. As an initial study of HIV beliefs and risk perception in the immigrant Ethiopian population, our results provide information on specific areas warranting further investigation.

Surinam is a former Dutch colony in South America. Methods: We randomly selected men and women aged 35-60 years: ethnic Dutch, n = 552; South Asian, n = 306; Afro-Caribbean, n = 660. Intakes of fruit, vegetables, red meat, fish, vegetable oils, breakfast and salt were measured using a short questionnaire that formed the basis for a 'diet quality indicator' score. Highest education was measured and acculturation of the Surinamese groups was assessed by age at migration, number of resident years and a scale measure of social contacts with ethnic Dutch. Results: Compared with ethnic Dutch, both Surinamese groups scored higher on overall diet quality (P ≤ 0.001) but some aspects of diet (breakfast and salt use) were less prudent. Education was positively associated with diet quality in ethnic Dutch (P ≤ 0.01), but not consistently so in Surinamese. Associations with social contact with ethnic Dutch varied for different quality aspects of the diet. Residence duration (mean = 22 years) and age at migration (mean = 21 years) were not associated with diet. Conclusions: A greater degree of acculturation does not necessarily lead to a less healthful diet in migrants. In addition, the association of education level with diet may differ for migrant groups. The diet of migrants differ from host populations, suggesting that migrant groups should be considered in the development of nutrition health promotion activities.

Somali, Latino, and Hmong adolescents in Minnesota provided data as part of the EAT 2010 (Eating and Activity in Teens) cohort study (N = 1,066). Acculturation was based on nativity, language usually spoken at home, and length of residence in the United States. Chi-square, ANOVA, and regression models were used to test for differences in adolescent well-being by acculturation and ethnic group, and interaction terms were added to models to test effect modification by ethnicity. Hmong adolescents had the highest mean acculturation scores (4.4 ± 1.5), whereas Somali adolescents (2.2 ± 1.8) were the least acculturated. Independent of ethnicity, acculturation was positively associated with marijuana (OR: 1.38; CI [1.25, 1.53]) and alcohol use (OR: 1.12; CI [1.02, 1.22]), and was negatively associated with academic achievement, based on grade point average (β = −0.07; CI [−0.12, −0.03]). Interaction effects indicated significant differences by ethnicity only for academic achievement; significant associations between acculturation and academic achievement were evident only for Somali and Latino youth.

Given the lack of empirical research supporting this policy, this article examines the association between the ethnic composition of schools and native and immigrant students' interethnic friendships, social participation, and sense of belonging in school. Blau's structural theory offers the theoretical rationale for these associations and the coherence of the three indicators. Multilevel analyses of data from a 2004-05 survey of 11,872 students, 1,324 of whom were immigrant students, in a sample of 85 Flemish secondary schools demonstrate that school ethnic composition is associated with interethnic friendships and social participation for native students, but not for immigrant students, whereas socioeconomic status is decisive for immigrant students' interethnic friendships. Neither immigrants' nor natives' sense of belonging in school is associated with ethnic composition. Hence, while the findings do not provide support for either school segregation or desegregation policies aimed at improving the social integration of immigrant students, mixing schools appears to have a positive influence on the social integration of Flemish youths. The consequences of these findings for future research and social policy are discussed in the conclusions.

Although emerging immigrant communities represent a widespread and significant national trend, little is known about the educational implications of this demographic shift. This study examines organizational adaptation in the context of emerging immigrant communities, with a particular focus on schools serving members of a New Latino Diaspora. This study addresses the following two research questions: 1) In communities experiencing a rapid increase in their Latino immigrant population, what practices constitute the school response? 2) How do environmental and organizational factors influence this process of organizational adaptation? While a growing body of education research offers case studies of schools serving members of the New Latino Diaspora, this study contributes a statewide perspective through an electronic survey of administrators and educators across the state of Wisconsin. This approach supports previously unexamined comparisons across contexts and analysis of policy implications for schools serving emerging immigrants. Specifically, data for analysis included school enrollment data from 1998 to 2008, approximately 110 principal and 150 teacher surveys, and state policy documents. Analysis included descriptive and inferential statistics, as well as textual analysis of comments. Areas of organizational adaptation discussed were human resources and professional capacity, the design and delivery of support services, and the social integration of immigrant students and their families. Findings suggest that some schools respond proactively, while others struggle to adapt. This study concludes with implications for policy, practice, and future research.

Civil war and forced migration may affect individuals' mental health. Traumatic experiences in particular are assumed to represent a major barrier, e.g., to labor-market integration. This study aimed to screen the rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Former refugee studies have reported PTSD screening rates between 3% and 44%. Method: A total of 8.5% (N = 175 of 2057) of respondents were randomly interviewed either by telephone or web-based interviews. A total of 84 respondents (48% out of 175 respondents) were screened using the Essen Trauma Inventory (ETI) based on the DSM-IV, and 91 (52%) respondents used the Short Screening Scale for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (SSS-PSD). All respondents were additionally questioned regarding psychological impairment (Symptom Checklist 10) and health status (Short Form 12). Results: Of the respondents, 59.4% reported at least one traumatic experience. The percentage of positive PTSD screenings obtained using the ETI was 9.5% (N = 84) and 6.6% (N = 91) using the SSS-PSD. The percentage of positive PTSD screenings obtained with both screening instruments was 8% (N = 175; 95%-CI: 3.9% to 12.1%). A total of 19.4% of the subjects were above the SCL-10 cut-off for psychiatric caseness. Discussion: The PTSD rate in this sample was in the average range compared to previous estimates from large samples of refugees. Psychiatric caseness was high. The results should be considered for planning labor-market integration programs and the design of supportive schemes.

Findings indicate that Latino respondents who were born outside of the US and who have a preference for communicating in Spanish, relative to English, were more likely to express comprehension difficulties. These findings suggest that pretest survey instruments with immigrant populations may be a useful strategy for identifying problematic questions.

This study explored SLA across different social contexts in a sample of 190 adult immigrants from Latin America to Australia who spoke Spanish as their first language (L1) and English as their second language (L2). The aims were to (a) investigate the presence and severity of SLA among L2 long-term immigrants, and (b) examine sources of individual differences in SLA. Results indicated that SLA exists among L2 immigrants at moderate, high and very high levels, and that levels of anxiety vary significantly across social contexts. Self-perceived L2 proficiency was found to be the strongest predictor of SLA followed by extroversion and age, with higher scores on all three variables associated with lower SLA. Gender, education level, duration of residency in Australia, and emotional stability did not predict SLA in any of the contexts. These findings suggest that SLA is a significant problem for adult immigrants, permeating most aspects of their everyday lives.

In line with the view that cross-cultural adaptation and second language (L2) learning are social and interpersonal phenomena, the present study examines the hypothesis that migrants’ L2 social network size and interconnectedness predict CRAS. The main idea underlying this hypothesis is that L2 social networks play an important role in fostering social and cultural aspects of communicative competence. Specifically, higher interconnectedness may reflect greater access to unmodified natural cultural representations and L2 communication practices, thus fostering communicative competence through observational learning. As such, structural aspects of migrants’ L2 social networks may be protective against acculturative stress arising from chronic communication difficulties. Results from a study of first generation migrant students (N = 100) support this idea by showing that both inclusiveness and density of the participants’ L2 network account for unique variance in CRAS but not in general acculturative stress. These results support the idea that research on cross-cultural adaptation would benefit from disentangling the various facets of acculturative stress and that the structure of migrants’ L2 network matters for language related outcomes. Finally, this study contributes to an emerging body of work that attempts to integrate cultural/cross-cultural research on acculturation and research on intercultural communication and second language learning.

In the working environment, these threats are known as acculturation demands, which are dynamic work conditions which have the potential to hinder an immigrant from having or doing what he or she wants (Bhagat & London, 1999). Despite an influx of immigrants in the workplace in the United States, there is still limited research on the effects of acculturation demands on immigrant employees in the host culture. Using Berry's (1997) theoretical framework on the acculturation process, the study examined the moderating effects of harmony enhancement and cultural identity salience and the mediating effects of ostracism and social support on the relationship between acculturation demands, acculturation strategies, job strains and employee outcomes. Based on a time lagged design across two time points, each a one month apart, results showed acculturation demands was positively related to anxiety, depression, turnover intentions, assimilation, marginalization and separation acculturation strategies and negatively related to engagement and affective commitment. Multiple moderated regression analysis, showed support for the moderating effect of harmony enhancement but not cultural identity salience. Additionally, integration strategy was the most favorable strategy, while marginalization was the most detrimental. It should be noted that integration subscale of the acculturation strategies scale had an alpha level of .54, therefore results should be interpreted with caution. There was also an indirect effect of social support on the relationship between integration and acculturation demands, while ostracism mediated the relationship between anxiety and both marginalization and separation strategies. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings as well as limitation and future research are discussed in this study.

The final sample consisted of 40 Turkish migrant children, 56 German urban middle-class children, 47 German rural children, 61 Turkish urban middle-class children, and 21 Turkish rural children. The children of the five cultural milieus did not differ in age, gender distribution, or human figure drawing ability. Besides the drawings, the mothers’ sociocultural orientation was assessed, as well as migrant mothers’ involvement in the German and Turkish cultures. The results revealed similarities between Turkish migrant children's self- and family-depictions with those of children from their culture of origin, particularly in some categorical features such as gender-specific characteristics, torso type, and neighbors. On the other hand, however, the drawings differed from those of Turkish rural children in the size of the depicted self. These findings are in line with the specific ecocultural context and the cultural orientation of Turkish migrant families toward psychological autonomy and hierarchical relatedness. It can therefore be concluded that Turkish migrant children's drawings are influenced by both their culture of origin, probably mediated by their familial socialization, and their social experiences in Germany.

One-hundred-and-sixty-two Polish immigrants (mean age=31.3 years, SD=7.28) living in Rome participated in the study. The majority of the participants (66.0%) were females. A Questionnaire containing scales for assessing Sociocultural adaptation, Psychological adaptation, Attitudes towards social relationships with Italians and Poles, and Self-monitoring was administered. Using adaptation indices as criteria in moderated multiple regression analyses, we found main effects of self-monitoring and of assimilation and integration strategies, and interactive effects of self-monitoring and assimilation or integration strategy. Self-monitoring was positively related both to sociocultural and psychological adaptation in all the regressions. Assimilation and integration strategies in most of cases were also positively related to both types of adaptation. Such main effects, however, were qualified by the interactive effects. As far as sociocultural adaptation is concerned, simple slope analysis showed that: (a) the positive effect of choosing assimilation is much stronger for high self-monitor immigrants than for low self-monitor ones; (b) the effect of choosing integration is positive for low self-monitor immigrants, but negative for high self-monitor ones.

Julia","Self-regulation in context: An ecocultural perspective on self-regulation during problem solving.",0,"not migration","This dissertation addresses the process-pathways running between immigrant adolescents' life experiences and their engagement in school by providing an ecocultural perspective on self-regulation. While the role of social context, such as stress and resources, has been identified as critical in its influence on different dimensions of adolescent development, research on its effect on cognitive self-regulation1 is limited. This thesis investigates the influence of immigrant adolescents' social context on their self-regulation during problem solving in school. In addition, it also provides a preliminary consideration of the role of cultural resources, practices and beliefs in this process. I propose that self-regulation is a process connecting immigrant adolescent developmental experiences and their school-related outcomes. Study participants were public high school students (15 male, 22 female) aged 14-19 years (N=37) who recently immigrated to the United States. Survey data on participants' stress experiences (life events, and perceived neighborhood, acculturation, and racialization stress), perceived Social Support and Integration, and individual difference factors (depression, trait anxiety, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) were collected. During an interrupted time-series problem solving task participants' self-regulation, momentary affect, and biophysiological markers of stress (alpha;-amylase) were assessed. Structured qualitative interviews were conducted with a subset of the sample (N=18). The findings are consistent with the ecocultural model the study was based on. Adaptive self-regulatory strategy choice was predicted by less life stress, more social support and integration, and more momentary negative affect. Conversely, goal termination was predicted by more life stress, less social support, and less momentary positive affect. Secondly, the analysis of momentary change provides evidence that self-regulation is adjusted momentarily and in agreement with changing context conditions. Thirdly, the findings indicate that participants with higher experiences of context stress respond to a situational stress condition with significantly more negative affect and suggest, if don't establish, the increased use of maladaptive self-regulation strategies. Lastly, an exploratory investigation of the role of cultural resources for affective self-regulation identified a range of resources, practices and beliefs particular to this ecocultural setting. 1Self-regulation includes the setting of goals and their pursuit through the management of affect, thought and behavior.

This study compared prognostic communication with immigrants (with and without interpreters) versus native-born patients in audio-taped oncology consultations. Methods: Ten oncologists, 78 patients (31 Australian-born, 47 immigrants) and 115 family members participated. The first two consultations after diagnosis of incurable disease were audiotaped, transcribed and coded. 142 consultations were included in the analysis. Results: Fifty percent of doctor and 59% of patient prognostic speech units were not interpreted or interpreted non-equivalently when an interpreter was present. Immigrant status predicted few prognostic facts, and oncologist characteristics no prognostic facts, disclosed. Oncologists were significantly less likely to convey hope to immigrants (p = 0.0004), and more likely to use medical jargon (p = 0.009) than with Australian-born patients. Incurable disease status and a limited life span were commonly acknowledged, generally with no timeframe provided. Physical issues were discussed more commonly than emotional aspects. Conclusions: While culture did not appear to influence doctor speech, interpreters filtered or blocked much prognostic communication. Practice implications: Initiatives to empower all patients to attain needed information, optimise communication when an interpreter is present and train cancer health professionals in culturally appropriate care, are urgently required.

A concurrent mixed-method nested, quantitative dominant design was employed. A comparison between actual and perceived sibling acculturation discrepancy was also examined as well as differences between Vietnamese and Chinese young adults on the key study variables. Thematic analysis of the qualitative data was conducted to further shed light on the quantitative findings. Two samples were collected: the main data set comprised of 150 Vietnamese and Chinese young adults and the sibling pairs data set comprised of 18 pairs of siblings. Questionnaires on self-reported and perceived bilinear acculturation, sibling relationship quality, psychological adjustment, intercultural adjustment difficulties and demographic data were administered online. Qualitative data was collected using eight open-ended questions regarding sibling acculturation discrepancy and sibling relations. Quantitative results showed that sibling acculturation discrepancy uncorrelated with psychological adjustment or intercultural adjustment difficulties. Further, sibling conflict moderated the relationship between perceived sibling heritage acculturation discrepancy and intercultural competence difficulties and predicted psychological adjustment. Analyses also revealed that siblings accurately perceived acculturation discrepancies. Further, actual and perceived acculturation discrepancy were both associated with psychological adjustment and intercultural competence difficulties. Finally, Chinese young adults were more likely to report higher heritage acculturation and sibling warmth than Vietnamese young adults. Qualitative results revealed seven themes of which three were related to the quantitative results. First, siblings defined acculturation in both multi-factorial and bilinear terms. A multi-factorial and bilinear approach to acculturation measurement may have enhanced the present study. In addition, siblings were aware of differences in acculturation between themselves, but they employed many strategies to cope with perceived acculturation differences to help mitigate sibling conflict and distress. The association between sibling conflict and psychological adjustment found in this study may be related to the way siblings cope with acculturation differences. This study expands upon the acculturation gap-distress model to include siblings as an important context within which to study immigrant adjustment and adaptation. The implications of its findings are discussed.

Organizational practices, culture, and emerging opportunities for women and minorities in a shrinking Japan.",0,"not migrant","Japan's population is rapidly contracting. If current trends continue, its population will fall to just one third of its 2010 peak by as early as 2095, with even faster declines in the working age population. Scholars are unsure how population contractions in Japan and the rest of the developed world will alter or uphold existing status hierarchies. On one hand, those at the top of the economic hierarchy may strengthen their grip on a shrinking number of good jobs. Alternatively, labor shortages may create new opportunities for formerly disadvantaged people. In three papers this dissertation examines the forms and causes of economic inequality in the context of Japan's demographic decline. It uses original data collected from 539 white collar workers at twelve large Japanese firms. The first paper on gender inequality finds little evidence that firms exclude women from good jobs. However, within jobs, firms continue to pay women less than men, even after adjustments for performance. The results indicate that labor shortages do induce firms to admit more women to good jobs, but may even increase their incentives to discriminate against them within jobs. The second paper compares economic outcomes for skilled foreign workers and their Japanese counterparts. After adjustments for acculturation and human capital quality, the data show that Western immigrants to Japan earn more even than Japanese doing similar jobs, while East Asians earn less. This pattern of stratification suggests that context of reception---particularly the attitudes of Japanese people towards members of different groups---is more influential in generating stratification within firms than the acculturation of foreign workers. The third paper tests directly whether ethnic and racial attitudes matter for inequality between Japanese and foreign workers. Using the results of a survey experiment on attitudes, I show that in firms where coworkers are more biased against non-Japanese East Asians, inequality between Japanese and other Asians is greater. Similarly, in firms where coworkers demonstrate more pro-Western bias, Western employees are at a greater wage advantage. Together, the three papers show that, in a context of demographic decline, outsiders do move into good jobs, but do not overturn existing status hierarchies.

The purpose of this study was to examine relationships between acculturation and features of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in Mexican and Mexican–American women (n = 60) living in the largest US-Mexico border community. Acculturation was measured by the short acculturation scale for Hispanics and birthplace. Body composition was measured by Bod Pod and daily physical activity was measured by questionnaire and accelerometer. Increased acculturation was related to individual features of MetS and increased risk of MetS. These relationships were mediated by fat mass rather than inactivity. Fat mass mediates the relationships between acculturation and individual features of MetS in young Mexican and Mexican–American women. These findings suggest that fat mass, rather than inactivity, is an important contributor to disease risk in young Mexican and Mexican–American women living in a large US/Mexico border community.

Previous studies have suggested that elevated rates of depression among different migrant groups might be due to patterns of acculturation and migration related risk factors. This paper focused on prevalence rates of depressive disorders and related risk factors among individuals with Turkish migration backgrounds. Methods: A population-based sample of 662 individuals with Turkish migration backgrounds were interviewed by bilingual interviewers using a standardised diagnostic interview for DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 diagnoses (CIDI DIA-X Version 2.8). Associations between 12-month prevalence rates of depressive disorders with potential risk factors were assessed, including gender, age, socioeconomic status, acculturation status and migration status. Results: 12-month prevalence rates of any depressive disorder were 29.0%, 14.4% of major depressive disorder (MDD) and 14.7% of dysthymia. Older age and low socioeconomic status were most consistently related to higher risks of depressive disorders. Acculturation status showed associations with subtypes of depressive disorder. Associations differed between men and women. Symptom severity of MDD was linked to gender, with females being more affected by severe symptoms. Conclusion: The prevalence of depressive disorders is high in individuals with Turkish migration backgrounds, which can be partly explained by older age, low socioeconomic status and acculturation pressures. Only a limited number of risk factors were assessed. Acculturation in particular is a complex process which might not be sufficiently represented by the applied measures. Further risk factors have to be identified in representative samples of this migrant group.

The dependent variable in this study was acculturative stress while the independent variables included measures of social capital described as constructs based on factor analysis and demographic variables. Five hypotheses were generated, and data was collected from 326 Iraqi Christians residing in Southern Ontario, Canada, who completed a set of questionnaires administrated by the researcher of this study. Three layers of analysis were implemented to test each hypothesis. The first layer tested the predictability of social-capital constructs and the demographic variables on the overall acculturative-stress score. Using logistic regression, an 'Acculturative Stress Main Model' was developed to test the predictability of the social-capital constructs and demographic variables on the overall acculturative-stress score. A binary score was created by splitting the sum of responses to all acculturative stress at the median score. The range of the acculturative-stress sum score was 1 to 100 with a median score of39. This means participants showed a moderate level of acculturative stress. The second layer of the analysis investigated the specific interrelationships between the independent variables and each individual construct of the acculturative stress instrument. This layer of the analysis provided a better understanding of the complex relationships between the dependent and independent variables. For this purpose, six logistic regression models were developed: (1) AS experiencing stereotypes, (2) AS change in values, (3) AS language competencies, (4) AS feeling unappreciated , (5) AS experiencing discrimination, (6) AS identification with country of origin. Each model tested an individual construct of acculturative stress as a dependent variable and against the independent variables of the study (age, education, gender, income, and the six social-capital constructs). A binary score was computed for each acculturative-stress construct, and the distribution was split at the median within each construct. The third layer evaluated each factor from the social-capital instrument and the demographic variables as predictors on the binary outcome for the individual construct of acculturative stress by splitting the sample according to gender to understand the source of stress for each gender. The results of this study in relation to the first, second, fourth, and, fifth hypotheses were consistent with existing social-capital literature on health, which considers social capital as resources that reduce psychological stressors and improve the health and well-being of individuals. In effect, because the participants of this study enjoy social capital, they do not experience high level of acculturative stress. The moderate level of acculturative stress they do experience is due to their interaction with people from the dominant culture. However, the results of this study in relation to the third hypothesis were inconsistent with previous literature. This is one of the few studies that introduces the concept of social capital to the field of social work, considering social capital as a source of social integration and as means of economic success. Social capital is also essential for policy development to support diversity inclusion and social cohesion in a multicultural society. This study connects the concept of social capital to the psychological health of immigrants by considering social capital as a predictive factor of acculturative stress. This investigation developed its acculturation model as involving three levels of interaction by the immigrant.

Furthermore, older and Spanish adolescents displayed lower levels of intrinsic satisfaction than younger and immigrant adolescents. Path analyses found that social self-efficacy and academic self-concept were the best predictors of intrinsic satisfaction. Therefore, the promotion of social self-efficacy and academic self-concept should increase intrinsic satisfaction in schools.

How inclusive a society is for immigrants can be answered by comparing the inclusion of immigrants to near-culture host society and those to a different-culture society. This paper reports the social inclusion and their correlation with health conditions among Chinese immigrants in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. Two non-probability sample surveys were conducted using the Social and Communities Opportunities Profile and its Chinese version as survey instruments. Altogether 56 new arrivals in Hong Kong and 51 immigrants in UK were recruited through NGOs to participate in face-to-face individual interviews. Both Hong Kong and UK participants reported high overall social inclusion. The two sub-samples shared many similarities in the perceived opportunities and satisfaction of opportunities in various social domains. There was evidence that immigrants in a host society with similar language demonstrated higher perceived satisfaction with opportunities in contact with friends and family, as well as higher perceived opportunities for community involvement than immigrants in a society with a different language. However, overall social inclusion appeared to be independent of one’s health conditions.

Aim: To explore the relationship between acculturation and psychological distress among first-generation Muslim migrants from Turkey and Morocco in the Netherlands. Methods: A cross-sectional study. Respondents were interviewed in their preferred language. Acculturation was measured with the Lowlands Acculturation Scale (LAS) and psychological distress with the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Data were complete for 321 subjects and analyzed with multivariate linear regression. Results: Less skills for living in Dutch society was associated with distress (p = 0.032). Feelings of loss were related to distress among Moroccans (p = 0.037). There was an interaction between traditionalism and ethnic background ( p = 0.037); traditionalism was related to less distress among Moroccans (p = 0.020), but not among Turkish. Finally, there was an interaction by gender among Turks (p = 0.029); conservative norms and values seemed to be related to distress among men (p = 0.062), not women. Conclusion: Successful contact and participation in Dutch society, and maintenance of heritage culture and identity were moderately associated with less psychological distress. Improving mastery of the dominant language in host societies, and allowing migrants to preserve their traditions, might be effective measures in improving the mental well-being of migrants.

Although there is substantial evidence demonstrating their existence, little is known about their change over time in adolescents. Purpose: The objectives of this paper were to identify longitudinal changes in a syndemic of substance use, intimate partner violence, and depression and determine whether immigration/cultural factors moderate this syndemic over time. Methods: In a cohort of 772 pregnant Latina adolescents (ages 14–21) in New York City, we examined substance use, intimate partner violence, and depression as a syndemic. We used longitudinal mixed-effect modeling to evaluate whether higher syndemic score predicted higher syndemic severity, from pregnancy through 1 year postpartum. Interaction terms were used to determine whether immigrant generation and separated orientation were significant moderators of change over time. Results: We found a significant increasing linear effect for syndemic severity over time (β = 0.0413, P = 0.005). Syndemic score significantly predicted syndemic severity (β = –0.1390, P ≤ 0.0001), as did immigrant generation (βImmigrant = –0.1348, P ≤ 0.0001; β1stGen = –0.1932, P = 0.0005). Both immigrant generation (βImmigrant = –0.1125, P = 0.0035; β1stGen = –0.0135, P = 0.7279) and separated orientation (β = 0.0946, P = 0.0299) were significantly associated with change in severity from pregnancy to 1 year postpartum. Conclusion: Pregnancy provides an opportunity for reducing syndemic risk among Latina adolescents. Future research should explore syndemic changes over time, particularly among high-risk adolescents. Prevention should target syndemic risk reduction in the postpartum period to ensure that risk factors do not increase after pregnancy.

The study also employed focus groups to seek (a) community explanation of the quantitative results, and (b) community views of acculturation challenges and opportunities. A sample of 124 first-generation Somali immigrants living in two large U.S. Midwest cities participated in the study. Results indicated significant relationship between the acculturation strategies used by the Somali immigrants and their SW. Integration was related to the highest SW, while marginalization was related to the lowest SW. However, the study found no significant differences in the SW of the Somali genders. Additionally, the focus groups revealed that youth problems were the greatest threats to the community well-being. Finally, while results highlighted some important acculturation issues affecting the well-being of the Somali immigrants, further investigations are encouraged to understand better the acculturation process of the Somali immigrants.

Specifically, social support was considered a moderator for decreasing acculturative stress and increasing post-migration health. Acculturative stress was considered a mediator variable for pre-migration experiences and post-migration health. Cross-sectional quantitative data was collected via online survey method. A total of 109 first generation immigrants completed questionnaires. Preliminary analyses were conducted which led to hierarchical regression model and path modeling. Major findings revealed social support as a marginally significant moderator for acculturative stress and post-migration mental health. Additional results demonstrated key variables connected to pre-migration experiences including; age at migration, desire to come to the United States and continent of heritage culture. The current study highlighted the need to gain an overall better understanding of pre-migration preparation and factors that increase or decrease pre-migration planning.

Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with depressive symptoms based on a score of ≥21 on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale. Lower household income, interference of diabetes with daily activities, and more T2D clinical symptoms were associated with depression risk in the multivariate analyses. At each level of food insecurity the risk of depression was lower the higher the level of social support (P < 0.05).

The first is Immersion within the Society of Origin (ISO), which has two facets: 'Orientation towards Members of the Ingroup' (OMI) and 'Orientation towards the culture of origin' (OCO). The second, 'Immersion within the Host Society' (IHS) also comprises two facets: 'Orientation towards People of French Origin' (OPFO) and 'Orientation towards French Culture' (OFC). The aim was to analyze the relationship between these four facets of sociocultural acculturative orientations and various socio-demographic and psychosocial variables. Two-hundred-and-ten North African immigrants in France answered a questionnaire adapted from Stephenson's Multi group Acculturation Scale (SMAS). Stepwise multiple regression analyses show that OMI is linked to the country of origin and cultural identity, and OCO to satisfaction with life, family situation, sex and cultural identity. OPFO is linked to participation in club activities, and OFC to work/student activity and family situation. These results illustrate the relevance and value of studying immigrants' sociocultural, acculturative orientation on the basis of ISO vs. IHS models, and in the fields of their social relations and their relationship with the culture. They highlight the importance of looking at acculturation as a composite process, the various facets of which are related to different variables that can therefore be regarded as relevant indicators of immigrants' intercultural adaptation.

The healthy migrant hypothesis and the acculturation hypothesis, stating that the foreign-born and the less acculturated enjoy better health, have been proposed as possible complementary explanations. However, it is not clear which are the socioeconomic, cultural, and personal characteristics that favor good health and that differentiate foreign-born from US-born and unacculturated from acculturated Mexicans. In this paper, we compare, by nativity and acculturation level, the socioeconomic, cultural, and personal characteristics in a sample of low income mostly female Mexican-origin individuals living in Texas and investigate their contribution to differences in self-reported physical health, mental health, and self-rated health (SRH) status. Using a multistage probability sample, we completed 1745 interviews with Mexican-origin individuals. The survey instrument included the SF-12, demographic and socioeconomic information, and questions on social support, religiosity, fear of victimization, trust, perceived racism, and perceived opportunity. Nativity and use of the Spanish language were combined into a nativity/acculturation variable. We estimated multivariate regressions and ordered logit regressions to investigate the association of health outcomes to nativity/acculturation and socioeconomic, cultural, and personal characteristics. Overall, the distribution of strengths (more social support, trust, perceived personal opportunities and less perceived victimization) reflected a nativity-based income gradient and an education gradient reflecting language use. Health outcomes varied by nativity/acculturation after controlling for socioeconomic, cultural, and personal characteristics. Physical health differed by nativity, supporting the healthy migrant hypothesis, while nativity-based differences in mental health were explained by socioeconomic and personal characteristics. SRH varied by language use, suggesting a culturally conditioned response. The socioeconomic, cultural, and personal factors affected health outcomes differently. These findings suggest a complicated interaction between nativity, acculturation, and economic factors in determining social and personal strengths and their influences on health.

Within the counseling profession, the latest demographic information (Data USA, 2017) reports that Caucasians make up 70.4% of counselors in the United States while African Americans make up 19.5%, Asians 3.4%, and shared ethnicity is 3 %. American Indians make up 0.6%, Hawaiian 0.1%, and the remainder (2.8%) are identified as 'other.' The immigration experience is marked by a sense of loss and a process of acculturation. However, there is scant literature that discusses the adjustment experiences of immigrant counselors (Kissil, Niño, & Davey, 2013), particularly examining acculturation and professional identity development. The purpose of this study was to provide insights on whether acculturation impacts professional identity and explore the overall acculturative and professional identity development experiences of foreign-born individuals in the counseling profession. A sequential explanatory mixed-methods design was used. The quantitative portion of the study was completed by 60 online participants. From those who participated, 37 fully completed the survey (N = 37). Professional identity was measured using the Professional Identity Scale in Counseling (Woo, 2013) and acculturation was measured using the American International Relations Scale (Sodowsky & Plake, 1991). Follow up phone interviews were conducted with 6 participants. Quantitative findings for this study suggest that while no significant correlation exists between overall acculturation scores as measured by the American International Relations Scale (AIRS) and professional identity scores as measured by the Professional Identity Scale in Counseling (PISC), several significant relationships were found between demographic variables. Thematic findings from the interviews are discussed and provide a rich understanding of acculturation being a dynamic process as well as the simultaneous nature of professional identity development and acculturation. Limitations are examined in detail with recommendations for future direction. Implications specific to counselor education were sorted into five categories: Continuous acculturation, foreigner imposter syndrome, boxed identity, western training philosophy, and promoting and diversifying the counseling field.

The moderating effect of multicultural personality traits.",NA,NA,"This study examines the role of trainable intercultural personality traits in the widely assumed link between immigrants’ second language (L2) learning and their cultural integration in the host country. The research was based on data of temporary immigrants (sojourners), being international students who reside in the Netherlands and participants of a Dutch language course (total N = 163). Questionnaires were used to collect data at two time points (time lag: 3 months). Findings from multiple regression analyses reveal that an increase in L2 proficiency is related to a positive change in two indicators of cultural integration: identification with the host society and attitudes towards the host culture. An increase in L2 proficiency appears to be related to a positive change in terms of identification, regardless of sojourners’ personality traits. With respect to attitudes towards the host culture, however, we find that increasing L2 proficiency only goes together with a positive change in attitudes towards the host culture for sojourners with a high degree of social initiative. Another notable finding is that, in the time period that this study was conducted, sojourners with a high degree of openness became more positive in their attitudes towards the host culture, regardless of the progress they made in terms of L2 proficiency. Results from this study cautiously suggest the importance of social perceptual personality traits in the cultural integration of sojourners. In line with this, institutional policies on the L2 learning of sojourners, including the training of social perceptual personality traits, could be recommendable.

In order to measure personality and psychopathology the MMPI-2-RF RC scales were utilized. This study was significant in its conceptualization of acculturation. The use of the RC scales has rarely been found, and it is the first time it is being employed with regard to a Greek-American community sample of first generation immigrants. Results indicated that lower mainstream-culture identification was associated with higher scores on Demoralization (RCd), Somatic Complaints (RC1), Cynicism (RC3), Ideas of Persecution (RC6), and Aberrant Behaviors (RC8); and lower heritage-culture identification was associated with higher scores on Somatic Complaints (RC1) to the direction of psychopathology. Individuals testing in the Separated category, that is, who continued to identify more with their heritage culture and less with their new (mainstream) culture experienced more somatic problems. The performance of the sample was in line with prior research, and the findings of this study are consistent with previous studies that found different levels of acculturation to have differential impact on the MMPI-2-RF performance, and studies that found higher identification with both mainstream culture and heritage culture were associated with more favorable mental health outcomes. Findings supported the premise that both mainstream and heritage cultures offer benefits for people living in and/or experiencing multiple cultures. In addition, the findings of this study indicated support for the bidimentional model of acculturation as most participants had a high identification with both mainstream and heritage cultures.

Background: Acculturation is an important indicator for immigrant health. Less empirical research has been conducted on the association between acculturation and breast cancer experience among Chinese immigrant women in the USA. Design: A mixed methods study. Methods: A total of 107 Chinese-American women with breast cancer completed the structured questionnaire survey, and 16 women completed face-to-face in-depth interviews. Results: In the quantitative findings, acculturation was related to health beliefs, social support and life stress. Cultural interpretations of the qualitative information are offered to show that breast cancer experience was intertwined with cultural adaptation in a given immigrant environment. Chinese cultural beliefs persistently, even after years of immigration, guide Chinese-American immigrant women to respond to breast cancer across the meaning of health and illness, family ties and involvement and social interaction. Conclusion: Our findings show that acculturation is related to health beliefs, social support and life stress in the trajectory of breast cancer adaptation among Chinese-American immigrant women. Life stresses derived from immigration bring additional difficulties for immigrant women living with cancer. Relevance to clinical practice: This study pinpoints that traditional cultural beliefs and immigration stress may influence Chinese-American women to cope with breast cancer. To promote culturally sensitive cancer care for immigrants, healthcare professionals should be aware of and learn intercultural competence. Ethnic social support or outreach healthcare programme may benefit new immigrant families or the immigrant families, who lack social connection, to cope with cancer.

The present study aimed to identify the association between dietary patterns and the metabolic syndrome (MS) in South Asians living in the UK. Methods: Dietary patterns were derived by principal component analysis from 15 different food groups using an ethnic-specific food frequency questionnaire. MS risk factors, including obesity and hypertension, were measured, whereas existing conditions of dyslipidaemia and hyperglycaemia were self-reported. Participants (n = 100) were divided into quartiles based on dietary factor scores and the link between dietary patterns and risk factors was investigated. Results: Three different patterns were derived, which together explained 46% of the total diet variation; eastern pattern, mixed pattern and western pattern. An inverse correlation was found between the eastern pattern and education P = 0.05). A direct correlation was found between the western pattern and physical activity (P = 0.05) and the overall risk of MS (P = 0.05). Body composition was altered as residence time in the UK increased, with a reduction in muscle mass (29–26%) and an increase in body fat (31–37%). Diagnosis criteria for MS were found in 20% of the participants. Conclusions: Dietary acculturation, including a reduction in vegetarianism, an increased intake of caffeinated drinks and altered meal patterns, may be associated with the higher prevalence of MS in migrant South Asians in the UK.

The difference in Asian Indian and American cultures creates a need for Asian Indians to acculturate, upon migration to the U.S. It has been theorized that acculturation becomes harder when the two cultures of contact are dissimilar. Particularly, immigrant women and children have been found to be more vulnerable than men to acculturative stress, where acculturative stress is defined as the psychological impact of adaptation to a new culture. Hence, this study focuses on acculturation of Asian Indian women and specifically on factors influencing their acculturation. Research findings from this study on acculturation of Asian Indian women provide information, useful for public policy makers. They have been utilized to develop a program (used by settlement service providers) designed specifically to facilitate acculturation of Asian Indian women in the U.S. A two-dimensional model developed by J.W. Berry, a prominent researcher in the field of acculturation, is employed to classify the acculturation process of Asian Indian women who were part of this study. Based on Berry’s model, the acculturation process of an immigrant can be described by one of the following four strategies: 1) Assimilation, 2) Integration, 3) Separation, or 4) Marginalization. According to Berry, the Integration strategy is considered the most effective acculturation strategy in terms of long-term health and wellbeing of the individual. This study employed a cross-sectional design, using quantitative methods for data analysis. Data were collected by means of a web-based acculturation survey that was developed as part of the study. Data analysis indicated that a majority of the Asian Indian women adopted the Integration strategy. A conceptual model was developed and multivariate analyses were conducted to examine the key acculturation factors that influenced Asian Indian women using the Integration strategy. These identified key factors helped to understand the cultural adaptation of Asian Indian women.

Taking the van de Vijver and Leung and the Poortinga and van de Vijver theories on bias in terms of culture as a starting point, a triple-fold paradigm employing factor analysis and other techniques is presented on: (a) the application of simple congruence coefficients in estimating factor similarity -that is, basic factor equivalence testing- along with a proposed method of taking advantage of the Tucker coefficient matrix for a set of two or more factor structures, (b) the within-country application of multilevel covariance structure analysis and Procrustean rotations for a set of between groups and pooled-within correlation matrices, and (c) the reduction of 'bias in terms of culture' by eliminating variance components through multivariate methods. By incorporating some of these methods in standard -within country- psychological research, we should be able to gain on theoretical and psychometric grounds and we may finally question the degree of construct similarity among groups within a country, which cannot be necessarily taken for granted. These considerations are closely related to the use of multilevel analyses, as these stem from Cross-Cultural Psychology through most forms of intracountry and/or inter-country comparisons.

Theory and research suggest that this achievement gap could be partially explained by stereotype threat. Stereotype threat is a detrimental psychological state that inhibits individuals who belong to a negatively stereotyped group at times of learning and performance. The aim of this work was to examine both the influence of students' residence culture identity strength and ethnic identity strength on their cognitive performance under threat. Two experimental studies, conducted in European secondary schools, are reported. Experiment 1 (N = 132) showed that in a situation of explicit stereotype threat, high identification of immigrants with their residence culture predicted better cognitive performance, independently of ethnic identity strength. Residence culture identity strength was unrelated to cognitive performance in a control condition or a more implicit threat condition. Experiment 2 (N = 152) included an experimental manipulation of residence culture identity strength. The results show that highlighting similarities with the residence culture (vs. highlighting differences) positively influences immigrant students' performance under threat. This research connects the stereotype threat framework with acculturation research, and points at ways to increase the educational achievement of immigrant students.

Objective: To determine the level of psychopathology in Latin-American immigrants who reside in Barcelona and its relationship to the coping strategies used to mitigate the effects of the stress linked to migration. Method: The sample comprised 210 Latin-American immigrants over the age of 18. Sampling was based on consecutive cases, and participants were contacted through an NGO. Results: Employment is the stressor that most affects immigrants. Psychopathological symptoms are common among the immigrant population, and there is a relationship between the use of avoidance coping strategies and greater symptomatology. The longer immigrants have been in the host country, the less they make use of approach strategies. Conclusions: The migratory process produces high levels of stress that are linked to psychopathology. Being subjected to a prolonged stressor has a destabilizing effect on both mental and physical health and can lead to a deterioration in social relationships due to more intense feelings of anger and frustration. Coping strategies appear to be more widely used among immigrants than in the indigenous population, and this may indicate the high levels of stress to which the former are subject and the attempts they make to deal with it. The limitations of the study include the source of data collection and the fact that most of the instruments used have not been validated in the participants’ countries of origin.

Whether psychosocial stress affects their eating behavior is unknown. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine psychosocial stress and dietary intake among 426 Chinese immigrant women in the Philadelphia region. Methods: Participants completed 4 days of dietary recalls and questionnaires assessing positive and negative life events in the past year and migration-related stressors. Results: In hierarchical linear regression models, positive life events were associated with higher energy intake (β = 21.1, p = 0.04). Migration-related stress was associated with lower total gram (β = −11.3, p < 0.0001) and overall grain (β = −0.18, p = 0.03) intake and higher energy density (β = 0.002, p = 0.04) and percent energy from fat (β = 0.06, p = 0.05). Conclusions: Migration-related stress did not increase overall intake in terms of energy and total grams but selectively increased fat intake and energy density. Such dietary habits may have implications for future chronic disease risk in this immigrant population.

Using data from a large dual frame sample of first generation Mandarin speaking Chinese immigrants in metropolitan Los Angeles counties with the largest groups of Chinese immigrants, this study uses a path analytic approach to trace how predictors are related to depressive symptoms and to measure direct and indirect influences of variables. Although bivariate analyses suggested that many predictors were associated with depressive symptoms, multivariate path analysis revealed a more complex structure of mediated associations. In the multivariate path analysis only reports of physical health and immigrant stress were directly related to depressive symptoms (P < 0.05), while acculturation, time in the US, income, US citizenship, and distance of persons on whom one could rely were related to stress (but not to physical health status) and only to depressive symptoms as mediated by stress. Age and educational attainment were related to health status (and to stress as mediated by physical health) and to depressive symptoms as mediated by both health and stress. These variables were also unrelated directly to health status and to depressive symptoms. Associations were evaluated using statistical significance, P < 0.05. This study demonstrates the significance of stress and health as mediators of variables in the larger context of the physical environment and suggests that the mechanisms linking ecological characteristics of immigrants to depressive symptoms may be stress and physical health among immigrants.

The primary objective of this study was to examine the relationships between place of birth, length of residency, discrimination and substance use among Southeast Asian and Latino immigrants. This study examined secondary data that originated from a population-based health survey and focused on respondents who took the survey in Hmong (N=158), Vietnamese (N=148), and Spanish (N=341). Results indicated that U.S.-born respondents were significantly associated with both higher alcohol and tobacco use than foreign-born respondents. Results also indicated that U.S.-born respondents perceived significantly higher discrimination than foreign-born respondents. Results indicated that while discrimination was associated with both higher alcohol and tobacco use for foreign-born Vietnamese and Latino men, discrimination was associated only with higher alcohol use for foreign-born Hmong men. For women, discrimination was associated with both higher alcohol and tobacco use only for foreign-born Latino women, but not for foreign-born Hmong and Vietnamese women. As expected, results indicated a positive relationship between length of residency in the U.S. and alcohol use for the entire sample except for foreign-born Hmong men. While Hmong, Vietnamese, and Latino immigrant men had a negative relationship between length of residency and tobacco use, the study found that Vietnamese and Latino immigrant women had a positive relationship between length of residency and tobacco use. The study also found that the relationship between length of residency in the U.S. and alcohol use is partially mediated by discrimination only for foreign-born Latino men and women. The present study found a positive association between chronic discrimination and engagement in heavy drinking for foreign-born Southeast Asian men and Latino men and women. Findings from this study may alert clinicians to be sensitive to discrimination experienced amongst Southeast Asian and Latino populations (even among the U.S.-born individuals) and to motivate them to identify potential stressors for U.S.-born Hmong, Vietnamese, and Latino individuals and the associated risk for psychological stressors. High prevalence of discrimination found in this sample of Southeast Asian and Latino immigrants may further strengthen the literature in demonstrating the significance of discrimination and shape mental health outreach services for underserved immigrant populations. The effectiveness of tobacco prevention strategies targeting Southeast Asian and Latino immigrants may increase when they take into consideration the findings of this study which suggest that heavier tobacco users may be less acculturated men and more acculturated women.

Immigrant groups include those from Latin America/Caribbean, East and South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe/Central Asia, and Middle East/North Africa. Multivariate logistic regressions are estimated using cross-sectional data from the New Immigrant Survey (N = 7,397). Results show that patterns of smoking and binge drinking vary by gender and by region of origins. In addition, arriving at age 0–9 are directly associated with higher odds of binge drinking among adult women. Among adult men, age at migration moderates the association between length of residence and substance use. Specifically, length of residence has more detrimental effects for adolescent immigrants (arriving at age 10–18) on smoking, while its detrimental effects are more pronounced for childhood immigrants (arriving at age 0–9) on binge drinking. We interpret our findings within the critical period model in epidemiological research, concluding that adolescence and childhood are critical life stages that are associated with differential effects of length of residence when looking at smoking and binge drinking among immigrant men.

The main objective is to evaluate the extent to which the relationship between black immigrants’ individual‐level socioeconomic status characteristics and suburban outcomes conforms to the tenets of the spatial assimilation model. Using micro‐data from the 2006–2010 American Community Survey, we employed logistic regression models to determine the effects of the relevant predictors on suburban residence of whites and black ethnic groups. The results reveal that black immigrants’ suburban outcomes vary depending upon the racial/ethnic background and nativity status of the reference group. While both black Caribbean and African immigrants are less likely to reside in the suburbs than native‐born white households, they are more likely to do so than native‐born black Americans, even when controlling for differences in income, education, and homeownership. We also find black immigrants’ probability of suburban residence varies by English language proficiency and length of time spent in the United States in ways that contradict the tenets of the spatial assimilation model.

In recent years, international humanitarian resettlement programs have increased the numbers of Africans entering third country resettlement programs; however, very little has been written about the experiences of African adults in resettlement as compared to other refugee groups. The current study used quantitative and qualitative methods to enhance understanding of the refugee experience among a specific group of refugees, adults from Sudan resettled in Brisbane, Australia. Ninety Sudanese adults (Mean age = 34.19) participated in the quantitative study, with 10 participants from that group purposefully selected to complete the semi-structured qualitative interview. Participants represented 20 different ethnic groups and reported disparate backgrounds and experiences both in Sudan and Australia, highlighting the incredibly heterogeneity of the Sudanese community. Quantitative participants reported an average 5.54 traumatic experiences on the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) and approximately one-quarter of the sample meeting recommended cut-off criteria for significant psychological distress on the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist (HSCL) and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on the HTQ. Individuals with higher rates of prior trauma, younger adults, and people who had spent time in a refugee camp reported higher levels of psychological distress. These groups also reported higher frequencies of discrimination, with one-third of the sample reporting experiences of discrimination several times per month. During data collection in 2007, there was significant public debate regarding the integration of the Sudanese community, mirroring debates worldwide as nations struggle with public discourse surrounding changes in global migration. In the current sample, the majority of participants (54.4%) reported integration as their method of acculturation, with individuals who had been in Australia longer, having higher levels of education and greater social connectivity within both the Sudanese and Australian communities being more likely to endorse integration. The ten qualitative participants emphasized opportunities for advancement such as through education and employment opportunities as a highlight and experiences of discrimination as a low point in resettlement, suggesting the importance of social context and opportunities for advancement in resettlement.

Very little research has been conducted on the connections between migration and suicidality among adolescents in Hong Kong, and so is the aim of this article. It uses census and registration data to study suicide mortality, and sample survey data collected for this purpose to investigate suicide attempt, suicide ideation, and self-injurious behavior. Relations between suicidality and socio-demographic/psychological factors replicated those found in the literature. Duration of residence was found important for the study of suicide among migrants. In both the bivariate and multivariate analyses, although the suicidality levels for short-duration (less than 10 years) adolescent migrants were very much lower than the local-born counterparts, those for the long-duration (10 years or more) migrants were very much higher. The findings support the Healthy Migrant Hypothesis and other related hypotheses in migrant mortality studies.

Suicide rates vary across ethnic groups. Whether suicide behavior differs by ethnic groups in the USA in the same way as observed for suicide death is a matter of current discussion. The aim of this report was to compare the lifetime prevalence of suicide ideation and attempt among four main ethnic groups (Asians, Blacks, Hispanics, and Whites) in the USA. Method: Suicide ideation and attempts were assessed using the World Mental Health version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI). Discrete time survival analysis was used to examine risk for lifetime suicidality by ethnicity and immigration among 15 180 participants in the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiological Surveys (CPES), a group of cross-sectional surveys. Results: Suicide ideation was most common among Non-Hispanic Whites (16.10 %), least common among Asians (9.02%) and intermediate among Hispanics (11.35%) and Non-Hispanic Blacks (11.82 %). Suicide attempts were equally common among Non-Hispanic Whites (4.69 %), Hispanics (5.11%) and Non-Hispanic Blacks (4.15%) and less common among Asians (2.55 %). These differences in the crude prevalence rates of suicide ideation decreased but persisted after control for psychiatric disorders, but disappeared for suicide attempt. Within ethnic groups, risk for suicidality was low among immigrants prior to migration compared to the US born, but equalized over time after migration. Conclusions: Ethnic differences in suicidal behaviors are explained partly by differences in psychiatric disorders and low risk prior to arrival in the USA. These differences are likely to decrease as the US-born proportion of Hispanics and Asians increases.

In brief, the cultural variety within Muslim American communities as well as within an envisioned 'mainstream America' forces us to reckon with acculturation as a kaleidoscope of individual practices and meanings. I draw on analyses of original questionnaire data collected from 246 Bridgeview Muslim youths and adults (as part of the Islamic Adaptations Project, led by Professor Richard A. Shweder, and generously supported by the Russell Sage Foundation), and extensive fieldwork in the Bridgeview Muslim community. Substantive chapters highlight intra-communal diversity with respect to respondents' demographic characteristics (Chapter 3), their beliefs and practices pertaining to Islamic clothing (Chapter 4), their subjective identifications of popular American values (Chapter 5), their reported compatibility with those values (Chapter 6), and other aspects of everyday life.

Using large-scale Spanish register data consisting of information on 5.4 million international migration events on a monthly basis and 13.9 million intermunicipal migration events, of which 3.8 million events concern the foreign-born population’s internal migration within Spain, the analyses show that ethnic segregation increased (i.e., the average geographical distance) between Arab immigrants and native Spaniards shortly after the terror bombing, but that no such effect was found for other immigrant groups. The analysis also shows that this was a relative short-term effect: After about 1 or 2 years, ethnic segregation started to decline again (and thus resumed the declining trend that was observed during the years before the terrorist bombing). We interpret these results in terms of belief formation mechanisms. Because of priming and framing effects, the terrorist bombings accentuated the salience of ethnic categorizations and induced threat-attributing ethnic stereotypes, which were influencing migration behaviors. However, not only did native Spaniards become more reluctant to live in close proximity to Arab immigrants, Arab migrants also became more inclined to move closer to coethnics, possibly because of a perceived threat to become victims of discriminatory behaviors of the majority population. Priming and framing affects abated after a while, and migration behaviors started to return to normal again. Finally, we discuss a variety of survey data to substantiate the argument that belief formation mechanisms played an important role in these processes.

Although the influence of cultural processes as the cause of low service use is widely speculated, no empirical study has tested cultural determinants (including culturally specific idioms of distress, culture-based illness interpretations, or concerns about social consequences), social contextual factors, perceived need (PN), and help-seeking (HS) behaviors. In the present study, we examined how cultural determinants, such as symptom experience, beliefs and interpretations, and perceptions about the social environment, affect PN and HS type for Japanese women living in the United States. Increasing physical symptom severity increased the predicted probability of endorsing PN. For those participants with PN, 48.6% of them used medical HS (χ2 = 11.27, p = .00), and 12.5% of them used the psychological HS (χ2 = 7.43, p = .01). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that, when PN is considered with the other cultural variables while controlling for structural variables, PN increases the odds of medical HS (OR = 2.78, 95% CI [1.0–5.8], p < .01). The odds of medical HS are also increased with higher social support (OR = 1.07, 95% CI [1.0–1.1], p < .01). Finally, the presence of interpersonal stigma beliefs decreased the odds of medical HS (OR = 2.4, 95% CI [1.1–5.3], p < .03). Clinical and research implications are discussed.

Moroccan, Pakistani, Ecuadorian, and Romanian immigrants residing in Barcelona nominated 25 individuals (i.e., alters) from their habitual social networks and provided demographic (e.g., ethnicity), relationship type (e.g., family, friend, neighbor), and structural (who knew whom) information for each of these alters. Even after controlling for individual-level demographic and acculturation variables, the content and structure of immigrants’ personal social networks had unique associations with both types of adjustment and with BII. Specifically, the overall degree of cultural diversity in the network and the amount of Catalan (but not Spanish) 'weak' ties (i.e., acquaintances, colleagues, neighbors) positively predicted these outcomes. Amount of interconnectedness between local coethnic and Catalan/Spanish alters also predicted sociocultural adjustment and BII positively. Finally, against a 'culture and language similarity' hypothesis, Moroccan and Pakistani participants had social networks that were more culturally integrated, relative to Ecuadorians and Romanians. Results from this study attest to the importance of examining actual intercultural relations and going beyond individuals’ reported acculturation preferences to understand immigrants’ overall adaptation and cultural identity dynamics. Furthermore, results highlight the interplay between interculturalism experienced at the intrapersonal, subjective level (i.e., BII), and at the meso-level (i.e., having culturally diverse networks that also include interethnic ties among alters).

This study examined the association between perceived discrimination, acculturation, immigration stress and blood pressure. Methods. The participants included 76 Russian and Ukrainian immigrant men and women, aged 18–65 who immigrated to the United States at or after the age of 16 years (M age = 40.97 SD = 10.94). Perceived discrimination, immigration stress, and acculturation were measured with self-report instruments, and the blood pressure was measured with a sphygmomanometer. The research design was correlational. To determine which of the study variables would likely best predict systolic and diastolic blood pressure, exploratory Pearson product-moment correlations were computed in which the chosen predictor variables were correlated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure reported by the participants and other potential predictor variables. Multiple regression analyses were then used to determine which study variable best predicts blood pressure. Predictor variables were discrimination, acculturation, and immigration stress. Criterion variable was blood pressure. Results. Multiple Regression analyses revealed that perceived discrimination was the best predictor of systolic blood pressure, with immigration stress as the second best predictor. Discrimination and immigration stress level were shown to equally predict diastolic blood pressure. Specifically, higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure was associated with higher levels of discrimination and immigration stress. Acculturation was found to be unrelated to systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Conclusion. This study highlights the importance of examining and fills in a critical gap in knowledge concerning the effects of discrimination and immigration stress on blood pressure and health in general in Russian- and Ukranian-speaking immigrants and other ethnic minorities.

Yet little attention has been paid thus far to the role of acculturation in the context of forced migration. In this study we examined the association between acculturation patterns and mental health symptoms among a convenience sample of Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers (n = 118) who accessed health services at the Physicians for Human Rights Open-Clinic in Israel. Participants completed measures on sociodemographic information as well as detention history, mental health symptoms, exposure to traumatic events, and acculturation pattern, in their native language upon accessing services. Consistent with our predictions, findings showed that acculturation predicted depressive symptoms among asylum seekers beyond the effect of history of detention and reports of experiences of traumatic events. Assimilated compared with integrated asylum seekers reported higher depressive symptoms. Findings draw attention to the paradox of assimilation, and the mental health risks it poses among those wishing to integrate into the new culture at the expanse of their original culture. Asylum seekers may be particularly vulnerable to the risks of assimilation in the restrictive policies that characterize many industrial countries in recent years.

Linguistic and temporal proxy measures for acculturation were independent variables along with ethnicity, plus controls for gender, age, education, and income in multivariate analyses. About one-fifth of contrasts between non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, English-interviewed Hispanics, and Spanish-interviewed Hispanics were statistically significant (Bonferroni-corrected) and of medium or higher affect size, with most featuring the Spanish-interviewed Hispanics. Knowledge variables featured the most significant differences. Specifically, Spanish-interviewed Hispanics reported less concern, familiarity with pollution, recognition of high pollution, and vigorous outdoor activity, and greater belief that government overregulates pollution than English-interviewed Hispanics (and than the other two groups on most of these variables too). English-interviewed Hispanics did not differ from non-Hispanic whites, but did on several variables from non-Hispanic blacks. Temporal proxies of acculturation among the foreign-born were far less significant, but concern and familiarity with air pollution increased with time spent in the United States, while belief in overregulation and a positive trend in New Jersey pollution increased with time in the nation of origin.

Results: High self-identified religiosity was significantly associated with higher BMI after adjusting for socio-demographic and acculturation measures. Highly religious Asian Indians had 1.53 greater odds (95% CI: 1.18, 2.00) of being overweight or obese than low religiosity immigrants, though this varied by religious affiliation.

Despite previous research supporting the advantages of developing a bicultural style to acculturation, mixed results have been found regarding native and host country acculturation patterns among resettled refugees and how these patterns may be associated with refugee mental health outcomes. Methods: The objective of this study was not only to consider the roles that US and native acculturation may play on the self-report of identity distress and internalizing symptoms among refugee adolescents more broadly, but also to consider the role various dimensions of acculturation (e.g., cultural identity, language competence, and cultural competence) may play for refugee adolescents post-resettlement. Results and Conclusions: The study findings indicate that native acculturation, and more specifically native cultural identity, may serve as significant protective factors against identity distress among adolescent refugees post-resettlement, with native cultural identity additionally serving as a protective factor against internalizing symptoms. US acculturation was not found to be significantly associated with identity distress or internalizing symptoms, nor were the acculturative dimensions of language learning (i.e., English and native language competencies), cultural knowledge (i.e., US and native cultural knowledge competencies), or US cultural identity.

To achieve this goal, measures of acculturation, income, and education were stochastically incorporated into the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (PARS). Using the 1990 California Tobacco Survey and U.S. Census data, we estimated the combination of zip-code-based measures that most accurately predicts an individual, language-based acculturation index for Hispanics and Asians. Logistic regression was used to investigate the role of these variables in safety belt nonuse in fatal MVCs. We found that acculturation has a positive direct effect on safety belt use among Hispanics. We hypothesize that this positive direct effect is caused by Hispanic immigrants learning the benefits of wearing safety belts. However, our study also suggests an indirect negative effect of acculturation on safety belt use through drinking and driving. Prevention programs aimed at increasing the safety of Hispanic drivers not only need to take acculturation differences into account, but also need to be comprehensive in their message, simultaneously targeting both seat belt nonuse and drinking-and-driving problems.

Health outcomes among immigrants from the former Soviet Union in the United States.",1,NA,"Immigrants in the U.S. often experience better health than the native-born, and many explanations for this phenomenon center around the positive health behaviors that immigrants bring from their home cultures. Immigrants from the former Soviet Union may be an exception; because they come from societies where unhealthy lifestyles and high mortality are common, they are often expected to experience worse health than the native population. Using data from the Integrated Health Interview Series, I compare FSU immigrants with U.S.-born, non-Hispanic whites on several health measures. FSU immigrants are twice as likely as native whites to report fair or poor health, but they are less likely to smoke or drink, and are less likely to report a functional limitation. FSU immigrants’ advantage in functional limitation is largely explained by their very high levels of education and marriage, indicating that selectivity is important to understanding the health of this population.

The objectives of this dissertation are threefold: First, to develop an expanded and integrated explanatory model of Latino acculturative stress that accounts for culture, stress and coping, cognitive appraisal, timing, and family and neighborhood factors; second, to evaluate the reliability and validity evidence of the English language version of the CESD-R; and third, to evaluate the reliability and validity evidence of the Spanish language version of the CESD-R. The first manuscript posits an explanatory model that expands upon and integrates work by Berry (2006) and most notably adds the dimension of family and neighborhood. Recent research findings on Latino immigrant depression point toward the importance of understanding and leveraging the protective nature of neighborhood and family (Breslau, 2011; Shell, Peek, & Eschbach, 2013). The second manuscript evaluates the validity and reliability evidence of the English language version of the CESD-R. The results of an EFA, CFAs, and a multiple-group CFA of the English version of the CESD-R suggest that a 15-item version of the CESD-R best fit the study data. The final two-factor solution of negative mood and functional impairment and suicide, fit the data well. The third manuscript evaluates the reliability and validity evidence of the Spanish language version of the CESD-R. The scores of the Spanish Language version of the CESD-R fit the same CESD-R factor structure of Manuscript II. The results support the use of the 15-item version of the CESD-R with a Spanish speaking sample. This suggests that despite cultural differences, there are common cross-cultural components of depression that relate to negative mood and functional impairment and suicide.

Predictor variables included Mexican American ethnicity and a validated Acculturation Index comprised of language spoken at home, interview language, and proportion of life residing in the U.S. The mediator variables were depressive symptoms and log10 transformed C-reactive protein. Compared to U.S.-born, non-Hispanic whites, Mexican American immigrants reported poorer SRH. Mexican American immigrant status was also indirectly associated with worse SRH via greater C- reactive protein. Among Mexican American immigrants, greater acculturation was associated with better SRH. Poorer SRH among Mexican American immigrants may be partially attributable to greater inflammation.

It was hypothesized that culture moderates the social gradient, with the relationship between SES and BP differing as a function of culture. To investigate the idea of a 'cultural gradient' a sample of Hispanic immigrants and Whites was studied. A total of 79 participants (30 Hispanic immigrant, 49 White) wore ambulatory blood pressure monitors for 24 h. The Hispanic immigrants also completed the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans-II . Hispanic immigrants had lower SES and lower BP compared to Whites. A cultural gradient moderating the social gradient was evident with Hispanic immigrants displaying a positive relationship between SES and BP and Whites displaying a negative relationship. Among Hispanic immigrants, increased acculturation to Western culture decreased the positive relationship between SES and BP. Just as there is a social gradient with increasing socioeconomic status related to better cardiovascular health, there appears to be a cultural gradient with increasing acculturation to Western society related to worse cardiovascular health.

This study aims to identify differences among five ethnic subgroups (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Filipino, and Vietnamese) of older Asian immigrants in California and to examine predictors of mental health service utilization within each ethnic subgroup. The Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations (BMVP) was used to guide the secondary data analysis of a sample of 3,453 older Asian immigrants from the 2009, 2011-2012, and 2013 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS). ANOVA and chi square tests were used to examine group differences and logistic and linear regression analyses were performed to examine predictors of mental health service use and the frequency of mental health service use, respectively. The older Asian immigrant samples were not homogeneous. The Japanese and Filipino samples had better socioeconomic status and higher level of acculturation than others. The Korean sample had the lowest level of mental distress and least use of mental health services. Help-seeking patterns regarding mental health care differed across subgroups. Decreasing age (Chinese and Japanese), female (Vietnamese), not being married (Korean), lower education (Japanese), decreasing perceived safety (Vietnamese), higher levels of mental distress (all), and having perceived need (all) were associated with an increasing likelihood of using mental health services. Not being married (Korean), higher levels of acculturation (Filipino), lower levels of neighborhood cohesion (Korean and Vietnamese), higher levels of perceived safety (Korean) and lower levels of perceived safety (Vietnamese), higher levels of mental distress (Korean and Filipino), and having perceived need (all) were related to more visits for mental health services. Mental health seeking patterns differed by ethnicity within the older Asian immigrant sample. Findings highlight the necessity of cultural competency services and programs for each Asian ethnicity.

Despite the profound consequences of externalizing problems for children, their families, and their communities, we know less about the precise trajectory of externalizing symptoms across late childhood and adolescence, because of the paucity of fine-grained longitudinal research. The present study examined the development of externalizing symptoms in a large sample (N = 674) of Mexican-origin youth, assessed annually from age 10 to 17. Specifically, we conducted analyses to better understand the trajectories of attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and conduct disorder (CD) symptoms (and their codevelopment), as well as how gender and cultural factors influence symptom trajectories. On average, ADHD symptoms slowly declined from age 10 to 17; ODD symptoms increased until age 13 and then declined thereafter; and, CD symptoms slowly increased until age 15 and then leveled off. ADHD, ODD, and CD symptoms predicted change in each other, indicating youth may accumulate multiple forms of externalizing problems over time. Boys reported fewer externalizing problems than girls, contrary to expectations. Consistent with the Immigrant Paradox, we found that 2nd + generation youth, youth who endorsed fewer traditional Mexican cultural values (traditional gender roles, traditional family values, and religiosity), and youth who engaged in less Spanish/more English language use were at increased risk for exhibiting ADHD, ODD, and CD symptoms from childhood through adolescence. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these developmental patterns among Mexican-origin youth.

Data come from the ITAGEN2 survey (2005–2006). First, the authors analyze the relationship of short-run expectations and long-term aspirations to structural (e.g., migration status and country of origin) and social (e.g., family socioeconomic status and friendship ties) conditions. The latter seem to be determinants of both expectations and aspirations, but long-term educational aspirations are not associated with migration status. Second, the authors investigate the relevance of context in delineating educational attitudes. The authors performed a multilevel analysis including both individual-and school-level variables. Their results show that attending a school where most of the Italian pupils have high educational expectations may lead children of immigrants to enhance their own aspirations.

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of age and spiritual well-being to acculturation and general health outcomes. The study employed a cross-sectional design and a convenience sampling method. Data was collected from 62 Romanian immigrant adults in the greater Sacramento, California region. The instruments used to collect data were a demographic form, the Spiritual Well-Being Scale, the Stephenson Multigroup Acculturation Scale, and the General Health Questionnaire. All instruments were translated into Romanian, the native language of the participants, by the researcher who is fluent in both English and Romanian. Five hypotheses were developed: (a) Participants who immigrated at a younger age will have higher levels of acculturation, (b) Participants who immigrated at a younger age will report better general health outcomes, (c) Participants with higher levels of spiritual well-being will report better physical and psychological health, (d) Participants who will report higher levels of spiritual will also report higher levels of acculturation, and (e) Orthodox participants will present with lower levels of acculturation. Since all of the variables included in each analysis were categorical, chi-square analyses were conducted to test the research hypothesis. The results of this dissertation supported two of the hypothesis: age at immigration seems to affect the level of acculturation and spiritual well-being seems to affect physical health. The finding which did not support the hypothesis showed that there is no significant relationship between age at immigration and the level of physical and psychological health; spiritual well-being and the level of acculturation, and psychological health; and religious affiliation and the level of acculturation. This study provides additional information that may help explain Romanian immigrants' acculturation experience, spiritual well-being and general health outcomes.

Research indicates that immigration-related factors such as acculturation (Berry, 1980; Suinn, 2010) and transnational ties (Murphy & Mahalingam, 2004) are important in understanding elevated depressive symptoms in Vietnamese immigrants (Leung, Cheung, & Cheung, 2010) and other immigrant populations. Empirical research, however, has yet to examine acculturation, transnational ties, and depressive symptoms concomitantly. To fill this gap, the current study employed both a mediation and a moderation framework to separately examine whether transnational ties mediated or moderated the relationships between dimensions of acculturation and depressive symptoms. The sample comprised of pilot study (N = 37) and dissertation study (N = 107) participants who were recruited through convenience and snowball sampling in the Southwest and Midwest regions of the United States. Participants completed surveys comprised of demographic information, the Asian American Multidimensional Acculturation Scale (AAMAS; Chung, Kim, & Abreu, 2004), the Transnationalism Scale (TS; Murphy & Mahalingam, 2004), and the Center for Epidemiological Study of Depression scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977). No mediation effects were found for transnational ties as a mediator between the associations of acculturation dimensions with depressive symptoms. Significant moderation effects were found for the Financial and Commercial Ties aspect of transnational ties in moderating the relationship between acculturation to the Vietnamese culture and depressive symptoms. As acculturation to the Vietnamese culture increased, levels of depressive symptoms decreased, and the decrease in depressive symptoms was more pronounced for Vietnamese immigrants who reported higher levels of Financial and Commercial Ties compared to those who reported lower levels. When acculturation to the Vietnamese culture was high, participants with high Financial and Commercial Ties had lower depressive symptoms than those with the same level of acculturation but engaged in low Financial and Commercial Ties. However, for participants with low identification with the Vietnamese culture but engaged in high Financial and Commercial Ties, their depressive symptoms were higher than those with the same low identification with the Vietnamese culture but engaged in low Financial and Commercial Ties.

However, little is known about culturally-relevant, multilevel predictors of low SSS among low socioeconomic status (SES), minority populations. The goal of this study was to identify individual- and neighborhood-level variables predicting SSS among 297 Spanish-speaking Latino immigrant smokers living in several locations in Texas, with an emphasis on the association of SSS with acculturative and socioeconomic variables. Participants were recruited and enrolled through the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service from August 2002 to March 2004. Determinants of SSS were explored using a series of linear regressions. In analyses adjusting for demographics (including objective indicators of SES), speaking Spanish at home and work and living in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, respectively, were associated with low SSS. However, in analyses including demographics, acculturation, and neighborhood characteristics, only income, education, and acculturation remained associated with SSS. Consistent with results from a previous study in the area (Franzini & Fernandez-Esquer, 2006), less acculturation predicted low SSS among immigrant Latino smokers. However, unlike previous research, these associations were maintained after controlling for SES. Results suggest that the density of less acculturated Latinos within economically deprived neighborhoods might account for the disappearance of neighborhood effects in the final model.

It is hypothesized that this emotional distress that arises from acculturation is responsible for much of the negative effects of acculturation on the physical and emotional well-being of acculturating individuals, termed acculturative distress. The current study investigates the effects of acculturative distress on ambulatory blood pressure, depression, and anxiety. Eighty Greek immigrant adolescents ranging in age from 14 to 18 years (mean=15.4 years; 60% female, 17.5% 1st generation, 60% 2 nd generation, and 12.5% 3rd generation immigrants) were recruited from a Greek American high school in Astoria, NY. Participants were asked to complete a series of questionnaires, which assessed acculturation, acculturative distress, depression, anxiety, socioeconomic status, and social support. On a separate day, ambulatory blood pressure was assessed during the school day. Boys were found to have significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) at baseline and during the ambulatory phase, higher body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio; the girls' scores were higher for depression, anxiety, tangible support, and appraisal support. Acculturative distress was predictive of depression and anxiety levels, and it was found to be mediated by tangible support. First generation immigrant adolescents had higher systolic BP for the duration of the study than 2nd generation immigrant adolescents, and 1st and 2nd generation immigrant adolescents had higher heart rate under distress than 3rd generation immigrant adolescents. Personal acculturative distress was predictive of ambulatory heart rate under distress before controlling for age, sex, waist-hip ratio, BMI, and activity. In the current study, acculturative distress did not have an effect on ambulatory BP of Greek immigrant adolescents. It has been shown, however, that acculturative distress has a strong impact on the psychological well-being of the participants through increased symptoms of depression and anxiety. These findings were found to be mediated by the perceived tangible support. Boys were also found to have higher systolic and diastolic BP than girls, while girls reported higher levels of psychological distress than boys.

Female learners consistently outperformed male learners in speaking and writing proficiency in Dutch as a second language. This gender gap remained remarkably robust and constant when other learner characteristics were taken into account, such as education, age of arrival, length of residence and hours studying Dutch. For reading and listening skills in Dutch, no gender gap was found. In addition, we found a general gender by education effect for all four language skills in Dutch for speaking, writing, reading, and listening. Female language learners turned out to profit more from higher educational training than male learners do in adult second language acquisition. These findings do not seem to match nurture-oriented explanatory frameworks based for instance on a human capital approach or gender-specific acculturation processes. Rather, they seem to corroborate a nature-based, gene-environment correlational framework in which language proficiency being a genetically-influenced ability interacting with environmental factors such as motivation, orientation, education, and learner strategies that still mediate between endowment and acquiring language proficiency at an adult stage.

Demographics, health belief model (HBM) constructs, and acculturation were examined as predictors of sexual behaviors over the last year. Analyses indicated that participants who reported a higher number of sexual partners and more frequent sexual intercourse tended to be more educated and more likely to be nonheterosexual. The HBM constructs, as a set, reliably predicted participants' sexual behaviors. Self-efficacy was the strongest predictor within the HBM. Furthermore, acculturation moderated the predictive power of the HBM with respect to intercourse frequency. The main limitation of the study is that the measure of HBM, which was not designed to target Asian immigrants, was psychometrically poor. The results suggest self-efficacy is a target for behavioral change, acculturation may need to be incorporated into the HBM, and more culturally sensitive measures need to be developed.

Despite consistent evidence of the association between immigration status and physical activity, the effects of acculturation on active commuting has been understudied. This study examines two hypotheses: foreign-born individuals have increased odds of active commuting compared to Canadian-born individuals—a ‘healthy immigrant effect’; and among the foreign-born, there is an inverse association between time since immigration and time spent active commuting—loss of this effect over time. Data was compiled from more than 59,000 individuals from the 2013–2014 cycle of the Canadian Community Health Survey and probability weighted to account for the survey sampling method. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine relationships. Four active commuting categories were examined, from none to commuting times sufficient to meet Canadian physical activity guidelines (≥ 150 minutes per week). After adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, and personal income, the odds of active commuting versus none were higher for foreign-born individuals compared to Canadian-born individuals for 75 to < 150 minutes per week (OR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.15, 1.73) and ≥ 150 minutes per week (OR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.06, 1.73). Within the immigrant cohort, the odds of meeting Canadian guidelines were greater for recent immigrants than late immigrants (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.29, 2.46). These findings show for the first time that recent immigrants have higher levels of active commuting compared with late immigrants in a dose-response pattern. They suggest that there could be missed opportunities to retain active commuters after immigrants arrive in Canada. This is especially important for policymakers as the proportion of foreign-born persons is expected to increase from 25 to 28% of the Canadian population by 2031.

The, still scanty, literature shows high prevalence rates of psychopathology among asylum seekers, but there has been little interest for other impaired dimensions of health. The present study is part of a community-based mental health survey among Iraqi asylum seekers in the Netherlands, conducted between November 2000 and September 2001, on the risks of a long asylum procedure. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to explore quality of life (QoL), disability and physical health and their relationships with psychopathology and pre- and post-migration variables. Method: Two groups of pre-stratified (length of asylum procedure), randomly selected Iraqi asylum seekers (N = 143 and N = 151), were interviewed with fully structured, culturally validated questionnaires. Quality of life was examined with QoL WHO-Bref, functional disability with the Brief Disability Questionnaire and physical health with a newly developed questionnaire. Psychiatric (DSM IV) disorders were measured with the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview 2.1. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the relationships between the outcome measures and socio-demographics, adverse life events in Iraq, post-migration living problems (PMLP) and psychopathology. Results: Respondents with a long asylum procedure reported significantly lower QoL, higher functional disability and more physical complaints. Multivariate regression shows that length of stay is the strongest predictor for a low overall QoL. In addition, lower QoL was predicted by psychopathology, higher age, adverse life events in the Netherlands and the PMLP-clusters: family issues, socio-economic living conditions and socio-religious aspects. Disability was predicted by psychopathology, higher age and the PMLP clusters: family issues and socio-religious aspects. Physical complaints were predicted by length of asylum procedure, psychopathology, female sex, adverse life events in Iraq and PMLP-family issues. Conclusion: A long asylum procedure has a negative impact on the overall health situation and the QoL of asylum seekers. The situation is not only harming the affected, but also interferes with the integration process in the Netherlands or elsewhere. The findings are important for health professionals, governments and human right specialists.

Multivariate Analysis of Variance procedure revealed no significant difference in performance between the two groups on the select scales of the MCMI-III (p =.883). Additional analyses revealed significant difference between the two groups on the Compulsive scale: Caribbean Blacks obtained a higher mean (Cohen’s d =.-50. F = 6.663, p = .011). Analyses comparing the Blacks in the current sample to the MCMI-III’s development sample indicated the following: (a) a significant difference between the two groups on the Antisocial, Narcissistic, and Delusional Disorder Scales and (b) no significant difference between the two groups on the Paranoid scale (p = .559). Supplemental analysis revealed moderate association between the Paranoid and Delusional Disorder Scales of the MCMI-III and certain scales of the AAAS-R, implying both a degree of item overlap and similar item content.

Nine hours of DSME classes were offered to clients at Daylight Adult Health Day Care Centers in Glendale and Los Angeles over a 6-week period. The attendees of these 2 centers are mostly first generation immigrants of Armenian descent who are age 65 years and older. The classes were offered in Armenian language by a certified diabetes educator of Armenian descent. The impact of DSME on HbA1c (A1c) levels and perception of empowerment in ethnic Armenians was studied. The impact of acculturation, age, gender, and number of years of diabetes was explored. The sample was homogeneous with respect to ethnicity, age group, and health insurance. The subjects were obtained by convenience sampling. The researcher performed a quasi experimental before and after one group design to assess the impact of education on A1c levels and 8-item Diabetes Empowerment Scale (DES) scores. A paired t-test was used to compare the difference in A1c and DES scores. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the mediating effect of acculturation on both A1c and DES. Seventy-five participants completed the study. The results of the paired sample t-test indicated that the mean of the post-A1c (M = 6.86, SD = 1.03) was significantly lower than the pre-A1c levels (M = 7.19, SD = 1.25, t(74) = 2.415, p < .05. The mean of the post-DES (M = 4.36, SD = 0.52) was significantly greater than the mean of pre-DES (M = 4.05, SD = 0.55), t(74) = -4.225, p < .05.

Methods: Israeli women aged 45–64 were randomly selected according to age and population strata of three groups: long-term Jewish residents (LTR), Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union, and Arab women (mostly Israeli-born). Interviews were conducted with 540 LTR, 151 immigrants, and 123 Arab women. The survey instrument included the occurrence and rating of how bothersome to everyday function were 16 symptoms. Three outcome variables included hot flashes and two scales for mental and somatic symptoms extracted from exploratory factor analysis. Results: Multivariate logistic regressions showed that immigrants and Arab women (compared to LTR) had a significantly lower risk of reporting hot flashes and mental and somatic symptoms. Menopausal status was related only to hot flashes. Low education and depression were associated with the three symptom scales, whereas nonhealthy lifestyle was related only to somatic symptoms. Conclusions: Our main finding is that cultural group is an independent predictor of each of the three menopausal symptom scales. A possible explanation for the lower reporting of symptoms among Arab and immigrant groups is that they differ from the LTR in level of acculturation and attitudes toward menopause. These findings support the proposition of a cultural factor in menopausal symptomatology that needs to be addressed by clinicians caring for women at midlife.

However, most studies on immigration and breastfeeding practices have been in Western countries. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of length of time since immigration on the breastfeeding practices of Mainland Chinese immigrants living in Hong Kong. Methods: We recruited 2704 mother-infant pairs from the postnatal wards of four public hospitals in Hong Kong. We examined the effect of migration status on the duration of any and exclusive breastfeeding. Results: Breastfeeding duration was progressively shorter as the time since immigration increased. When compared with mothers who had lived in Hong Kong for < 5 years, Hong Kong-born participants had a 30% higher risk of stopping any breastfeeding (hazard ratio [HR] 1.34 [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.10-1.63]) and exclusive breastfeeding (HR 1.33 [95% CI 1.11-1.58]). In both Hong Kong-born and immigrant participants, breastfeeding cessation was associated with return to work postpartum and the husband’s preference for infant formula or mixed feeding. Intention to exclusively breastfeed and to breastfeed for > 6 months, and previous breastfeeding experience substantially reduced the risk of breastfeeding cessation for both Hong Kong-born and immigrant participants. Conclusions: Health care professionals should consider immigration history in their assessment of pregnant women and provide culturally adapted breastfeeding support and encouragement to this population.

In Study 1, students completed a survey that indicated that their tolerance of Muslim practice was largely explained by their general attitudes to multiculturalism. However, among those who were highly reliant on the media, symbolic threat from Muslims played an additional role, with those who perceived more threat being less tolerant. Study 2 further explored these findings in a second survey that included other measures of threat that comprise the integrated threat theory. While intergroup anxiety was the form of threat with the strongest main effect on tolerance, the impact of symbolic threat was again moderated by reliance on the mass media.

Phase I tested the psychometric properties of a Spanish version of the Bell Object Relations and Reality Testing Inventory (BORRTI-SV), translated for use in this study. Male and female participants (N = 139) were recruited via email and data were collected online. The results of exploratory factor analysis yielded a four-factor structure, with two factors demonstrating good internal consistency: Egocentrico--Dependiente (Egocentric--Dependent) and the Desconfianza (Mistrust) scale. Phase II of the study hypothesized that (a) immature object relations would predict lower levels of subjective well-being, (b), higher acculturative stress would negatively impact subjective well-being, and (c) high biculturalism and socioeconomic status would contribute to better subjective well-being. Both male and female participants ( N = 75) were recruited at three community-based social service programs. The results of hierarchical regression analyses suggested that individuals who experienced high levels of acculturative stress, were also less satisfied with their lives. This type of stress appeared to override other factors frequently associated with subjective well-being in this sample. Study results, limitations, and future directions are discussed.

Among all newlyweds in the United States (U.S.) in 2010, 26% of Hispanics married out (Wang, 2012). Existing literature on society's attitudes towards assimilation and interracial marriage have changed since Latinos began immigrating to the U.S., resulting in positive changes in attitudes and an increase in interracial marriages (George & Yancey, 2003; Lee & Edmonston, 2005; Lee, 2008). There is a small amount of research that specifically focuses on attitudes toward interracial marriage among Latinos, and how acculturation may influence attitudes. The limited amount of research involving the Latino population does not specify the subgroups, or mostly focus on Mexican Americans, which is why this study examined attitudes among South Americans, the new wave of immigrants who have been understudied. The present study focused on providing an understanding on the influence of acculturation on attitudes toward interracial marriage among individuals who identified as Colombian, Ecuadorian, and Peruvian, due to having the highest rate of immigration to the United States (U.S. Census, 2010) among South American countries. Educational level, age, and generational status were also examined to determine their effects on attitudes. The final sample included 130 participants who voluntarily responded to anonymous online questionnaires. All participants completed a Demographic Questionnaire, the Short Acculturation Scale for Hispanics (SASH), and the Attitudes toward Interracial Dating Scale (ATIDS), and three-open ended narrative questions. Quantitative Results from this study showed that there was a significant interaction between generational status and attitudes toward interracial marriage. Education level and age were not correlated with attitudes toward interracial marriage, and the SASH and ATIDS were weakly correlated. Qualitative results displayed that majority of participants held positive attitudes toward interracial marriage. Participant responses revealed overarching themes of: love; values and beliefs; family; personal experience; exposure; and culture and identity, as contributors to attitudes toward interracial marriage. The overall results in this study, displayed support of interracial marriage among the South American population, specifically from Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.

Meanwhile, little is known regarding potential within-group acculturation and psychological differences underlying perceived barriers to genetic testing among women of African descent. Methods: Hypothesized contributions of acculturation factors and breast cancer-specific distress to perceived barriers to genetic testing were examined with a statistical analysis of baseline data from 146 women of African descent (56% US born and 44% foreign born) meeting genetic breast cancer risk criteria and participating in a larger longitudinal study that included the opportunity for free genetic counseling and testing. Perceived barriers assessed included: (1) anticipation of negative emotional reactions, (2) stigma, (3) confidentiality concerns, (4) family-related worry, and (5) family-related guilt associated with genetic testing. Results: In multivariate analyses, being foreign born was a significant predictor of anticipated negative emotional reactions about genetic testing (β = 0.26; SE = 0.11; p = 0.01). Breast cancer-specific distress scores (avoidance symptoms) were positively related to anticipated negative emotional reactions (β = 0.02; SE = 0.005; p = <0.0001), confidentiality concerns (β = 0.02; SE = 0.01; p = 0.02), and family-related guilt (β = 0.02; SE = 0.01; p = 0.0009) associated with genetic testing. Conclusions: Results suggest an influence of acculturation and breast cancer-specific distress on perceived barriers to genetic testing among women of African descent. The potential utility of culturally tailored genetic counseling services taking into account such influences and addressing emotional and psychological concerns of women considering genetic testing for breast cancer should be investigated.

By 2005, about 120 million Chinese rural villagers had migrated to work and reside in cities. Huge migration waves like these have triggered many social problems. Researchers from different disciplines of social sciences have therefore started to investigate the migrant issue. In this chapter, we focus on urban residents, and take a personality-psychological perspective to examine the impact of individual adult attachment styles on their attitudes toward the adaptation strategies adopted by the migrants. A sample of 457 Chinese urban residents from four cities was recruited for this study. Four types of adult attachment styles (preoccupied, fearful, secure, and dismissing) were measured by an Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ) (Hofstra etal., 2005). We described the acculturation strategies (integration, assimilation, separation, and marginalization) by using vignettes. The results show that a secure style stimulates a positive attitude toward the integration strategy; a preoccupied style tends to have a positive impact on the attitude toward the assimilation strategy; a dismissing or a fearful style significantly predicts the attitude toward the separation strategy; and a dismissing style is a good predictor for the attitude toward the marginalization strategy. Those findings to a large extent confirm our hypotheses and are consistent with previous findings. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are further discussed.

A growing body of research has investigated various health aspects among immigrant groups and found that some immigrant groups have poorer health than the majority population. It has been suggested that poor acculturation in the host country could lie behind the increased risk of worsened health among certain immigrant groups. The aim was to investigate the cross-sectional association between acculturation, measured as age at migration or length of residence, and self-rated health among young immigrants. Design: The simple, random samples of 7137 women and 7415 men aged 16-34 years were based on pooled, independent data collected during the period 1992-1999 obtained from the Swedish Annual Level of Living Survey (SALLS). Logistic regression was applied in the estimation of odds ratios (OR) for poor self-rated health, after accounting for age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES) and social networks. The non-response rate varied between 23.6 and 28.3% in the different immigrant groups. Results: The odds of poor self-rated health increased with increasing age at migration to Sweden among first-generation immigrants. For those who had resided in Sweden less than 15 years the odds of poor self-rated health were significantly increased. In addition, most of the immigrant groups had higher odds of poor self-rated health than the reference group. Conclusions: Health care workers and policy makers need to be aware that immigrants who arrive in the host country at higher ages and/or have lived in the host country for a shorter period of time might need special attention as they are more likely to suffer from poor self-rated health, a valid health status indicator that can be used in population health monitoring.

Theoretically, it sought to answers questions that help determine how Americanization---the adaptation and acculturation of a visiting culture to absorb and incorporate the host culture into their lives, customs, and social practices, and in this case savings behavior. A comprehensive model was developed to test the idea that living in America can and does have an influence on social and cultural practices. What was of interest in this study was whether or not these same influences could have an impact on particular cultural practices, in this case how people felt about, reacted to, and addressed the concept of savings--the stockpiling of funds for future needs. Information was gathered from a sample of over 500 Saudi Arabian students living in the United States. The model as structured was tested using SEM analytic techniques in an effort to fully explore and expose the nuanced and subtle differences among the respondents. The concept of savings behavior being influenced by Americanization as originally discussed was not substantiated by the model even though some of the indicators were within expected parameters (chi2 = 217.241, p < .001; CFI = 0.839, TLI = 0.732, RMSEA = 0.034). Despite the general problems the overall model revealed that at least 17% of what was termed as savings behavior could be explained by the model. The study still retained its value because it has made inroads into an area that has not yet been explored. Future investigations should take care to find better ways to incorporate some of the cultural elements of savings behavior directly into the instrument based on the perspective of their test populations rather than assume value in and use instruments tested and normed with US samples.

Since all external and internal parts of an open social system are constantly interrelated to each other, there was a relationship between acculturation levels and educational leadership practices of first generation immigrant educational leaders. The interaction among interrelated subsystems of this study was best explained by fusing acculturation theory, and transformational leadership theory under the overarching open social systems model.

The current study adds to the literature by utilizing a national sample of Latino women to examine the interpersonal victimization experiences and help-seeking responses to victimization by ethnic group. The sample was drawn from the Sexual Assault Among Latinas Study (SALAS; Cuevas & Sabina, 2010) that surveyed 2,000 self-identified adult Latino women. For the purpose of this study, victimization in the United States was examined among Mexican ethnics (73.3% of sample), Cuban ethnics (14%), and other ethnics (12.8%). Mexican ethnicity was found to be significantly associated with increased odds of experiencing any, physical, sexual, threat, and stalking victimization. Findings also show that higher levels of Latino orientation and being an immigrant were associated with decreased odds of experiencing any victimization, whereas Anglo orientation, as measured by the Brief ARSMA-II (Cuéllar, Arnold, & Maldonado, 1995), was associated with greater odds of experiencing any victimization. Anglo orientation was significantly associated with formal help seeking. Taken as a whole, these findings emphasize the importance of bilingual and culturally competent services and also reveal that culturally competent services includes developing an understanding of the cultural differences between Latino ethnic groups. Specifically, service providers should be aware that Latinos of Mexican ethnicity may face unique risks for victimization.

A path model was proposed with family climate (congruence and obligations) as predictors of acculturative stress and having both direct and indirect (via stress) effects on life satisfaction and behavioral problems. The model was tested in order to determine if paths varied significantly as a function of national context. Although New Zealand Muslims had better adaptation outcomes and lower levels of stress than their British peers, there were very few differences in the family climate-stress-adaptation pathways. Acculturative stress predicted decrements in life satisfaction and greater behavioral problems, and obligations predicted fewer behavioral problems in both cultural contexts. Also, in both countries, the structural pathways in the model were not significantly different across cultures with the exception of the positive relationship between obligations and life satisfaction, which was only evident in the New Zealand sample. For Muslim emerging adults, family obligations functioned as a protective factor, exerting direct effects on adaptation (increased life satisfaction and decreased behavioral problems), although they also posed risks, predicting poorer adaptation via heightened acculturative stress. The results are discussed in terms of the positive and negative influences of family in the acculturation process for emerging adults.

Results indicate that exposure to mainstream newspapers is only positively related to one indicator of subjective reality, namely, outgroup perception whereas exposure to ethnic newspapers was not significantly related to any of the indicators of subjective reality. Acculturation attitudes, on the other hand, are more closely related to group perception and contact but not closely associated with exposure to print media.

Factors such as cultural knowledge, length of stay in the new culture, and linguistic competence strongly influence this process. Length of stay and linguistic competence may be essential for cultural knowledge acquisition that, in turn, may be enhanced by mass media consumption. A questionnaire is completed by 576 immigrants (196 Romanians, 179 North Africans, and 201 Latino Americans) investigating time spent in Italy, proficiency in the Italian language, familiarity with Italian and homeland mass media, and acculturation. The authors hypothesize that language plays a central role in the acculturation process and assume that length of stay influences acculturation mostly through linguistic competence and mass media knowledge. A structural equation model is tested to verify the hypothesis. The model results are acceptable, invariant across genders, and partially invariant across ethno-cultural groups.

We used cross-tabulations and multivariate logistic regression to test relations between risk perceptions, immigration characteristics, and substance use. Results: More than two thirds of all respondents perceived moderate or great risk to health and well-being associated with all substances analyzed. The odds of lifetime substance use by Latino and non-Latino White immigrants were lower than for US-born non-Latino Whites. Immigrant Latinos' odds of lifetime substance use were lower than for US-born Latinos.

A second aim is to examine the influence of acculturation on psychological health, as well as to determine the interaction between all these three factors, i.e., self-construal, acculturation and psychological health. In a sample of 120 immigrants, 62 of whom were Indians and 58 Albanians, we found that integration correlates positively with interdependent self-construal and with independent self-construal, whereas separation correlates neither with independent nor with interdependent self-construal. Also, there is a statistically significant difference between the participants with high and low level of independent self-construal, with the difference to being favor of the participants with high level of independent self-construal. As far as the relationship between acculturation and psychological health is concerned, we found that separation correlates negatively with anxiety and with depression, whereas integration correlates neither with depression nor with anxiety. Even though self-construal, in conjunction with separation, is responsible for a significant proportion of depression, the results do not meet the criteria in order to conclude that self-construal is a mediator between separation and depression.

Linguistic measures were applied to the participants’ writing at the lexical, syntactic, and discourse levels, with the goal of comparing outcomes at each of these levels across languages (Spanish/English) and genres (expository/narrative). Method: Twenty Spanish-speaking ELLs, ages 11–14 years, each produced 8 expository and narrative autobiographical texts. Texts were coded and scored for lexical sophistication, syntactic complexity, and overall text quality. Scores were analyzed using Friedman’s 2-way analysis of variance by ranks (Siegel & Castellan, 1988); resulting ranks were compared across languages and genre topics. Results: The text topic impacted rank differences at all levels. Performance at the three levels was similar across languages, indicating that participants were emerging writers in both Spanish and English. The impact of genre was generally inconsequential at all levels. Conclusion: Similar results across languages implied the potential transfer of writing skills. Overall, students appeared to apply a knowledge-telling strategy to writing rather than strategically planning, composing, and revising their writing. Finally, outcomes highlighted the synergistic relationships among linguistic levels in text composition, indicating a need to address the interaction of vocabulary, morphosyntax, and text-level structures in the instruction and assessment of ELL writing.

Victoria is the most culturally diverse state in Australia (ABS, 2006) and the State Government, in their publication 'All of Us: Victoria's Multicultural Policy' (2009), has endorsed sport as an activity that contributes positively to the migrant settlement process. In this chapter we draw on data from a small-scale qualitative study conducted in Melbourne, Victoria that explored the experience of two Vietnamese families and their involvement with, Australia's most popular community sport, Australian Rules Football, (AF). In the analysis of our data we have used the ideas of cultural field and habitus, as well as other associated conceptual tools offered by Bourdieu (1990) to explore the integrative power of sport with respect to the local AF club. Our results discuss each family's involvement with their local AF club and report on the perceived benefits and barriers encountered in their level of inclusion within the club community. We argue that while the research provides some indication of integration for the families involved in the study, particularly the players, it also exhibited systemic elements of exclusion. We do however consider that there is significant potential for the integration of the Vietnamese community in the context of Australian Football in Melbourne, but it is one that requires increased understanding of and considered responses to the elements of exclusion.

Methods: We pooled the 2005 and 2007 Los Angeles County Health Survey data to construct a multilevel data set, with community-level median household income and immigrant density as predictors at the community level. After controlling for individual-level demographic variables, we included the respondent’s perceived community safety as a covariate to test the hypothesis that perceived public safety mediates the association between acculturation and health outcomes. Results: The interaction between community median household income and primarily speaking English at home was associated with lower likelihoods of physical inactivity (odds ratio [OR] = 0.644; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.502, 0.825) and obesity (OR = 0.674; 95% CI = 0.514, 0.882).

Results indicate experiences of feeling blamed, stigmatized, and misunderstood, in addition to lack of practical help. Women’s self-isolation, however, did not preclude them from engaging in spiritual behaviors, forgiveness, and beliefs in God’s benevolence and future justice.

On the other hand, the reciprocal model was supported for the relation between depressive symptoms and general hassles indicating a bidirectional, mutual relation. Unconditional latent growth models further showed that depression level remained unchanged over time, while levels of acculturation and general hassles decreased. The implications for clinical practice and immigration policy are discussed.

Particularly, the study aimed to test the distinct role of stereotypes (especially the warmth dimension) and perceived threat (especially realistic threat) in predicting the majority's perception of adaptation and the need for immigrants to adapt. Spanish participants (N =307) responded to a questionnaire assessing Moroccan, Romanian, and Ecuadorian immigrants, reporting their perceptions of adaptation and the need for immigrants to adapt to the host society, on two dimensions of stereotypes (warmth and competence), perceived (realistic and symbolic) threat, and intergroup similarity. Results showed that the majority's perceptions about immigrants were specific to the immigrant target assessed. The psychosocial variables that predicted perception of adaptation and need to adapt differed depending on the immigrant target assessed, although warmth generally predicted perception of adaptation, and perceived threat generally predicted need to adapt. Accordingly, warmth was found to be a mediator in predicting perception of adaptation, whereas perceived realistic threat was a mediator when predicting the need to adapt. Intergroup similarity was a reliable mediator in both perception of adaptation and need to adapt. Overall, warmth seemed to be more closely related with acculturation perceptions, whereas perceived threat was more related with acculturation preferences.

Method: A two-part research strategy using both quantitative and qualitative methods was employed. In the cross-sectional quantitative survey, 113 Chinese respondents completed a questionnaire investigating demographic factors, life experiences associated with migration, proficiency in the English language and mental health status. In the qualitative phase of the research, interviews were conducted with a further 24 immigrants to explore these factors in more depth. Results: In the questionnaire survey, over 60% of the group reported symptoms of poor mental health. Qualitative research shows that for those who were employed in catering, psychological adjustment was heavily dependent on strong ties with the Chinese community and there was minimal contact with the host society. By contrast, those concerned with professional development experienced conflict as a result of a high perceived need for integration and a recognition of the problems associated with this. Conclusion: The psychological distress experienced by immigrants of Chinese origin continues to be a largely invisible cause for concern.

Design/methodology/approach: The sample consisted of 141 host community (Dutch) and 41 non-western immigrant workers of a postal service company who filled out a questionnaire. Methods of analyses include analysis of variance and multiple regression. Findings: In line with the IAM, results showed that a higher disconcordance in preferred acculturation orientations between host community and immigrant workers related to a poorer quality of intergroup work-relations. However, intergroup contact moderated this relationship differently for host community and immigrant workers. Research limitations/implications: Data are cross-sectional and collected in one organization. Future studies should replicate the findings to other organizational contexts, cultural groups, and collect longitudinal data to determine causal effects. Practical implications: Organizations should monitor disconcordance in acculturation orientations amongst host community and immigrant workers. A multicultural culture in organizations may reduce disconcordance in acculturation orientations between host community and immigrant workers. Originality/value: The paper helps to explain the mixed findings in cultural diversity research so far, by demonstrating that disconcordance in acculturation orientations relates negatively to intergroup work-relations in a multicultural workplace.

Methods: A representative community sample of 1,747 Chinese Americans (aged 18-65 years), selected by a multi-stage household sampling design, in the Los Angeles County was interviewed to tap their psychiatric diagnoses, symptomatology, level of acculturation, stress, and support. Results: Across all indices, Chinese Americans' level of somatic symptoms, impairment related to somatization, and percentage of meeting the Somatic Symptom Index 5/5 (SSI 5/5) criterion were comparable to those found in other populations. Length of residence in the U.S. and acculturation were not related to somatization. Regression analyses showed that anxiety, depression, gender, age, education, stressors, and support were significantly related to somatization, ps < 0.05. Somatizers tended to perceive themselves with poor health and utilized both Western and indigenous Chinese medicine. Conclusion: The importance of demographics, psychological distress, and stress was emphasized in the explanation of somatization tendencies among immigrant Chinese Americans. Somatization might be a stress response with regard to increased distress severity and psychosocial stressors rather than a cultural response to express psychological problems in somatic terms.

In this study, we took into account that MDD is a gene-environment disorder, in which stress is a critical component, and used whole-genome screening of functional variants to investigate the ‘missing heritability’ in MDD. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using single- and multi-locus linear mixed-effect models were performed in a Los Angeles Mexican- American cohort (196 controls, 203 MDD) and in a replication European-ancestry cohort (499 controls, 473 MDD). Our analyses took into consideration the stress levels in the control populations. The Mexican-American controls, comprised primarily of recent immigrants, had high levels of stress due to acculturation issues and the European-ancestry controls with high stress levels were given higher weights in our analysis. We identified 44 common and rare functional variants associated with mild to moderate MDD in the Mexican-American cohort (genome-wide false discovery rate, FDR, <0.05), and their pathway analysis revealed that the three top overrepresented Gene Ontology (GO) processes were innate immune response, glutamate receptor signaling and detection of chemical stimulus in smell sensory perception. Rare variant analysis replicated the association of the PHF21B gene in the ethnically unrelated European-ancestry cohort. The TRPM2 gene, previously implicated in mood disorders, may also be considered replicated by our analyses. Whole-genome sequencing analyses of a subset of the cohorts revealed that Europeanancestry individuals have a significantly reduced (50%) number of single nucleotide variants compared with Mexican-American individuals, and for this reason the role of rare variants may vary across populations. PHF21b variants contribute significantly to differences in the levels of expression of this gene in several brain areas, including the hippocampus. Furthermore, using an animal model of stress, we found that Phf21b hippocampal gene expression is significantly decreased in animals resilient to chronic restraint stress when compared with non-chronically stressed animals. Together, our results reveal that including stress level data enables the identification of novel rare functional variants associated with MDD.

Looking beyond statistics and architectural spectacles, I examine a seemingly personal choice in Shanghai, speaking Putonghua Mandarin, the official language, or the Shanghai dialect. This study contextualizes the contested urban linguistic space, and illustrates the political, social, and cultural conditions in this China's globalizing city. Through archival research, fifty in-depth interviews, two hundred and fifty survey questionnaires, and ethnographic fieldwork in Shanghai in the fall and winter of 2013, I document the impact of three sets of state policies driving the Shanghai dialect to the brink of extinction, and reactions of Shanghairen (Shanghai people) to preserve their linguistic heritage, and to safeguard their place-bound identity. First, state language policies systematically put Shanghai dialect at a discriminated position, through a nationalist agenda associating the official language with patriotism, and upward social mobility. In response to this state-sponsored language oppression, a grassroots dialect preservation movements struggles to protect Shanghai's linguistic heritage. Second, urban redevelopment policies to accommodate the infrastructure demanded by a global city displaced more than one million Shanghai households out of the urban center. It not only deprives them of the urban central residency, challenges their claim to urban public space, but also disperses the Shanghai dialect community. Facing an urban built environment bearing little relevance to Shanghai's history and long-time residents, Shanghairen rejects newly-built architectural spectacles and articulates an alternative image of cosmopolitan Shanghai located in the historical urban center. The third reason behind the rapid decline of Shanghai dialect speaking is the influx of millions of internal migrants, and the selective social integration of these non-speakers in Shanghai after reforms of the household registration (hukou) system. Instead of a dual society characterized by those with a Shanghai urban hukou and those without, my study suggests a more nuanced social class restructuring. On the one hand, migrants now have better overall chances for social acceptance and integration as institutional barriers represented by an individual's hukou status have receded; on the other hand, social and cultural boundaries are effectively maintained through language and lifestyle. Only those highly educated and wealthy newcomers are accepted on the job market and in social circles, while less-educated rural migrants are excluded. To synthesize, in exchange for Shanghai's global city status and improved standard of living, Shanghairen have been relocated away from the urban center, while their linguistic right to the city is threatened. They have also experienced relative deprivation of privileges in terms of exclusive access to employment and top quality social services. In this study, they come together to tell a story of the price locals pay when an authoritarian, centralized state fashions a city compatible with and competitive for globalization.

A cross-sectional survey was conducted on a sample of 99 Mexican-origin adults living in California. To test the hypotheses a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA), and post-hoc tests. Dependent variables were assessed using the following measures: Center for Epidemiological Studies Scale (CES-D), the Personality Assessment Inventory Anxiety scale (PAI ANX), Hispanic Stress Inventory (HSI), a modified version of the Perceived Racism Scale for Latina/os (PRSL), 7-item Fear of Deportation (Arbona et al., 2010), and a single question adopted from a survey conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center regarding fear of deportation (2007). The impetus for this study was to examine the psychological implications of immigration and citizenship status and to address a gap in research regarding mental health among undocumented Mexican immigrants. It was hypothesized that: (a) the undocumented Mexican immigrant group would report significantly higher levels of depression and anxiety, relative to the documented Mexican immigrant or U.S. born Mexican American groups, (b) in comparison to the documented immigrant and U.S. born status groups, the undocumented immigrant status group would report significantly higher levels of acculturative and discrimination stress, (c) undocumented and documented Mexican immigrant status groups would report similar levels of fear of deportation, (d) the undocumented immigrant group would report significantly higher levels of immigration stress, relative to the documented immigrant group, (e) and acculturative stress would differentiate between the three immigration and citizenship status groups. Results indicate that with the exception of discrimination and acculturative stress, mental health outcomes and acculturation stressors differed based on immigration and citizenship status among all three status groups. That is, undocumented Mexican immigrants reported significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety, immigration stress, and fear of deportation, than documented Mexican immigrants or U.S. born Mexican Americans. Post hoc analysis revealed that the depression variable was a significant predictor, followed by the acculturative stress variable. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed.

A qualitative interview guide was developed using Gordon’s assimilation theory, and 21 caregivers (M age = 68 years, 86% female, seven in each generation) were interviewed. Despite the 3rd-generation caregivers’ high acculturation level, their filial responsibility scores remained high.

This study aimed at identifying such subgroups, predicting group membership by pre-migration factors, and testing for acculturation-related experiences with the host culture over time. The sample comprised 366 adolescent diaspora migrants (59% female, 16 years old) from the former Soviet Union to Germany. A person-oriented and longitudinal approach using growth mixture modeling revealed three subtypes of cultural identification change. The first subgroup (Idealists) comprised adolescents with high and stable identification with their host culture and low but increasing identification with their heritage culture. The second group (Skeptics) showed low and stable identification with their host culture and high but decreasing identification with their heritage culture. The third group (Realists) reported medium-level and stable identification with both host and heritage cultures. Group comparisons showed pre-migration differences: Idealists and Realists most likely spoke the host-culture language (i.e., German) as a native language and Idealists reported the highest level of maternal education. Membership in subgroups also related to adolescents’ perception of their current situation in the host culture: Idealists reported less acculturation-related hassles with respect to language and socio-cultural adaptation. Skeptics perceived lower expectations by natives to get in contact with natives and higher expectations to spend time with members of their immigrant group than the average immigrant. Results highlight the heterogeneity in immigrant populations and their specific needs before and after the actual migration.

This study aimed to enhance our understanding on the relationship between acculturation orientation and second language (L2) learning. It generated two conceptual models to describe how cultural identification affects language learning as hypothesized in different theories on identity and L2 learning and tested these two hypothesized models in the immigration context of Hong Kong. A survey was conducted among a group of senior high school South Asian minority students on their learning of the language of the host culture, Chinese, to provide the basis for comparison. It was found that the students mainly adopted the bicultural/integration orientation and that bicultural orientation was the optimal acculturation orientation for learning Chinese. Bicultural orientation influenced the participants' Chinese language learning outcome through impacting psychosocial well-being and engagement with the target language and community. The findings suggest that we need to take both linguistic and psychosocial adjustment factors into consideration when conceptualizing the role of identity in L2 learning. Furthermore, this study cautions us against a context-independent stance toward the utility of assimilation for language learning.

It was hypothesized that social support will predict perceived social status which, in turn, is an important factor in predicting physical health among Mexican immigrants. The current paper also hypothesized that stress mediates the relationship between perceived social status and health. Three hundred and twenty male and female Mexican immigrants (ages 18-79) completed questionnaires, wore ambulatory blood pressure monitors for 24 hours, and submitted blood samples. Results supported some, but not most hypotheses. Greater social support was related to higher perceived social status ( p = 0.01) and stress mediated two indirect relationships between perceived social status and health outcomes. Specifically, as perceived social status increased calories consumed decreased (p = 0.01) and self-reported health improved (p = 0.02). Still, there were no direct relationships between perceived social status and health outcomes and only two stress mediated relationships. Implications of the results and future directions are addressed. The paper discusses the possibility that higher education and possible variations in degree of acculturation among study participants might have resulted in a unique relationship between perceived social status and health. The paper also addresses the role that a high LDS affiliation among participants might play in the relationship between perceived social status and health of Hispanic immigrants.

The current study examined whether levels of religiosity interacted with distinct forms of acculturative stress in the prediction of depression and well-being for Muslim youth in New Zealand. Results painted a complex picture of the relationships between religiosity and mental health, finding that greater religiosity is generally positive for youth outcomes, but it also carries the risk lowering levels of mental health through its interactions with acculturative stress.

Hypotheses are formulated by drawing upon a variety of theories—scientific worldview, insecurity, religious markets, and social integration. The hypotheses are tested using European Social Survey data (2002–2008) from more than 10,000 first-generation immigrants living in 27 receiving countries. Multilevel models show that, on the individual level, religiosity is higher among immigrants who are unemployed, less educated, and who have recently arrived in the host country. On the contextual level, the religiosity of natives positively affects immigrant religiosity. The models explain about 60 percent of the cross-national differences in religious attendance and praying of immigrants and about 20 percent of the cross-national differences in subjective religiosity.

Using data from the 2000 decennial census and the 2007–2011 American Community Survey, we provide new evidence on the residential segregation patterns of whites from minorities by SES (income, education, and poverty). Results from our comprehensive analyses indicate that SES matters for the segregation patterns of whites from minorities. In particular, we find that whites as a whole are less segregated from higher-SES minority group members than lower-SES ones. Among whites, those of higher SES are more segregated from blacks and Hispanics as a whole and less segregated from Asians, indicating the importance of SES differentials across racial/ethnic groups in shaping residential patterns. We also find that during the 2000s, white–black segregation remained stable or declined, while whites became more segregated from Hispanics and Asians by all SES indicators. Fixed-effects models indicate that increasing white-minority SES segregation was fueled in part by increases in a metropolitan area’s immigrant and elderly populations, minority poverty rate, and home values, while declining segregation was associated with rising education levels and new housing construction.

The stress of identity and body image development can be exacerbated by acculturative stress faced by immigrant adolescents.

Analyses included an exploratory two-step clustering technique using maximum likelihood estimation procedures to assign class membership. Follow-up analyses then examined latent class membership by adolescent age, gender, culture of origin, and immigration generation. Results indicated several meaningful latent groups of adolescents based on their BID, acculturation, and BMI. These profiles included one in which adolescents who were underweight and more assimilated to US culture also reported more satisfaction with their body image. A second profile emerged of adolescents who were normal weight or overweight and less assimilated, who also reported higher levels of body image dissatisfaction, with a desire to be thinner. The third cluster profile included adolescents who were of normal weight, but were higher on assimilation and were among the most dissatisfied with their body image.

Three hundred two Iranian immigrants aged 65 years and over who had lived in the Sydney Metropolitan area for at least six months participated. Data were collected using a written survey instrument, face-to-face interviews, and telephone interviews. Iranian immigrants had higher levels of psychological distress, more limited physical function, greater need for help or assistance with activities of daily living, lower feelings of wellbeing, and were much less likely to use aged care services than the general population of older Australians. Participants who did not speak English at home were more likely to experience psychological distress and had greater limitations in their physical functioning. Elderly Iranians with better English proficiency had lower levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms and reported less need for help and supervision in activities of daily living; they were also more likely to access health care services. Elderly Iranian immigrants experience higher levels of psychological distress and lower levels of physical function than the general population of older Australians; those with limited proficiency in English are at greatest risk.

Research suggests that clothing is part of a dynamic social process, linked to ethnic identity, religious identity, and self-esteem. However, psychological research examining immigrants’ clothing choices remains scant. The present studies examine links between clothing preference, acculturation strategies and cultural identity among immigrants. Study 1 explored meanings and symbolism of Canadian/Western versus ethnic clothing for Chinese, Korean, and Indian immigrants (N = 15) through qualitative methodology. Participants described wearing ethnic clothing to express pride in and identification with heritage culture, while wearing Canadian clothing for practicality and to match social norms. Studies 2 and 3 surveyed Chinese, Indian, and European Canadians. Study 2 (N = 324) examined relations between ethnic identity and attitudes toward Canadian and ethnic clothing. Study 3 (N = 196) examined attitudes toward clothing (formal vs. casual) in different contexts (among peers of same or different ethnic background). Both immigrant groups reported being more likely to wear ethnic clothing among members of the same ethnicity but were otherwise more likely to wear Canadian clothing. Once social context was accounted for, there was a relation between ethnic identity and likelihood of wearing ethnic clothing. This effect was found for Chinese Canadians. Overall, our findings suggest that immigrants’ clothing choices are influenced by who they interact with.

In the study, 202 Central American men from a Mid-Atlantic urban region of the United States completed paper-and-pencil questionnaire instruments.

The data analyses employed a logistical regression model to test the effects that the predictor variables (cognitive appraisals, personality traits, machismo/caballerismo, and acculturation) had on the criterion variables (coping styles and well-being). The findings revealed that cultural (acculturation) and perceptual (cognitive appraisals) were the only significant predictors of well-being and coping in Central American men. This indicates that the Central American men in this study appraise and cope with stress using the same mechanisms as the mainstream population, according to the SCM. In addition, these findings indicate that psychological well-being was mitigated by perceptions of the stressor rather than our coping mechanisms.

One problem with this migration is that 1st and 2nd generation immigrants may prefer different leadership styles than those of the mainstream culture. The purpose of this survey-based quantitative comparative study was to investigate the effects of acculturation on the work-related cultural values and leadership style preferences of Mexican immigrants living in the United States. The research question that guided this study focused on the differences in work-related cultural values and preferred leadership styles between 2 generations of Mexican immigrants, Mexicans, and U.S.-born Caucasians. Two hundred and forty-five participants completed the survey. The researcher used a Likert-type self-assessing questionnaire adapted from existing instruments to measure the work-related cultural values and preferred leadership styles of two generations of Mexican immigrants, native Mexicans, and U.S.-born Caucasians. Statistical tools, such as correlations, Cronbach's alpha, t-test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to test measurement reliability and to test for differences in the mean scores of the criterion variables among the 4 groups. The researcher found that, in the aggregate, Mexican immigrants did not acculturate to the mainstream values of the United States, 2nd generation Mexican immigrants' scores were similar to those of U.S.-born Caucasians in work-related values, and all groups prefer the servant leadership style. Implications for social change may include raising the awareness of human resource managers of the differences and similarities in values and preferences of their staff, which may help improve the relationships between managers and the employees.

Method: Data collected from a sample of Asian Indian women immigrants residing in Sydney, Australia, were used to examine the psychometric properties of the MASS using confirmatory factor analysis. Results: A total of 203 Indian women immigrants with an average age of 66.11 years [standard deviation (SD) ± 9.60; range 50–90) participated in the study. The majority of the participants were born in India (n = 142; 70%) and their length of stay in Australia was between 1 month and 42 years. The original 24‐item, five‐factor MASS structure was confirmed, and the model showed a good fit to the data: comparative fit index = 0.93; root mean square error of approximation = 0.06; and standardised root mean square residual = 0.08. The Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the five subscales ranged from 0.80 to 0.93 and was 0.91 for the overall scale demonstrating high internal consistency. Conclusions: The findings confirm the factor structure and reliability of the MASS for assessing acculturative stress among female Asian Indian immigrants.

There are a growing number of scholars who are investigating the role of social networks that have shown that the number and even types of social networks among minorities and lower income groups differ (Chatman,1991; Ball, Warheit, Vandiver, & Holzer, 1980; Glass, Mendes De Leon, Seeman, &Berkman, 1997; Palmore, 1981; Kaugh 1999). Very few scholars, however, have examined the use of social support in social networks to retrieve health information. In particular, no extant studies examine both availability of social support and social networks and health information seeking behaviors for Korean immigrants (first generation). This dissertation examined the influences of social support networks on health information seeking behaviors to increase understanding about the important influences of social networks on health information seeking by immigrants, especially the use of the Internet for health information. More specifically, this study will investigate the effects of (a) demographic factors including age, gender, acculturation, (b) perceived social support, and (c) social networks on online health information seeking behaviors among Korean immigrants. Health information seeking behaviors are examined in these four areas: (1) different health information sources from social networks, (2) topics of health information from social networks, (3) online health information seeking behaviors. An intramethod approach (Johnson & Turner, 2003) utilizing both qualitative and quantitative approaches was used to provide both specificity of response (with closed-ended questions) and depth of response (with open-ended questions). An online survey was administered to 205 Korean American men and women aged 18-49 who identified themselves as first generation Korean American immigrants (e.g., foreign-born Korean immigrants refer to those individuals who have emigrated from Korea to the United States). The open-ended questions explored the importance of social support and social networks in health information seeking behavior for Korean Americans. The survey data expanded knowledge about the relationships between social support, social networks, and health information seeking behaviors, in particular online health information seeking. The results from the qualitative data were collected to add to existing literature in health communication by demonstrating why social support and social networks are important for immigrants. These findings also intended to extend current research on health information seeking behaviors and social support to the Korean immigrant population in the U.S. The results from the survey capture how the availability of social support and the size of social networks can influence health information seeking behaviors. The findings from this current study enhance the utility of SNT as a theory, as well as our understanding of health communication for immigrants. SNT was applied here for the first time in a health communication study of Korean immigrants' health information seeking behaviors. The results demonstrated how social networks function as sources of heath information for Korean Americans within the SNT framework. Hence, the utility of this theory was expanded to include health disparities and immigrant contexts. In addition, for health care practitioners and public policy makers, this study provides empirical evidence about the unique use of online health information and social network members as health information sources among Korean Americans. As this study's results suggest, in-group online communities can be effective channels for disseminating important health information targeting Korean Americans.

Years of living in the U.S. was a significant and positive predictor of acculturative stress, and social support was the strongest predictor of acculturative stress and it was negatively associated with acculturative stress. Acculturative stress and social support were significant predictors of family satisfaction. However, social support did not moderate the effect of acculturative stress on family satisfaction. Familial stress factor had the strongest negative relationship with family satisfaction. There was no significant difference between males and females in regards to the levels of acculturative stress, family satisfaction, and social support. Marriage and family therapists should consider how acculturative stress and immigration history affect their clients' family satisfaction and mental health.

Further guided by the theory of intergroup anxiety, this study also adopted a context-specific approach to distinguish between participants’ experience of social anxiety when interacting with European Americans versus with other Chinese in the United States. This quantitative and ex post facto study used a convenience sample of 140 first-generation Chinese immigrants. Participants were recruited through e-mails from different university and community groups across the United States. The sample includes 55 men and 82 women (3 did not specify) with an average age of 36 years old. Results showed that more social anxiety was reported in the European American context than in the Chinese ethnic context. The full models accounted for almost half the variance in anxiety in each context. Although personality accounted for the most variance, the cultural variables and discrimination contributed 14% of the unique variance in the European American context. Notably, low acculturation, high neuroticism, and low extraversion were unique contributors to social anxiety with European Americans, whereas in the Chinese ethnic context only low extraversion was a unique contributor; more discrimination was uniquely significant in both contexts. The findings suggest a need to contextualize the research and clinical assessment of social anxiety, and have implications for culturally sensitive counseling with immigrants.

However, because assimilation differs from separation on both the home culture component and the host culture component, the actual source of this effect remains unclear. By using an assimilation versus integration contrast that differ only on the home culture component, the present study confirmed and extended Thomsen et al.’s findings. We were able to conclude that this counter intuitive effect, at odds with most research in this area, is primarily driven by people with high SDO having more negative reactions to immigrants’ willing to abandon their original cultures rather than to immigrants wanting to maintain contact with the host culture.

No study has compared the unmet supportive care needs of immigrant Arab cancer survivors with Arab cancer survivors living in their native country. Objective: To explore the unmet supportive care needs of both Arab Australian and Arab Jordanian cancer survivors. Methods: Arab people living in Sydney, Australia, and Amman, Jordan, and diagnosed with cancer within the last 5 years were invited to complete a questionnaire that measured unmet supportive care needs, depression, and language acculturation. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of unmet supportive care needs. Results: Seventy-seven Arab Jordanian and 66 Arab Australian cancer survivors were recruited. Australian participants were older than their Jordanian counterparts (61.5 vs 52.3 years; P < .001) and reported higher levels of overall unmet needs (44.9 vs 36.1; P = .012). Controlling for age and stage of cancer diagnosis, higher levels of depression (β = .34) and living in Australia (β = .26) were significant predictors of unmet needs and explained almost 17% of the variance. Conclusions: These findings have extended our understanding of the unmet supportive care needs of Arab cancer survivors and confirm disparities in unmet needs in immigrant populations. Implications for Practice: Greater attention is needed to ensure the supportive care needs are met for immigrant patients with cancer. Additional strategies to address physical and psychological needs are particularly needed in this group.

This moderating effect was unique to the relationship between SDO and feelings toward Syrians and did not extend to other correlates of prejudice including beliefs in zero-sum group competition or a multicultural ideology, nor did it extend to more general measures of prejudice (i.e., attitudes toward immigrants or evaluations of intercultural contact).

Previous research among Hispanic women has suggested that acculturation positively influences health beliefs and preventive health behaviors. However, research has not yet extended to other growing immigrant groups, including women from Haiti and the English-speaking Caribbean, and has not tested whether time spent in the United States differentially impacts breast screening across groups that are known to vary in their health beliefs. As expected, time spent in the United States was associated with a greater number of mammograms and clinical breast exams. Importantly, these relations held even when controlling for (a) age, income, education, marital status; (b) morbidity, health insurance, physician's recommendation, physical exams; and (c) ethnicity. Moreover, time spent in the United States interacted with being Haitian to predict the number of clinical breast exams. Even though Haitians were less likely to utilize breast cancer screening overall, time spent in the United States had a stronger effect on the number of clinical breast exams for Haitian women.

For this purpose, large samples of students were assessed at both locations in the 1980s and about two decades later. Our research question was whether the frequency of eating disorder-related psychopathology had changed over time and that there were differences between migrants and nonmigrants. The present-day prevalence of eating disorders in the Greek population was established. Method: Greek adolescents were assessed in Munich and Veria in the 1980s (N=2,631) and almost two decades later (N=2,920). At both times, the Anorexia Nervosa Inventory for Self-Rating (ANIS) was used to assess eating disorder pathology and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) was used to assess mental health status. In the second wave, persons at risk for an eating disorder were interviewed using the Structured Interview for Anorexic and Bulimic Syndromes (SIAB-EX). Results: At both times and both locations, adolescent girls in comparison to boys had higher, more pathologic scores on the GHQ-28 and on all ANIS self-rating subscales. Females in Munich reported an increase over time in figure consciousness and their fear of negative effects of meals. In the 1980s, significantly higher scores of bulimic behavior were found in Veria as compared with Munich. In the second wave, bulimic behavior was considerably decreased in Veria for both girls and boys, and for bulimic behavior no significant differences were found between locations. The percentage of girls with a low body weight (<5th percentile) increased significantly over time in Veria and Munich. In the second wave, the current prevalence for girls with anorexia nervosa was 0.00% in Munich and 0.59% in Veria (lifetime 1.26% and 1.18%, respectively). For bulimia nervosa, current prevalence was 1.89% in Munich and 1.18% in Veria. Conclusion: Differences between locations diminished over time. Bulimic syndromes are prevalent in both locations.

However, little is known about the sources and predictors of social anxiety under the context of cultural change. Based on the diathesis-stress framework of social anxiety (Rapee & Spence, 2004), which posits that social anxiety is resulted from the interaction of genetic, cultural and environmental factors, this study examined relationships among social anxiety and personality traits (neuroticism and extraversion), cultural adaptation (acculturation, enculturation and perceived English fluency), and an environmental stressor (perceived racial discrimination). Participants were 140 first-generation Chinese/Taiwanese immigrants, aged 18 to 71. A unique feature of this study is that social anxiety was assessed in two social contexts: mainstream society and ethnic community. That is, participants reported their levels of social anxiety interacting with mainstream White Americans (Mainstream SA) and with other Chinese in the U.S. (Ethnic SA), as measured by the revised Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (Mattick & Clarke, 1998). It was hypothesized that participants would report experiencing significantly more Mainstream SA than Ethnic SA. Neuroticism, extraversion, acculturation, perceived English fluency and perceived racial discrimination were hypothesized to jointly and uniquely predict Mainstream SA. Moreover, neuroticism, extraversion and enculturation were hypothesized to jointly and uniquely predict Ethnic SA. All hypotheses were supported at p ≤ .017. First, a dependent t-test indicated that scores on Mainstream SA were significantly higher than scores on Ethnic SA. Second, hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that personality traits contributed 35% of the variance in the prediction of Mainstream SA. Cultural factors contributed an additional 10% of the variance after controlling for personality traits. Perceived racial discrimination accounted for an additional 4% of the variance. The full model explained a total of 48% of the variance in Mainstream SA with extraversion, neuroticism and perceived discrimination being the unique predictors. With respect to Ethnic SA, personality traits contributed 29% of the variance. Cultural factors added an additional 5% of the variance after controlling for personality traits. Perceived racial discrimination added an additional 8% of the variance. The full model explained 43% of the variance in Ethnic SA with extraversion and perceived discrimination being the unique predictors. Implications for theory, research and practice with Chinese/Taiwanese immigrants are discussed. In particular, results of this study highlight the importance of assessing social anxiety symptoms in different social contexts, particularly for immigrants.

Research based on assimilation models has previously noted that immigration may affect minority drinking patterns but has failed to acknowledge the possibility that immigration may change the host drinking patterns. The current study applies a bidirectional acculturation model to analyze if, and in what ways, mass emigration from the former Soviet Union (fSU) to Israel may have influenced immigrant drinking habits as well as the drinking patterns of veteran Israelis. Method: A cross-sectional pooled nationally representative stratified simple random sample of the young Israeli Jewish adult population (ages 21–40 years) from 2004 and 2009 was used (n = 1,357; women = 52.7%). Logistic regression examined differences in drinking patterns and differences over time between fSU immigrants and veteran Israelis. Results: There has been a convergence in moderate drinking habits between the two populations, and this convergence is attributed to increases in veteran Israeli moderate drinking over time but not to decreases in fSU immigrant drinking habits. Results also show that heavy drinking is increasing among veteran Israelis but that fSU immigrants continue to drink more heavily and to be more likely to prefer distilled spirits than veteran Israelis. Conclusions: A bidirectional acculturation model may be more appropriate than assimilation models for the study of immigrant drinking patterns because it acknowledges the possibility of changes in immigrant as well as host drinking customs.

In stark contrast, the migration of Africans beyond the continent, which occurs on a smaller scale, is routinely associated with diaspora formation. Drawing on fieldwork with migrants from Anglophone and Francophone West Africa and the Horn of Africa living in Lusaka and Kampala, this paper explores whether their movements gives rise to the formation of diasporic connections that sustain and reproduce identifications with the place and people of origin, over distance and through generations. The analysis illustrates how different layers of ‘origin’ and ‘destination’ factors interact to reinforce or undermine diasporic identifications in Africa’s urban landscapes. The homeland where mobility is embedded in socioeconomic relations that embrace transnational linkages may perpetuate connections. The conditions of urban life that impose pressures to remain outsiders may perpetuate exclusion and hinder integration.

Numerous studies have described how migration from poor countries and regions to more developed ones leads migrants to adopt a modern diet associated to the risk of acquiring chronic diseases. However, different contexts might influence dietary change in migrants in diverse ways. For this purpose, 28 semi-structured interviews were conducted with adult, female internal migrants to a border city in Mexico. The interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. The results showed trajectories of dietary change to be associated to social position before and after migration. For the participants from rural areas, migration was accompanied by an increase in the consumption of processed foods, and also changes in food insecurity. Migrants who came from urban areas reported a decrease in the perceived quality of food available to them, but their eating pattern was modified only slightly.

To date, however, we have limited understanding of the determinants of marriage migrants' wellbeing in the marriage and migration processes. To further examine the positive social and health consequences of intra-Asia marriage migration, this dissertation uses the National Survey on Multicultural Families in South Korea (N=69,394), forty-eight in-depth interviews, and a year of multi-sited fieldwork working with sixteen migrant organizations in both rural and urban settings, to answer one major research question: how do transnational marriage and gendered migration affect the wellbeing of Asian women migrants in Taiwan and South Korea? I found that gender dynamics, socioeconomic status, and social integration are three key and interconnected determinants of marriage migrants' health and wellbeing. Specifically, marital power dynamics between marriage migrants and their husbands have a direct effect on marriage migrants' self-rated health, life satisfaction, and views on marriage migration; marriage migrants' exposure to gender-based bias affects their propensity to marry across borders through different channels, while the flexibility of gender structure in the marital families is critical in marriage migrants' double transition of becoming married women and becoming migrants. On the one hand, the socioeconomic status of marital families is more important to marriage migrants' self-rated health and life satisfaction than the education of their husbands. On the other hand, the social standing of natal families reveals little effect on marriage migrants' post-migration wellbeing, yet marriage migrants' own education has a reverse effect on how they value the experience of transnational marriage migration. In terms of the various dimensions of social integration, social relationships with the native populations affect marriage migrants' health in a positive way, yet social relationships with co-ethnics turn out to influence their health negatively. Overall, marriage migrants' gendered social roles—as wives, daughters-in-law, and mothers—in the marital families allow them to better negotiate their individual agency, which is defined as their ability to act independently and make free choices. The sense of belonging gained through participating in these family roles serves as a strong foundation for marriage migrants to further integrate into the host societies as migrant groups through taking on social roles as community members and citizens. By using multiple measures of gender dynamics, socioeconomic status, and social integration, I show both (1) the quantitative significance of these factors to the health and wellbeing of marriage migrants from different Asian ethnicities/countries of origin in South Korea, and (2) the qualitative importance of these factors in shaping the life trajectories of Vietnamese marriage migrants in Taiwan and South Korea who met their husbands through different marriage channels at different stages of their lives. In conclusion, this dissertation illustrates the diverse experiences of intra-Asia marriage migrants and emphasizes the importance of marriage migrants' wellbeing to their marital families, host societies, and the developmental trajectories of their bi-ethnic children. Using the case of transnational marriage migrants, whose social positions are marginalized by multiple social hierarchies of gender, class, ethnicity, nativity, and capitalist globalization, I suggest that… (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",NA,NA,"Dissertation Abstracts International Section A: Humanities and Social Sciences",NA,"04194209","20150101","75","7-A(E)",NA,NA,NA,"2015-99010-517",NA,"ProQuest Information & Learning","Asians; Immigration; Marriage; Well Being; Wives; Health; Interracial Marriage; Life Satisfaction; Sex Roles; Female",NA,"http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=psyh&AN=2015-99010-517&site=ehost-live&scope=site",FALSE,"P-1280",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Method: A semistructured interview including questionnaires assessing sociodemographic information, pre-migration trauma, anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress, post-migration living difficulties and perceived social support were administered assisted by a bilingual community worker. Results: Resettled refugees from Sudan evidenced a history of trauma. Less than 5% met criteria for posttraumatic stress but 25% reported clinically high levels of psychological distress. The results indicate that social support - particularly perceived social support from the migrant's ethnic community - play a significant role in predicting mental health outcomes. Pre-migration trauma, family status and gender were also associated with mental health outcomes. Conclusions: Refugees in Australia may constitute a particularly vulnerable group in terms of mental health outcomes.

However, the researches have not included immigrants from the English-speaking Caribbean islands. This research investigated the West Indian immigrant's adjustment and how they are affected by acculturation. It explored the relationship between acculturation, ethnic identity, gender differences, biculturalism, and protective factors of the English-speaking people from the West Indies living in Canada. Acculturation has been around for many centuries and there have been many definitions. One definition describes acculturation as the following: 'Those phenomena which result when groups of individuals having different cultures come into continuous first-hand contact' causing 'changes in the original culture patterns of either or both groups' (Redfield, Linton & Herskovits, 1936, as cited in Rudmin & Ahmzdzadeh, 2001, page 41). The sample consisted of 99 adults, 67 women, and 32 men. These individuals voluntarily participated in this research and were recruited by flyers, e-mail, and word of mouth. Participants completed a packet containing demographic and acculturation questionnaires about their experiences with migrating and acculturating to the social and cultural changes related to a new way of life and living in the Canadian society. It was found that Caribbean immigrants retained their ethnic identity. Women appeared to have experienced more distress than men, to have exhibited bicultural competence and to have had a vast support network and coping strategies. The findings are discussed within the context of acculturation to the Canadian society and will be best understood from a cultural, social, and psychological perspective in better understanding the Caribbean immigrants in Canada. In addition, the limitations of the study and future research direction are presented.

We evaluate whether factors related to the processes of acculturation and enculturation, immigration factors, family stressors and supports, contextual factors, and social status in the US account for differences in 12-month prevalence of psychiatric disorders for eight subgroups of Latinos. We report results that differentiate Latino respondents by country of origin and age at immigration (whether they were US-born or arrived before age 6: In-US-as-Child [IUSC]; or whether they arrived after age 6: later-arrival immigrants [LAI]). After age and gender adjustments, LAI Mexicans and IUSC Cubans reported a significantly lower prevalence of depressive disorders than IUSC Mexicans. Once we adjust for differences in family stressors, contextual factors and social status factors, these differences are no longer significant. The risk for anxiety disorders appears no different for LAI compared to IUSC Latinos, after age and gender adjustments. For substance use disorders, family factors do not offset the elevated risk of early exposure to neighborhood disadvantage, but coming to the US after age 25 does offset it. Family conflict and burden were consistently related to the risk of mood disorders. Our findings suggest that successful adaptation into the US is a multidimensional process that includes maintenance of family harmony, integration in advantageous US neighborhoods, and positive perceptions of social standing. Our results uncover that nativity may be a less important independent risk factor for current psychiatric morbidity than originally thought.

Bowlby's grieving process was used as a theoretical framework to explore grief reactions to leaving the homeland (homesickness) resulting from exposure to a new culture. Crucial to successful settlement was the nature of strategies the women used to negotiate the grieving process. Participants who successfully settled and re-invented themselves engaged in more social, cultural and country activities - those participants who were less successful in this endeavour tended toward more solitary strategies. The study has social implications for future migrants to utilize appropriate strategies that could reduce the psychological impact of relocation.

Only a few studies describe psychopathological dimensions in migrants over their nosographic diagnoses; however, there is a growing literature about the greater utility of a categorical-dimensional approach, rather than a solely categorical approach, in the understanding of mental disorders. The aim of this paper is to describe the phenomenology of mental disorders in migrants referred to the Transcultural Psychiatric Team of Bologna (BoTPT), by analysing the psychopathological dimensions that underlie their clinical diagnoses. Methods: We recruited all migrants who attended the BoTPT between May 1999 and July 2009. The psychopathological assessment was conducted with the Association for Methodology and Documentation in Psychiatry (AMDP) and clinical diagnoses were formulated according to ICD-10. We proceeded through a two-step analysis: (1) comparing the prevalence rates of psychopathological symptoms across diagnoses; then (2) conducting a factor analysis to assess how those symptoms configure psychopathological dimensions and how these dimensions underlie clinical diagnoses. Results: As expected, we found significant associations between diagnoses and the prevalence of their core psychopathological symptoms. Factor analysis revealed a strong polymorphism of the psychopathological presentation of mental disorders and unexpectedly showed that in each diagnostic cluster, the first extracted factor was not composed of core symptoms. Conclusions: A mixed categorical-dimensional approach seems to improve the description of the psychopathology among migrants, as it adds relevant information regarding psychopathological dimensions useful to the understanding of the peculiar clinical expressivity of our patients.

Questionnaires developed to measure acculturation are typically designed for specific ethnic populations and adult experiences. This study developed a questionnaire that measures acculturation among ethnically diverse populations of youth that can be included as a module in population surveys. Methods: Questionnaires measuring acculturation in youth were identified in the literature. The importance of items from the existing questionnaires was determined using a Delphi process and this informed the development of our questionnaire. The questionnaire was then pilot tested using a sample of 248 Canadians aged 18–25 via an online system. Participants identified as East and South East Asian (27.8%), South Asian (17.7%) and Black (13.7%). The majority were 1st (33.5%) or 2nd generation immigrants (52.0%). After redundant items were eliminated, exploratory factor analysis grouped items into domains, and, for each domain, internal consistency, and convergent validity with immigrant generation then age at immigration estimated. A subset of participants re-completed the questionnaire for reliability estimation. Results: The literature review yielded 117 articles that used 13 questionnaires with a total of 440 questions. The Delphi process reduced these to 32 questions. Pilot testing occurred in 248 Canadians aged 18–25. Following item reduction, 16 questions in three domains remained: dominant culture, heritage language, and heritage culture. All had good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alphas > .75). The mean dominant domain score increased with immigrant generation (1st generation: 3.69 (95% CI: 3.49–3.89), 2nd: 4.13 (4.00–4.26), 3rd: 4.40 (4.19– 4.61)), and mean heritage language score was higher among those who immigrated after age 12 than before (p = .0001), indicative of convergent validity. Conclusions: This Bicultural Youth Acculturation Questionnaire has demonstrated validity. It can be incorporated into population health surveys to elucidate the impact of acculturation on health outcomes among bicultural youth.

HEPESE is a longitudinal cohort study of 3,050 non-institutionalized Mexican Americans aged 65 years at baseline (1993–1994) from 5 Southwestern states. Diabetes incidence was ascertained in 4 follow-up surveys to 2004–05 by respondent self-reported physician-diagnosis of diabetes, high blood glucose, or sugar in the urine. Language of interview, immigrant generation, gender, age, education, family history of diabetes, smoking status, alcohol use, health insurance type and self-reported height and weight were assessed. High socioeconomic status (SES) was defined by high school graduation and non-Medicaid insurance. Cox’s proportional hazards models were fit to evaluate the effects of language acculturation, generation and SES on incident diabetes. 845 of 3,050 (27.7 %) Mexican Americans had diabetes at baseline and were younger, more educated, and more likely to have health insurance than those without diabetes. Risk of developing diabetes increased for Spanish-speaking respondents with low SES from 1st to 3rd generation (HR = 1.76, 95 % CI = 1.02–3.03) and from 2nd to 3rd generation (HR = 2.15, 95 % CI = 1.20–3.84). Among English-speaking, high SES participants, generation had a protective effect on developing diabetes: HR = 0.45 (95 % CI = 0.22–0.91) when comparing 3rd versus 1st generation.

The goal of the present article was to determine which model best describes the relation between participating in a new culture and identification with it. In Study 1, Latin American immigrants (N = 146) answered a questionnaire, and the fit of each of the three models was compared using path analyses. Results showed that the best fitting model was one where participation in the new culture positively predicted identification with it. These results were confirmed in Study 2, where semistructured interviews of 15 immigrants were analyzed. The two studies in the present article help us understand the relation between participation in the new culture and identification as well as the scope of the changes brought on by immigration.

We address this concern by examining the links between acculturation preferences, perceived discrimination, and migrants’ transnational political involvement in their country of origin. In line with collective action research, a cross-sectional questionnaire study (N =84) among Senegalese migrants in Paris (France) and Geneva (Switzerland) examined three pathways to transnational political involvement (motivations and actual behaviour). Perceived discrimination, the grievances pathway, was positively related to both transnational motivations (but only when desire to adopt the receiving culture was low) and political behaviour in Senegal. Desire to adopt the culture of the receiving society as an acculturation preference, the embeddedness pathway, was also positively linked to transnational motivations and political behaviour. Finally, desire to maintain the culture of origin as an acculturation preference—the collective identification pathway—was unrelated to transnational political involvement. These findings underscore the compatibility of transnational political involvement in countries of origin and adaptation to receiving societies. We discuss the pivotal role of political psychology in bringing together acculturation psychology and transnationalism studies.

We find that Mexican-white and Mexican-black segregation is higher in new Mexican gateways than in established areas and that, for Mexican-immigrant segregation from whites, this heightened level of residential segregation in new destinations can be explained by the high presence of unauthorized Mexican immigrants living there which tends to bolster segregation between the two groups. By contrast, Mexican-immigrant segregation from native-born blacks tends to be lower in areas with larger undocumented populations, a pattern that is especially true in new destinations. Neither of these opposing effects of legal status on Mexican-immigrant segregation can be explained by compositional differences in assimilation (English ability and earnings) between documented and undocumented immigrants nor by structural variation in metropolitan areas, suggesting a unique association between legal status and segregation.

The original MHeC consists of home page with a visible triage system for those requiring urgent help; a online physical and mental health self-report assessment; a results dashboard; a booking and videoconferencing system; and the generation of a personalized well-being plan. Populations who do not speak English and reside in English-speaking countries are less likely to receive mental health care. In Australia, international students have been identified as disadvantaged compared with their peers; have weaker social support networks; and have higher rates of psychological distress. This scenario is acquiring significant relevance as Spanish-speaking migration is rapidly growing in Australia, and the mental health services for culturally and linguistically diverse populations are limited. Having a Spanish version (MHeC-S) of the Mental Health eClinic would greatly benefit these students. Objective: We used participatory design methodologies with users (young people aged 16-30 years, supportive others, and health professionals) to (1) conduct workshops with users to co-design and culturally adapt the MHeC; (2) inform the development of the MHeC-S alpha prototype; (3) test the usability of the MHeC-S alpha prototype; (4) translate, culturally adapt, and face-validate the MHeC-S self-report assessment; and (5) collect information to inform its beta prototype. Methods: A research and development cycle included several participatory design phases: co-design workshops; knowledge translation; language translation and cultural adaptation; and rapid prototyping and user testing of the MHeC-S alpha prototype. Results: We held 2 co-design workshops with 17 users (10 young people, 7 health professionals). A total of 15 participated in the one-on-one user testing sessions (7 young people, 5 health professionals, 3 supportive others). We collected 225 source documents, and thematic analysis resulted in 5 main themes (help-seeking barriers, technology platform, functionality, content, and user interface). A random sample of 106 source documents analyzed by 2 independent raters revealed almost perfect agreement for functionality (kappa = .86; P < .001) and content (kappa = .92; P < .001) and substantial agreement for the user interface (kappa = .785; P < .001). In this random sample, no annotations were coded for help-seeking barriers or the technology platform. Language was identified as the main barrier to getting medical or psychological services, and smartphones were the most-used device to access the internet. Acceptability was adequate for the prototype’s 5 main elements: home page and triage system, self-report assessment, dashboard of results, booking and video visit system, and personalized well-being plan. The data also revealed gaps in the alpha prototype, such as the need for tailored assessment tools and a greater integration with Spanish-speaking services and communities. Spanish-language apps and e-tools, as well as online mental health information, were lacking. Conclusions: Through a research and development process, we co-designed and culturally adapted, developed and user tested, and evaluated the MHeC-S. By translating and culturally adapting the MHeC to Spanish, we aimed to increase accessibility and availability of e-mental health care in the developing world, and assist vulnerable populations that have migrated to English-speaking countries.

Some groups, particularly in Southern Brazil, have retained their original cultural traditions, whilst acquiring elements of the typical local Brazilian cultural identity. This is the first study designed to formally evaluate biculturality in Brazil. Objective: To psychometrically assess and validate the Portuguese version of the Bicultural Scale (BS) in Brazil. Methods: The BS was adapted and translated to Portuguese and tested for the first time in Brazil in a sample of descendants (n = 160) from four immigrant groups and respective locations in Southern Brazil. A series of psychometric tests were conducted in order to examine the validity of the Portuguese version of the BS. Analyses of variance across scores for all subgroups were also conducted. Results: Factor analysis revealed two main factors contributing to most of the variance in scores. The 10 items measuring affiliation with minority cultural characteristics and the typical Brazilian culture yielded Cronbach’s alpha coefficients of 0.69 and 0.78 respectively, whereas the overall Cronbach’s alpha for all 20 items of the BS was 0.67. There was a significant correlation between items related to the typical Brazilian culture and the generation since immigration of research participants (r = 0.23, p = 0.004). The mean time taken to complete the questionnaire was 7.4 minutes. Conclusion: The results indicate that the Portuguese version of the BS is a valid, reliable and easy-to-use instrument to assess biculturality experienced by descendants of immigrants in southern Brazil.

Data (n = 703) were collected among three population-based samples of working-age Vietnamese immigrants, repatriated emigrants and never-migrated Vietnamese nationals. This allows for a decomposition exercise to separate the effects of migration effects from selection effects on body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio (WHR). Immigrants are more likely to be overweight and to have high WHR, relative to both never-leavers and returnees, a pattern reflecting the importance of migration over selection. Among immigrants, coming to the US at a younger age is associated with higher BMI and WHR levels. And longer length of residence in the US is related to higher BMI. While higher Vietnamese language proficiency is related to a lower BMI level, being bilingual (proficient in both English and Vietnamese) is associated with lower risks for being overweight. The distinct pattern of results suggests that more problematic weight status and fat distribution among Vietnamese immigrants relative to Vietnamese nationals are not artifacts of the types of persons choosing to emigrate, but rather are due to acculturation to American diet and lifestyles. While efforts to promote and maintain traditional patterns of diet and lifestyle are likely to help Vietnamese and other immigrants avoid the perils of American patterns, facilitating a bi-cultural orientation is perhaps the most realistic approach for preserving protective features of the culture of origin with regard to body weight and fat distribution.

The analyses identify whether Hispanics marry coethnics, non‐co‐ethnic Hispanics, non‐Hispanic Whites, non‐Hispanic Blacks, or other minorities. The authors highlight variation by race, nativity, and socioeconomic status and reveal that Hispanics living in new immigrant destinations are more likely to intermarry than those living in traditional Hispanic gateways. Indeed, the higher out‐marriage in new destinations disappears when the demographic context of reception is taken into account. The analysis underscores that patterns of marital assimilation among Hispanics are neither monolithic nor expressed uniformly across geographic space.

In Phase 1 we employed questionnaire data from 918 unaccompanied refugees to investigate the effects of demographic information, pre-migration trauma, mental health and acculturation-related factors on their educational aspirations. In Phase 2, data from Identity Status Interviews (ISI) with 29 participants was analyzed to obtain information about vocational identity status distribution and to examine core themes and contextual factors underlying their vocational choices. The findings from Phase 1 showed that none of the theoretically and empirically based included variables had a significant effect on their aspirations. Moreover, the overall regression model was non-significant. We discussed these findings in relation to the strong motivation among unaccompanied minors to create better lives for themselves than they could have in the countries they fled from, irrespective of their traumatic experiences and mental health problems. In Phase 2 the most important themes emerging from the ISIs revolved around age, time, and economics. The remedial education to bridge the pre-flight gap in formal education meant that the unaccompanied refugee youth entered upper secondary school at substantially older ages than their classmates. Their older ages then led them to prioritize economic considerations in making vocational choices, since the support from the Child Welfare Services is discontinued when they reach the age of majority. Consequently, most of them chose short vocational paths toward earning a living, rather than complex roads that led to the realization of their own long-term aspirations. This may have limited the social mobility of unaccompanied refugees.

The social climate can be described by stereotypes of members of the receiving society about immigrant groups, which in turn shape receiving-society members’ behavioral tendencies of support or discrimination. We investigated warmth and competence stereotypes about 17 immigrant groups in Germany. Results showed four clusters of immigrant groups in the two-dimensional space of warmth and competence. Groups who immigrated comparatively recently and from regions of conflict (e.g., the Balkans, Northern Africa) were stereotyped most negatively (moderate warmth, low competence). Across groups, path analysis investigated the socio-structural relations proposed by the stereotype content model and the BIAS map for immigrant groups in the German context. In a pre-registered model all hypothesized paths were significant but model fit was not good. Therefore, an exploratory model included additional paths as well as intercorrelations between exogenous variables and error terms. The modified model showed good fit and partly replicated the relations proposed by the BIAS map. Threat predicted warmth, whereas status predicted competence. Warmth predicted active behavioral tendencies and competence predicted passive behavioral tendencies. Additional paths from status to warmth, threat to competence, as well as from warmth to passive behavioral tendencies and competence to active behavioral tendencies were also significant. Thus, findings support receiving-society members’ active role in the process of integrating immigrant groups into German society. Based on the results, social-psychological approaches to foster immigrant integration are discussed.

However, we show that common group identity can actively involve majority members in this process across five studies. Study 1 showed that common identity positively predicted support of integration efforts; Studies 2 and 3 extended these findings, showing that it also predicted real behavior such as monetary donations and volunteering. A decrease in modern racism mediated the relations across these studies, and Studies 4 and 5 further demonstrated that it indeed mediated these effects over and above acculturation expectations and color-blindness, which somewhat compromised integration efforts. Moreover, the last two studies also demonstrated that common, but not dual, groups motivated integration efforts. Common identity appears crucial for securing majorities’ altruistic efforts to integrate immigrants and, thus, for achieving functional multiculturalism.

Yet, the role of environmental factors in modifying the effect of acculturation on health behaviours has received little attention. This study aims to create a more nuanced understanding of the health effects of acculturation by examining how neighbourhood immigrant composition modifies the association between individuals' eating patterns and acculturation. Methods: Cross-sectional Data from Los Angeles County Health Survey 2007 adult sample were linked to data on retail food establishments and US Census 2000 neighbourhood characteristics. Acculturation was measured by language spoken at home and years stayed in the US. Eating fast food more than once per week and eating zero serving of fruit or vegetables during the previous day were used as proxy indicators for unhealthy dietary behaviour. Multilevel logistic regression models were performed in the full sample and in the sample with only Latino adults. Results: Immigrants' lack of acculturation and living in a neighbourhood with a high percentage immigrants were associated with healthier dietary behaviour. We also identified that lack of acculturation conveyed a significantly stronger protective effect on regular fast-food consumption for immigrants living in neighbourhoods with higher percentage immigrants (OR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.93). Conclusions: Among immigrants in Los Angeles County, living in a neighbourhood with a high density of other immigrants attenuates the negative effects of acculturation on healthy eating behaviours. Healthy eating promotion efforts should build on this protective effect in outreach to acculturating immigrant communities.

The question of how the native population experiences these developments is of prime importance for intercultural relations and sets the base for acculturation of immigrants. Drawing on attachment and multiculturalism research, we supposed here that general and specific feelings of security might be related to more positive attitudes toward cultural diversity, whereas feelings of threat might be related to less openness. More precisely, the present study investigated how natives’ general attachment (secure or fearful) as well as their specific feelings of (cultural or economic) security might be related to their expectations about acculturation of immigrants in the multicultural context of Luxembourg. The sample included N = 134 Luxembourg nationals with an average age of M = 45.02 (SD = 17.41) who filled out an online questionnaire. Results revealed that self-reported fearful general attachment was positively related to more unwelcoming acculturation orientations. Relations between general attachment and acculturation orientations were mediated by feelings of cultural security, which had strong effects on host nationals’ (un)welcoming acculturation orientations over and above general attachment. Findings suggest that (un)welcoming orientations toward immigrants, entailing openness for cultural contact and exchange, are related to feelings of cultural and economic security which are partly biased by a general secure or fearful attachment. Feelings of security seem thus to provide a secure base for tolerance and openness to cultural diversity which are needed in order to deal successfully with the challenges of today’s multicultural societies.

"1339","Search2021","thesis",2021,"Yeung, Shirley Ceensem","Welcome work: Hospitality and the mediation of migrant mobility in Swiss integration policy.",1,NA,"Since 2005, Switzerland's federal Integration policy has structured the social inclusion of (im)migrants in the country; legal settlement, access to social aid, and naturalization itself are contingent on discretionary judgments as to whether a migrant is linguistically and culturally 'integrated' into Swiss society. While public and policy discourse frame the concept of 'integration' as a more inclusive departure from Switzerland's historically 'assimilationist' migration policy, discussion has too often overlooked how the shifting and productively vague notion of 'integration' constitutes a terrain of social practice—one where the tense, mutually constitutive relationship between reception and regulation, ethics and politics, is negotiated by a host of mobility mediators. Positioned in between migrant and citizen, these persons, often humanitarian volunteers (bénévoles) and 'migrants' themselves, teach and broker the cultural-linguistic competences of integration while bridging, too, the ethical and economic dimensions of cross-border mobility.This dissertation draws on 14 months of ethnographic research, conducted in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, among volunteer workers, French language teachers, and undocumented persons distributed across a network of migrant aid agencies, NGOs, and centers of migrant-education in Geneva. The dissertation asks: How is the concept of 'integration' in Geneva constructed and practiced? How does its practice enable or foreclose migrant legality? How do situated mediators broker migrants' economic and social mobility through acts of teaching and linguistic-cultural socialization? What forms of hospitality or solidarity do these envisage? And, in particular, what semiotic processes render the differences—the categories of mobility, person, and (in)hospitable practice—by which integration is imagined and performed? In analyzing everyday practices of migrant socialization, this dissertation advances the concept of 'welcome work'—the forms of ethically-charged interstitial brokerage and mediation that aim to articulate migrant with state and citizen. Exploring the ironies and ambivalences of Swiss Integration policy, the dissertation chapters track varied scales and terrains of (in)hospitality: the social and policy distinctions between various types of national strangers/guests (and their relationship to the state's integration criteria); the moral-economic imagination of the French language in night classes for precarious migrant job-seekers; the cultivation of migrants' aesthetic sensibilities via pedagogies of 'culture'; and practices of legal mediation by which migrant legality, presence, and Swiss jurisdiction itself are brokered and made. By examining the work of intermediaries on the integration front-line, this dissertation contributes to scholarship on mobility and migration by attending to the interstitial spaces of reception—the space between migrant and state that allows for their articulation to become conceivable in terms of 'guest' and 'host.' In this space, 'welcome work' becomes a salient terrain where mediators and migrants alike attempt to reconcile hospitable aspirations and ethics with a national politics of crisis management and border closure.

Therefore, the present quantitative study investigated the variance in attitudes toward seeking psychological help as predicted by degree of acculturation, severity of self-reported problems, and beliefs about the cause of mental health problems among West African immigrants in the U.S. The following research questions and hypothesis were addressed: What are the specific mental and physical health concerns of West African immigrants in the U.S.? Where do West African immigrants with mental health problems seek help? The hypothesis was that higher acculturation into the U.S. society, severity of self-reported problems, and interactional attribution beliefs about mental health problems would be significant predictors of attitudes toward seeking psychological help. Approximately 600 questionnaires were mailed to first generation West African immigrants. A total of 126 surveys were received representing a return rate of 21%. Of this number 15 were not usable. Analyses were based on the remaining 111 surveys. Each survey packet included a demographic questionnaire, a referral list for national mental health, counseling and crisis services, a business reply envelope, and a battery of 4 instruments including the Attitude Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help Scale (ATSPPH), Behavioral Acculturation Scale (BAS), Brief Symptoms Inventory (BSI), and the Mental Health Locus of Origin Scale (MHLO). Descriptive statistics were computed (percentages & frequencies) to answer the first and second research questions. In addition, one multiple regression, using forced entry method was performed to predict West African immigrants‘ attitudes toward seeking psychological help as measured by the total scores on the ATSPPH, using the BAS, BSI, and MHLO scores as predictors. Finally, Pearson product moment correlation analyses were performed among the variables in examining the regression results. The results identified interactional attribution beliefs about mental health problems as the only significant predictor. West African immigrants reported various concerns with their mental and physical health. In general, they reported preference for the use of informal systems of support to resolve their emotional concerns and the use of medical doctors for physical concerns.

Different levels of concordance of acculturation attitudes were induced by presenting participants with newspaper articles describing the acculturation attitude of the respective out-group and perceived threat was measured.

Vol. 1.",NA,NA,"This thesis is concerned with how multiple identities are perceived to interrelate and the functions they may serve for the individual in the context of stability, change and identity threat. The research focuses on the interrelationship between national and religious identities in Greece. It drew on Identity Process Theory (Breakwell, 1986), Roccas and Brewer's Social Complexity Model (2002) and the work of Kay Deaux (1993; Deaux, Reid, Mizrahi and Ethier, 1995) to investigate three ways that identities might interrelate: structure, content and motivations. Using self-completed questionnaires with some open-ended measures, and 7 semistructured interviews, Study 1 investigated the relationship between the strength of identification, centrality and content of national and religious identity elements. The sample consisted of 107 adult Greeks. Strong relationships were found between the levels of identification and centrality of the two identity elements as well as a large overlap in terms of content, both at an individual and the social representational level. In Study 2, a repeated-measures experimental design was used to investigate the relationship between the two identity elements before and after threat was induced in the principles of national distinctiveness and continuity. The sample consisted of 258 Greek students. It was shown that although the level of identification with each of the national and religious identities is predicted by their respective motivations, the same motivational principles (continuity and self-esteem) predicted levels of identification with the two identities. Furthermore, the motivational principles relating to each of the identity elements were strongly related to each other. Threat to national identity did not only affect the relative contribution that national identity made to the maintenance of the motivational principles but also affected the relative contribution made by the religious identity. Religious identification increased after threat, but most importantly, the relative contribution of its motivational principles changed as a response to the particular type of identity threat induced in the national identity. Study 3 examined the extent to which levels of perceived overlap between national and religious identity elements influence Greek nationals' acculturation preferences from the state and the immigrant/minority groups contextualised also for different domains (citizenship, education and intermarriage) and for different target groups (Albanians, Russian and Greek Moslems of Thrace). It obtained questionnaire data from 316 Greek adults. The results showed that levels of perceived overlap between the two identity elements, was strongly and positively associated with perceived threat to national identity and prejudice and affected differently the levels of endorsement of host majority acculturation in relation to the immigrant/groups and the state. The findings of the thesis are discussed in relation to how the relationships between multiple identities could be usefully conceptualised and how they may be used by individuals as coping strategies under the context of change and/or threat. It is also argued that inter-group perceptions can be better explained by taking into account multiple identities rather than the relative salience of single identities at a particular time.

Help-seeking in response to teen dating violence among Latinos.",0,"not acculturation","Objective: Though Latinos are the largest minority in the United States, they are not well represented in teen dating violence research. The current study fills this gap by using a national sample of Latino teens to examine 1) rates of formal and informal help-seeking among Latino teens who experienced dating violence, 2) reasons for not seeking help, and 3) cultural predictors of help-seeking (i.e., immigrant status, acculturation, and familism). Method: Data came from the Dating Violence among Latino Adolescents (DAVILA) study that surveyed 1,525 Latino teens and their caregivers across the United States, 6.2% (n = 95) of which experienced specific forms of physical, sexual and/or stalking dating violence. Telephone interviews were conducted with caregivers and their 12- to 18-year-old Latino teens. Results: Sixty-one percent of victims sought informal help (most commonly from friends) and 16% sought formal help (most commonly from school personnel). The most common reason for not seeking help was 'I didn’t think of it.' Logistic regression analyses revealed that girls and those with higher scores on familism were more likely to seek formal help. Conclusions: Efforts to prevent dating violence and/or intervene in dating violence relationships need further development, including addressing the gendered nature of help-seeking, addressing barriers to services when needed, and building on strengths such as familism and positive social networks.

In our study, we explored whether acculturation and dyadic mutuality, as perceived by Mexican American family caregivers, explain the caregivers’ expectations of family loyalty toward elderly relatives. Design: A nonexperimental, correlational design with convenience sampling was used in El Paso, Texas, from October 2007 to January 2008. Methods: Three bilingual promotoras collected data from 193 Mexican American adult caregivers of community‐dwelling elders using three scales designed for Mexican Americans: the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans II‐Short Form, the Mutuality Scale, and the Expectations of Family Loyalty of Children Toward Elderly Relatives Scale. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to analyze the data. Findings: Acculturation had a marginal effect (r = .21, p < .05), but mutuality presented a strong correlation (r = .45, p < .001) with the expectations of family loyalty toward elderly relatives. There was no significant correlation between acculturation and mutuality (r = .05). Conclusions: Although Mexican American caregivers with strong Mexican orientation may have high expectations of family loyalty toward elderly relatives, mutuality exhibits more significant effects on expectations. Among Mexican Americans, mutuality between the caregiving dyad, as perceived by caregivers, may be a better predictor of filial values than caregivers’ acculturation alone. Clinical Relevance: It may be useful to incorporate the dual paradigm of acculturation and mutuality into immigrant family care for elderly relatives.

The role of perceived identification with the host nation.",0,"not migrant","Research has shown that members of the national majority group generally consider host culture adoption by immigrants as desirable. However, so far, this positive effect of perceived host culture adoption on attitudes toward immigrants has not been explained. We argue that majority members infer national identification of immigrants from their cultural adoption. Moreover, we predict that this inference should decrease majority members’ feeling of ingroup threat, therefore also improving their attitudes toward immigrants. We conducted two experimental studies. In Study 1, majority members who were presented an immigrant group that adopted the host culture held more positive attitudes than those who were presented one that disregarded it. In line with our hypothesis, this effect was fully mediated by perceived identification of the immigrants with the host nation, itself decreasing perception of ingroup threat. Study 2 reproduced the same experimental design, but used descriptions of individual immigrants’ acculturation strategies, and the immigrant group’s status—valued vs. devalued origin—was also manipulated. In addition, Study 2 focused on dimensions of the 'Big Two' of social perception. Results replicated the mediational effect of perceived identification on attribution of both warmth and competence traits. The status manipulation had no significant effect and did not interact with cultural adoption. These two studies provide robust evidence that perception of host nation identification explains the effects of perceived cultural adoption on attitudes towards immigrants.

Prior research suggested that the attachment patterns or attachment styles influence the way immigrants cope with the process of immigration. This study investigated the effects of attachment patterns on the level of acculturation and attachment relationship among immigrant Asian Indian mothers and their U.S.-raised daughters. In this study, Asian Indian mothers and their daughters responded to the Suinn-Lew Acculturation Scale (SL-ASIA, 1992) modified for the Asian Indian population, Relationship Questionnaire (RQ, Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991), Relationship Scale Questionnaire (RSQ, Griffin & Bartholomew, 1994), Intimacy Scale (Walker & Thompson, 1983), Conflict Scale (Boyd, 1987), and a background information questionnaire. Statistically significant correlations were found between intergenerational transmission of attachment patterns among mothers and daughters and their levels of intimacy and conflict with each other. Nearly two thirds of secure mothers had secure daughters. Similarly, approximately two thirds of insecure mothers had insecure daughters. Secure mothers and daughters reported more intimacy and less conflict while insecure mothers and daughters reported less intimacy and more conflict in their relationship with each other. No significant statistical correlation was found between attachment patterns and levels of acculturation of either mothers or daughters. However, several socio-demographic variables were found to be significantly correlated to attachment patterns and acculturation levels of both mothers and daughters.

Drawing from scholarship on anti-Mexican and anti-immigrant rhetoric found readily in various media and scholarship on emotions, we tested four hypotheses. Hypotheses 1 and 2 predicted that positive and negative political rhetoric would increase and decrease positive and negative emotions, respectively. Hypotheses 3 and 4 then predicted that emotional responses to positive or negative political rhetoric would influence perceived stress, subjective health, and subjective well-being. Data collection occurred between August 2016 and June 2017 at a university in California. A sample of 280 Mexican-origin youth, defined broadly as having at least one ancestor born in Mexico or the participant themselves born in Mexico, participated in an experiment where they were randomly assigned to one of three study conditions: viewing (1) positive or (2) negative political rhetoric about immigrants and Latinos in general, or (3) neutral rhetoric as a control condition before providing qualitative responses to open-ended questions and completing measures of positive and negative affect, perceived stress, subjective health, and subjective well-being. Qualitative responses indicated that negative and positive political rhetoric elicited a range of negative emotions and positive emotions, respectively. Quantitative analysis with independent samples t-tests, ANOVA, and linear regression models found that negative political rhetoric elicited higher negative affect than positive and neutral rhetoric, and positive rhetoric elicited higher positive affect than negative and neutral rhetoric. Negative emotional responses, in turn, were associated with participants’ higher perceived stress, lower subjective health and lower subjective well-being. Conversely, positive emotional responses were associated with lower perceived stress, higher subjective health, and higher subjective well-being. Positive political rhetoric, by eliciting positive emotions, can have a salubrious effect. Altogether, these findings suggest that political rhetoric matters for the targets of that rhetoric.

This study examined the association of ethnic drinking culture, acculturation, and enculturation with alcohol drinking among male immigrants in Taiwan. This cross-sectional survey recruited 188 male immigrants. Ethnic drinking culture was divided into dry and wet according to per capita alcohol consumption and abstinent rate in the countries of origin in reference to that in Taiwan. A scale, Bidimensional Acculturation Scale for Marriage-Based Immigrants, was developed to measure acculturation (adaptation to the host culture) and enculturation (maintenance of the original culture). Drinking patterns (abstinent, low-risk drinking, and hazardous drinking) were determined by scores on the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test. There was a significant interaction between ethnic drinking culture and enculturation/acculturation on drinking patterns. Multinomial logistic regression models identified that for those from dry ethnic drinking cultures, a high level of acculturation was associated with increased low-risk drinking, while a high level of enculturation was associated with decreased low-risk drinking. For those from wet ethnic drinking cultures, a low level of acculturation and high level of enculturation were associated with increased hazardous drinking. High family socioeconomic status was associated with increased drinking, while perceived insufficient family income was positively associated with hazardous use. To prevent hazardous use of alcohol, health education should be targeted at immigrant men who drink, especially among those who have economic problems, are from wet ethnic drinking cultures, and demonstrate low adaptation to the host culture.

To explore these diverse Latina/o adolescent experiences this dissertation cross-culturally compares patterns of ethnic identity and acculturation across a group of Indigenous (Yucatec Maya) immigrant Latino/a adolescents in the U.S. with Yucatec Maya adolescents residing in Mexico and with non-Indigenous immigrant Latina/o adolescents in the U.S.How do ethnic identity, acculturation levels, perceived discrimination, and sense of school belonging compare across Yucatec Maya adolescents in the U.S., non-Yucatec Maya Latina/o adolescents in the U.S., and Yucatec Maya adolescents still in Mexico? What roles do individual factors such as gender, language, generation level, and external factors such as family, cultural practices, ethnic community networks, and peer relationships take in the adolescents' lives in the U.S. and in Yucatan? The study draws on ethnic identity and acculturation frameworks as they relate to perceived discrimination (the study of how the person targeted by discrimination reacts and interprets these acts) and to the adolescents' feelings of belonging at school. The participants included 65 Latina/o non-Yucatec Maya heritage adolescents living in the Los Angeles, California area, 66 Mexican Maya heritage immigrant adolescents living in San Francisco, California or the Los Angeles, California area, and 70 Mexican Maya heritage adolescents living in Yucatan, Mexico. All 201 adolescents took a survey incorporating measures of ethnic identity, acculturation, perceived discrimination, and school belonging. Thirty-eight of the adolescents participated in semi-structured interviews that explored attitudes toward school, culture, discrimination, family, community, and peers influencing the adolescents.Quantitative findings expose the intra-group differences across Yucatec Maya and non-Yucatec Maya Latina/os adolescents and the discrimination faced by the growing population of Yucatec Maya adolescents within the Latino/a immigrant groups. Language, gender, and generation all play roles in the amount of peer and adult perceived discrimination experienced and the distress caused by perceived discrimination across Indigenous and non-Indigenous adolescents. The quantitative findings ultimately show that Indigenous adolescents have different psychological and cultural experiences when compared to non-Indigenous Latina/o adolescents. Being Yucatec Maya, first generation, male, and/or knowledgeable of Maya would put the adolescent at a higher risk of experiencing more perceived discrimination acts and distress. More perceived discrimination from adults also relates to adolescents in the U.S. (both Yucatec Maya and non-Yucatec Maya) resulting in lower levels of school belonging.The qualitative findings across the non-Yucatec Maya adolescents, Yucatec Maya adolescents in the U.S., and Yucatec Maya adolescents in Mexico reveal an in depth look at multiple perspectives surrounding cultural and ethnic identity, cultural practices, American culture, discrimination, school, family, and peers. Specifically for the Yucatec Maya adolescents, the interviews provided a lens into their sentiments about the Maya culture and preserving the culture for future generations. The interviews reflect the agency, reclamation of culture, and lived experiences that make up the Indigenous and non-Indigenous adolescents of this study. The study exposes the Yucatec Maya youth's resilient Indigenous identity that emerges regardless of the discrimination they face from non-Latina/o/non-Mexican groups as well as from their own Latina/o/Mexican communities. This understanding is needed to provide more comprehensive resources and services to these adolescents.

This study examines the impact of acculturation, measured as English ability, along with other predictors on health for older Asian Americans. Data Sources: Data from the 2009 American Community Survey and the National Latino and Asian American Study were used to examine large-scale population characteristics of Asian American elderly. Measures: A broad view of health (physical, mental, Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (iADLs)) was examined using items capturing functional disability. Psychological health was examined using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Analytical Methods: Confirmatory factor analysis, logistic regression analysis, and path analysis was conducted. Results: CFA suggests scales are reliable for use. Cross-cultural comparability was found for psychological distress, but not for functional disability. Results indicated that English ability predicted lower disability, but had no relationship to psychological distress. Higher levels of intergenerational family conflict increased distress for Asian elders. Perceived discrimination, which represents a form of social marginalization, emerged as a key mediating variable and was consistently associated with poorer mental health. Conclusion: This study provided key insights into the applicability and measurement invariance of two key measures of health for older Asian Americans. While the measures captured health reasonably well, the results suggest confounds for this population, which may be due to perceptions of disability, language, immigration status, social networks, health insurance status, and access to services. Acculturation is a process involving the individual and the family, and can cut across age groups and generations. Policies should emphasize the development of culturally-specific services for Asian American elders. The study highlights that social workers must engage families across generations and the lifespan when working with Asian elders.

However, measures of degree of adjustment do not capture the breadth of strategies expatriates may use to achieve such adjustment, which may be critical for understanding whether expatriates have achieved a healthy and productive orientation to life abroad. Borrowing from research on immigrant populations, this study examines the construct of expatriate acculturation strategies, which characterize expatriates' mode of adjustment along two independent dimensions reflecting maintenance of one's home culture and engagement of the host culture, respectively. One hundred U.S. expatriates were recruited and completed an index of acculturation strategies. In addition, participants completed survey and reaction-time based measures of proposed antecedents, correlates, and outcomes of varying acculturation strategies. Results suggest that expatriates largely pursue either a maintenance-focused or engagement-focused strategy and that acculturation strategies are not redundant with degree of adjustment. Relationships between acculturation strategies and relevant individual differences, characteristics of expatriate positions, and outcomes are discussed.

Results for Study 1 indicated a three-factor structure of nation attachment; the factors were labelled secure-preoccupied, fearful, and dismissive nation attachment.

Secure-preoccupied nation attachment was a significant predictor of increased heritage culture identification for participants residing in their country of birth, whilst dismissive nation attachment was a significant predictor of decreased heritage culture identification for international migrants. Secure-preoccupied nation attachment was also associated with higher levels of subjective-wellbeing. Study 2 further confirmed the validity of the nation attachment construct through confirmatory factor analysis; the three-factor model adequately fit the data. Similar to the results of Study 1, secure-preoccupied nation attachment was associated with increased levels of heritage culture identification and psychological well-being.

Research indicates social integration and social isolation are related to health, and Latino day laborers (LDLs) tend to be socially isolated and, thus, at high risk for adverse health consequences. relationships among social isolation, social integration, self-rated health (SRH), and demographics were examined in a sample of LDLs to contribute to the literature on social networks and health in this and other migrant populations. Design. We analyzed data from 324 LDLs who participated in Proyecto SHILOS (Salud del Hombre Inmigrante Latino), a Houston-based survey of Latino immigrant men’s health. Based on the literature, we hypothesized SRH would be (1) positively associated with social integration and (2) negatively associated with social isolation. All proposed measures were first entered into a correlation matrix to identify significant bivariate relationships (p ≤ .05, two-tailed). Associations between variables that were directly correlated with SRH and variables that were, in turn, proximally associated with these variables were then used to develop a structural equation path model of SRH. Individual paths in the model were measured for significance, and goodness of fit was assessed by the model chi-square, the Comparative Fit Index, and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation. Results. Inconsistent with the first hypothesis, SRH was negatively associated with social integration, as measured by the number of trusted friends. Consistent with the second hypothesis, SRH was negatively associated with social isolation, as measured by needing someone to talk to. More frequent contact with family was also negatively associated with social isolation. Discussion. Our findings suggest social integration may not always protect and promote health. Therefore, assessing the quality of LDLs’ different relationships, not just the quantity, is vital. Future studies should further analyze the effects that social resources have on perceptions of social isolation and health in LDLs and other migrant populations.

The study sample comprised 248 Turkish migrant women (mean age: 34.38; SD: 7.6) living in London. Self-report questionnaires were used to assess empowerment, social support, acculturation attitude and psychological distress. The study hypothesized that perceived discrimination; acculturation attitudes of separation, assimilation and marginalization; and psychological distress would be negative predictors of empowerment and that social support and an integration acculturation attitude would be positive predictors of empowerment. To some extent, the study findings supported this hypothesis. Hierarchical regression analysis indicated psychological distress to be the most significant predictor of empowerment, with other significant predictors including level of education and social support. More specifically, lower levels of psychological distress and higher levels of education and social support appeared to predict greater empowerment. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that level of education and social support may function as protective factors and that psychological distress may function as a risk factor for empowerment in the migration context.

Methods: A community-based participatory research framework was used through all phases of this study. Standard as well as community-developed measures of acculturation were used. Data were obtained by face-to-face and telephone interviews with 1,628 respondents from July 2006 to March 2007. Results: Vietnamese and Cambodian men smoke at higher rates than men in the U.S. general population (35% and 58% compared with 20%, respectively). Most men across the Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Lao populations started smoking prior to immigration to the United States, although most former smokers quit smoking after immigration to the United States. Most male Hmong respondents started smoking after immigration. Education was predictive of smoking status across genders, with less education associated with greater odds of being a smoker. Logistic regression found some acculturation measures to be predictive of smoking status across both genders: Less acculturated male respondents and more acculturated female respondents are more likely to be smokers. Discussion: Results of this study suggest that the role of acculturation in tobacco use may not be straightforward as has been presented previously. Other factors, such as social norms and cultural or linguistic isolation, may also be playing a role in tobacco use patterns and may play different roles for different subgroups. Further research is needed within each population and subgroups within those populations to understand these relationships and how they affect smoking behavior.

It also tested the mediating role of the dominant group's tolerance towards different cultural groups and the non-dominant group's perceived discrimination. Two community samples were recruited, including Hong Kong residents (N = 181) and immigrants from Mainland China (N = 182). Among Mainland immigrants, the integration strategy predicted both psychological adaptation and sociocultural adaptation. Multicultural ideology predicted psychological adaptation and played a significant role in intercultural contact with Hong Kong people through the mediation of lower perceived discrimination. Among Hong Kong residents, the integration expectation predicted psychological adaptation. Multicultural ideology indirectly affected intercultural contact with Mainland immigrants through the mediation of greater tolerance. These results suggest that the integration strategy and expectation are more important to intrapersonal functioning, whereas multicultural ideology may be more crucial in facilitating social interactions between members of the society of settlement and immigrants in culturally plural milieus. Future research should test the proposed models of dominant and non-dominant groups in other cultures.

The present study had three sub-hypotheses. The first proposed that participant's who had experienced negative psychological distress/family dysfunction, were more likely to major in Psychology than Criminology. The second sub-hypothesis proposed that Latino men were more likely to choose Criminology, whereas Latino women were more likely to choose psychology due to their increased ability to demonstrate empathy and listening skills. The third sub-hypothesis proposed that participants with an internal locus of control were more likely to enter a psychology degree than a criminology degree. The recruitment included a total of 228 participants. Fifty-five percent of participants were recruited from the Psychology Department at the state university, and the remaining participants were recruited from several programs that support Hispanic and Latino students and/or migrant students. Participants were asked to complete a Demographic Questionnaire, the Bidimensional Acculturation Scale for Hispanics (BAS), the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), the Multi-Dimensional Emotional Empathy Scale, and the Locus of Control Scale. A logistic regression analysis revealed that acculturation and empathy were best predictors of predictive of major choices. Overall, bicultural students are 4.4 times more likely than acculturated students to be Criminology majors. Furthermore, lower empathy scores are significantly associated with a criminology career choice over psychology. For each one unit decrease in empathy score, the likelihood of choosing Criminology major is 5.37 times higher than choosing a Psychology major. Psychological/family distress, gender, and locus of control were hypothesized to be predictors of career choice, but did not significantly contribute to the logistic regression model.

Most of the respondents reported either no changes (82%) or positive changes (18%) in their perceived health status after immigration. The results of the multiple logistic regression analyses indicated healthy dietary behavior was related to positive changes in the perceived health status of both groups (odds ratio [OR] = 7.4 for Han Chinese; OR = 14.6 for Korean-Chinese). Among Han Chinese women, the length of residence in Korea and the change in perceived health status showed a negative relation (OR = 0.2). In contrast, their level of acculturation and health perception were positive (OR = 7.5). However, these results did not apply to the Korean-Chinese women. In conclusion, factors related to changes in perceived health status differed between the 2 groups although they shared healthy dietary behaviors as a common factor. Therefore, policies and programs aimed at promoting immigrant women’s health should consider the differences between Han Chinese and Korean-Chinese.

In the current research, we test the prediction that high-quality interactions with majority others, in which minorities feel accepted, increase the likelihood of emotional fit. We also explore whether this prediction holds true for both positive and negative interactions with majority. To test this prediction, we conducted a 7-day daily diary study with minority students in Belgian middle schools (N = 117). Each day, participants reported one positive and one negative interaction at school. They subsequently evaluated each interaction (e.g., felt accepted), assessed their relationship with the interaction partner (e.g., our relationship is important to me), and rated their emotions. Analyses focused on the interactions with Belgian majority interaction partners. Emotional acculturation was computed for positive and negative interactions separately, by calculating the fit between the emotional pattern of the minority student and the average emotional pattern of a sample of majority participants (N = 106) who also took part in the daily diary. As predicted, we found higher emotional fit in positive interactions when immigrant minorities felt accepted by the interaction partner. In contrast to this finding for positive interactions, emotional fit for negative interactions was higher when minorities felt excluded by the interaction partner. Further analyses on the negative interactions suggested that minority adolescents felt more negative autonomy-promoting emotions (e.g., anger and frustration) when they perceived being excluded. Given that Belgian majority youth feel more autonomy-promoting emotions generally, minorities’ fit with majority patterns was higher. The results confirm our hypothesis that minorities’ fit with majority emotions is contingent on the quality of their interactions with majority, even if in negative interactions, high-quality interactions produced less rather than more emotional fit. Our findings suggest that emotional acculturation is not just a ‘skill’ that minority individuals acquire, but also a response to the ways in which interactions with majority others develop. Inclusive interactions, especially when they are positive, appear to align immigrant minority individuals with the majority norm.

She is faced with the daunting need to relocate self in a new cultural space. Re-establishing a life after the crisis often means resettlement in a new home country where smooth resettlement often hinges on the refugee's ability to rebuild her social network in the host culture. The purpose of this study is to describe the social architecture of female refugee identity. A multiple case study of seventeen (N =17) female refugees, representing 135 relational ties, is used to explore the composition of refugee social networks from 14 different countries in order to understand intercultural identity from a socio-structural perspective. The study demonstrates that refugees occupy a relationally thin identity space; commonly that means a high-density, low-heterogeneity, small network that leaves very little flexibility for new identity formation. The mean network heterogeneity across all cases was 0.27, indicating a low presence of host nationals in the networks. Working from their stories of liminality and the search for communitas, the study provides insight into the variability within social architectures for refugee identity and the particular acculturation narratives represented within a socio-structural space of redefinition. The study furthers our understanding of the interconnections between structural properties and communicative properties of identity formation through the depiction of female refugee-immigrant ethno-graphs.

Because the Philippines is the second largest source of immigrants to the United States, studying Filipinos' processes of acculturation is important as acculturation can result in Filipinos experiencing intergenerational conflict, marital discord, adjustment disorders, racism, and shifts in traditional gender roles. Because female ethnic minorities are doubly stigmatized for their race as well as their gender, this study investigated aspects of the Filipina experience. More precisely, Filipinas' level of acculturation was examined in relation to their attitudes toward women's gender roles. One hundred twenty-one Filipinas from the San Francisco Bay Area completed a demographic questionnaire, the Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identity Acculturation Scale (SL-ASIA) that measures behavioral acculturation, the Asian Values Scale (AVS) that measures adherence to Asian values, the Sex Role Orientation Scale (SRO) that measures attitudes toward women's roles, and 2 open-ended questions. Hypotheses were tested using Pearson's r correlations and a stepwise regression. Results indicated that adherence to Asian values and participants' age at immigration to the United States were significant predictors of attitudes toward women's roles. Both behavioral acculturation and adherence to Asian values were significantly correlated with attitudes toward women's roles. In addition, participants who were more behaviorally acculturated were significantly less likely to adhere to Asian values. Furthermore, participants were significantly more likely to have nontraditional attitudes toward women's roles if they had high incomes, were more educated, spoke more English at home, and were born in the United States.

This cross-sectional, survey study focused on the role of social capital and acculturation to American society on flourishing among the purposive sample of Japanese immigrants and sojourners living in Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, USA. A total of 380 cases were used to test the hypothetical model of flourishing through structural equation modeling. The majority of the participants was female, in their 30s and 40s, married, fairly high socioeconomic status, and employed. The average lengths of stay in the United States were almost 10 years. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that all the measurement models of flourishing, social capital, and acculturation to American society were reliable and valid with no or a few modifications. The MIMIC model was not included in the final model because of its poor fit (the CFI = .887, the TLI = .830, the RMSEA = .143, χ2 = 122.28, df = 14, p < .05). The final full structural model yielded an adequate fit (the CFI = .921, the TLI = .906, the RMSEA = .067, χ2 = 345.48, df = 128, p < .05). Among the sample of Japanese immigrants, demographic variables, including gender, English proficiency, and lengths of stay in the United States were not associated with flourishing. Those with higher social capital were more likely to experience higher acculturation to American society (β = .531, p < .05) as well as flourishing (β = .494, p < .05). Higher acculturation to American society predicted higher flourishing (β = .264, p < .05). The intervening effect of acculturation was found in the relationship between social capital and flourishing. That is, those with higher social capital were more likely to be acculturated to American society, in turn, experienced higher flourishing. The positive approach is useful in understanding immigrant and sojourner adaptation because it takes a person-in-environment perspective that values the effect of social interactions on individuals’ optimal wellbeing. The findings of the study yielded several important implications for social workers working with immigrants and sojourners. Social workers can promote wellbeing by helping them strengthen their existing social ties and to create new relationships that are mediated by both face-to-face and online contacts. Expanded social capital will enhance better acculturation to American society, which encourages better flourishing among Japanese immigrants and sojourners. For ever-growing global society, it is of great importance to examine immigration as positive experiences for both immigrants and the nation that welcomes them.

These three means are termed the 'auspices of migration.' By 2006, however, Iceland’s policy of prioritizing workers from the European Economic Area made it nearly impossible for Thais and other non-Europeans to secure a work permit, leading to an increase in marriage-based migrations among this group. The main objective of this dissertation is to examine how the auspices of migration affect host country language skills and economic integration, the power and influence of Thai women in homes shared with Icelandic men, and reciprocal exchange networks between Thais and Icelanders. 858 Thai adults were living in Iceland at the time of the study, including 665 women. Fieldwork among this population took place over a period of 22 months. In my analyses I focus on qualitative interviews with factory workers, participant-observation in the Thai community, and quantitative survey data from a sample of 109 Thai women. Results have shown that women who came to Iceland under the auspices of an employer had the best Icelandic language skills of all three groups of women, and as a result they also had better economic outcomes than those who came by other means. Additionally, employer-sponsored migrants reported belonging to more egalitarian households with less-traditional divisions of labor and more equitable distributions of decision-making power. In contrast, migrants sponsored by an Icelandic spouse reported the highest levels of cross-ethnic exchanges when compared to those who came to Iceland under other auspices. Migrants sponsored by employers were far more likely to be limited to Thais-only in their exchange networks.

Results from a web-based survey.",1,NA,"Background. Due to the fast development of economies in China and the great needs of professionals in the US, the population of highly educated young Chinese professionals working in high-tech industries has grown very fast in both countries. This population was suggested to have risk of consuming high energy and fat diet in both countries. Objectives. This study aimed to investigate the associations of dietary intake with nutrition knowledge, attitude, dietary self-efficacy and acculturation among Chinese working in high-tech industries in China and in the US. Methods. This study was a cross-sectional self-administered online survey. We studied 925 Chinese aged 20-45 years, who worked in high-tech industries and had at least a bachelor degree in four sub-groups: employees of Chinese companies in China; employees of American companies in China; Chinese-born immigrant in the US; and American-born Chinese in the US. A web-based questionnaire including a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was developed to assess total energy and fat intakes, nutrition knowledge, attitudes, dietary self-efficacy. Four domains of acculturation were assessed among Chinese in the US. Using these data, we compared the four sub-groups and tested the prediction model of dietary intake and BMI. Results. Our results showed that American-born Chinese participants consumed significantly higher energy and fat than the other three groups. Participants in the US had higher nutrition knowledge, attitude and self-efficacy than participants in China. Chinese-born immigrant men in the US had the highest nutrition knowledge and attitude and the lowest prevalence of overweight among the four study groups of men. The study results suggested that preferring Chinese food and Chinese leisure activity are predictors of lower energy and fat intake in Chinese-born immigrants. Conclusions. The Chinese-born immigrants showed significant advantages in nutrition knowledge, attitude, and dietary self-efficacy and had the lowest prevalence of overweight in men. American-born Chinese consumed the highest energy and fat among the four study groups even though their nutrition knowledge, attitude and self-efficacy were high. Future nutrition promotion programs should make use of these cultural and environmental differences when designing theses programs. The web-based survey method can be utilized in future nutrition research.

Data were collected via surveys, telephone, and personal-interviews in four major Australian cities. Among other things, the study revealed that Greek identity and cultural customs are often significant to first generation GIs. Adjustment challenges upon entry include primarily language, housing, and transportation difficulties, nostalgia for relatives and the motherland, unfamiliarity with socio-cultural systems, unemployment, money challenges, and lack of friendships. Christian faith, the extended family, family values and traditions, cultural pride for ancient Greek achievements, and a hard ‘work ethic’ are notable resiliencies that support GIs in their struggles and solidify their pursuit for happiness and success. Financial concerns, aging, and nostalgia for relatives and the motherland were the primary causes of socio-emotional instability. Attitudinal differences in the respondents based on age, gender, and socio-economic status, cross-cultural comparisons, and recommendations for culturally-sensitive practice with GIs are analyzed and methodological limitations illuminated.

Few studies, however, have disentangled the effects of immigrants’ arrival cohort from their tenure of U.S. residence, an omission that could produce imprecise estimates of the degree of health decline experienced by Hispanic immigrants as their U.S. tenure increases. Using data from the 1996-to-2014 waves of the March Current Population Survey, we show that the health (i.e., self-rated health) of Hispanic immigrants varies by both arrival cohort and U.S. tenure for immigrants hailing from most of the primary sending countries/regions of Hispanic immigrants. We also find evidence that acculturation plays an important role in determining the health trajectories of Hispanic immigrants. With respect to self-rated health, however, our findings demonstrate that omitting arrival-cohort measures from health assimilation models may result in overestimates of the degree of downward health assimilation experienced by Hispanic immigrants.

Athena's (2000) discussion the English Common Law of 1967 in the context of wife abuse was supported by Stedman's (1917) statement that, 'by the old common law rule the husband had the right to inflict moderate personal chastisement on his wife, provided that he used, as some of his domestic authorities stated it, a switch no longer than his thumb' (p. 1). This study examined the help-seeking behavior of women of Hispanic origin who have been in situations of domestic violence. In particular, it is focused on the perceptions of Mexican immigrant and Mexican American women regarding the social services available to them (Tiefenthaler, Farmer, & Sambira, 2005). It also explored how this help-seeking behavior is affected by their degree of acculturation and the incidence of intimate partner violence. I wanted to understand whether a difference existed between these two similar ethnic groups. I reviewed their differences in perception about their situation, as well as their awareness of the quality of social services available to them. The participants in this study were 10 Mexican immigrant and 7 Mexican American women who were living in Memphis, Tennessee when the research was conducted.

The qualitative data were collected through a semi-structured interview. Descriptive data and t-tests were reported for the quantitative data, and constant comparative analysis (Glaser, 1965) supported the interpretation of the qualitative data.

It develops a framework that considers banal manifestations of social integration in quotidian and national life. Concentrating on the case study of Russian-speakers and ethnic titulars in Latvia, it compares top-down, elite-led discourse on integration with lived interethnic interactions. In many conventional analyses, Latvia is considered a divided society wherein ethnic, linguistic, and cultural cleavages separate ethnic Latvians from the proportionally large population of Russian-speakers 'left behind' when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. This population has been analyzed through immigrant, diaspora, and fifth column frameworks that suggest Russian speakers remain outside of the Latvian state and nation, if not always civically, then certainly culturally. This dissertation argues the frameworks and indicators traditionally used to measure integration do not sufficiently consider integration in everyday experiences, and therefore overlook much of the integration that is occurring on the ground. Rather, banality -- or the lived experiences that fade into the hum of everyday life -- is an indicator of significant interpersonal and socio-national integration that incorporates minorities as active members of the nation. The dissertation considers relevant theories in the study of integration, nationalism, and identity to create frameworks of interpersonal and socio-national banal integration. These capture both person-to-person experiences and minority engagement with society and the state. The dissertation then links the theoretical concept with three critical elements in the Latvian integration debate. First, it notes the disconnect between top-down integration priorities and ground-level realities. Second, it examines banal integration in daily life, looking at interpersonal interactions, public spaces, and civic connections with the state. Finally, the dissertation considers the ways in which minorities engage as embedded members of the Latvian nation, looking at participation in cultural events and national holidays. Theoretically, this dissertation highlights the necessity of prioritizing banal, quotidian experiences over elite-led discourse in the study of integration. Methodologically, it accomplishes this goal through a multi-method approach, using extant document summary and analysis, medium-n survey data, and qualitative ethnography. Empirically, the dissertation pushes back against a narrative of conflict in Latvian and Russian-speaker relations. Indeed, it argues that not only is Latvian society far less divided than it discursively appears, in many cases, minorities see themselves as active members of the Latvian cultural and civic nation, not tangential to it. This dissertation is a dedicated analysis of the Latvian case, but contributes more broadly to the literature on post-Soviet diaspora and migration studies, integration studies, and questions of nationalism and identity in the modern global context.

The current study examines immigrant intentions to leave the host country, but not necessarily to return to the homeland. The predictive model, which focuses on immigrant subjective identity, was tested through a survey of 338 first and 1.5 generation Former Soviet Union (FSU) immigrants in Israel, who applied to a prominent NGO to obtain proof of their Jewishness. These individuals are from the largest recent immigrant group in Israel, and are highly represented among the young adult (aged 25–40) immigrants leaving Israel. The findings indicate that contrary to our expectations, Israeli local identity did not have a significant effect on the immigrants’ intentions to leave Israel. By contrast, Jewish identity and level of religiosity did play a significant role in attenuating the immigrant’s tendency to leave.

I use data from a 2009–2010 Internet survey into which I incorporated country‐contextual characteristics. The results of multivariate analyses show that a social integration combining duration of residence abroad and local citizenship enhances religio‐ethnic identification. Another measure of integration, social networks, deters group behaviors. All measures of general integration inhibit attachment to the home country, whereas religio‐ethnic acculturation is largely insignificant for transnationalism. The religiosity of the new country does not influence immigrants’ religio‐ethnic patterns or homeland attachment. Insofar as group size is a significant determinant of particularistic behaviors, it weakens them. The more policy‐based opportunities newcomers receive, the more they dissociate from group behaviors and homeland ties. Irrespective of individual and contextual factors, living in the United States encourages group affiliation more than living in Europe does. The results are discussed in reference to four working hypotheses—marginalization, integration, assimilation, and separation—and from a U.S.‐European comparative perspective.

However, those immigrant girls who were less acculturated in terms of language used at home were found to have only a quarter of the risk of dating violence as those more acculturated. The use of heritage language by immigrant Hispanic girls may be a protective factor against dating violence. Further studies are indicated to confirm this finding.

It explores the phenomenon known as the 'immigrant paradox,' whereby early generation adolescents exhibit more positive academic outcomes than their later generation peers, and tests whether the immigrant paradox can be explained via the processes of acculturation, ethnic identity, family obligation, cultural values like familismo, and belief in the American Dream. Using a mixed methods design, the study also investigates how family immigration and education stories impact the belief in the American Dream and educational beliefs and values. The quantitative study uses self-report survey data from 223 Latino 9th graders (and a subset of 135 Dominican 9 th graders) to investigate the presence of the 'immigrant paradox' and the underlying processes which may explain the impact of acculturation on academic outcomes. Findings from this study provide evidence for the 'immigrant paradox' in both the full sample as well as the Dominican subset. Furthermore, family obligation was found to have a significant positive effect on academic attitudes, and both familismo and belief in the American Dream were found to moderate the impact of acculturation on academic outcomes. These findings point to the importance of family processes and cultural values in motivating children of immigrants and later generation peers to succeed academically. The qualitative study continues to explore these relations by reviewing the family immigration and education stories of a subset of the 223 students. Students who reported family members immigrating to the U.S. to improve the lives of the next generation were more likely to believe in the American Dream. Family stories of positive educational experiences were positively related to adolescents' beliefs about the value of education, while family stories of negative peer interactions were negatively related to adolescents' beliefs about the value of education. Family stories of family-related school struggles were significantly related to greater academic efficacy. Findings from the qualitative study illustrate the potential motivational role of family stories on Latino adolescent educational beliefs and values and support the important influence of family factors on academic attitudes found in the quantitative study.

This study was designed to assess occupational, social, and personal/psychological aspects of adjustment to life in Israel among 150 heterosexual couples that immigrated together from the former Soviet Union after 1990. The mean age of participants was 46, over 60% had postsecondary education, and have lived in Israel for the average of 9 years. The study included a structured survey and in-depth interviews with 15 couples. The results suggest that overall levels of adjustment and well-being reported by men and women are rather similar, although they take somewhat different paths toward social integration. Men were doing better in the economic/occupational domain, whereas women were more active in the social domain (e.g., building their personal networks, exploring new lifestyles). Both men and women had experienced occupational downgrading in Israel, but more women worked in physically-demanding jobs such as geriatric nursing and cleaning. Women suffered a more dramatic occupational downgrading than men, as well as lower job security and under/unemployment. Yet, they showed more flexibility and tolerance of their new work roles. No tangible gender differences have been found in the general indicators of psychosocial well-being and overall satisfaction with life in Israel. Processes of social adjustment among immigrants from the former Soviet Union may be less gendered than in other immigrant communities, reflecting more egalitarian gender relations in the Russian/Soviet culture.

A survey was administered to 221 immigrant students, aged 14 to 18 years, enrolled in secondary schools. The results show that the levels of participation in physical activity and sport in young immigrants were lower than the Spanish. Moreover, generation and origin emerged as important elements in the process of sport acculturation; young African—Sub Saharan and Maghrebi—immigrants obtained a lower degree of sports acculturation; and the first generation students attained a lower level of sports acculturation than those of the 1.5 and second generations. In conclusion, schools should review their educational activities if they want to eliminate inequalities in the acculturation process of students from different origins.

Aims of the study: To investigate the relationship between social integration and psychological distress in immigrants in Oslo, Norway, with focus on gender differences. Methods: The study was based on data from a community survey in Oslo (N = 15899), and included 1448 immigrants from non-Western and 1059 immigrants from Western countries. Psychological distress was measured by a 10 items version of Hopkins Symptom Check List (HSCL-10), and social integration was measured by an index based on four items: Knowledge of the Norwegian language, reading Norwegian newspapers, visits by Norwegians and receiving help from Norwegians. Information on paid employment, household income, marital status, social support and conflicts in intimate relationships was also included in the study. Results: The non-western immigrants showed a higher level of psychological distress than the immigrants from western countries. In men this could be explained by the combination of less social integration, less employment, lower income, less social support and more conflicts in intimate relationships among non-western compared to western immigrants. In women the difference in level of psychological stress could not be explained by these variables, even if it was reduced. A reason for this seemed to be that social integration in non-western immigrants had a different effect on mental health in men and women. In men, social integration showed a positive effect through employment and income, as well as a positive effect in other areas. Also in non-western women social integration showed a positive effect through greater access to employment and income, but this effect was leveled out by integration causing problems in other areas. Conclusion: Unexpectedly, social integration in non-western immigrants was associated with good mental health in men, but not in women. A possible explanation for this might be that the traditional female role in these countries is more challenged by social integration into a Western country than the male role, resulting in conflicting norms, threat to the self and/or loss of identity.

Second, Iranian immigrants who have high acculturation degree have high level of QoL. A 2 X 2 factorial ANOVA and a one-way ANOVA were utilized respectively. Results demonstrated the following associations between Low Level of Individuation from Father (IF) and High Level of Physical QoL, High level of Individuation from Mother (IM) and High level of Psychological QoL, High Level of IM and High Level of Environmental QoL, High Acculturation Degree (AD) and High level of Overall QoL, High AD and High Physical QoL, High AD and High Psychological QoL, and High AD and High Environmental QoL only in First- Generations.

After adjustment for potential confounders, current smoking prevalence was higher and the quit rate was lower for Korean, Filipino, and Vietnamese American men compared with Chinese American men. Women's current smoking prevalence was lower than men's in all six Asian American subgroups. South Asian and Korean American women reported lower quit rates than women from other ethnic subgroups. Asian American men who reported using only English at home had lower current smoking prevalence and higher quit rates, except for Filipino and South Asian American men. Asian American women who reported using only English at home had higher current smoking prevalence except for Japanese women. Being a second or later generation immigrant was associated with lower smoking prevalence among all Asian American subgroups of men. Less educated men and women had higher smoking prevalence and lower quit rates. In conclusion, both current smoking prevalence and quit rates vary distinctively across gender and ethnic subgroups among Asian Americans in California. Acculturation appears to increase the risk of cigarette smoking for Asian American women.

As regards the integration hypothesis, psychological adaptation and intercultural adaptation were predicted by integration, while sociocultural adaptation was only predicted by marginalization.

The contact hypothesis tended to be supported, as intercultural contact was predicted by higher positive attitudes toward Portuguese, and assimilation. However, integration has not emerged as a significant predictor of intercultural contact. This sample displayed a relatively low level of perceived discrimination.

The results show that immigrants tend to change their preferences on Internet use to reflect their residence in the host country. In particular, the longer an immigrant resides in the host country, the less likely they would be to surf their original country’s websites and the more likely they would be to communicate with local people via the Internet. More importantly, differences in Internet usage are found to have a significant impact on immigrants’ intercultural adaptation. In an online environment, the social communication in the host country is a critical component that can facilitate or impede immigrants’ successful adaptation to the host country, whereas ethnic social communication also plays a role at the initial stage of transition.

Further, the influence of immigrant status, Anglo orientation, Latino orientation, and the interaction of immigrant status and acculturation variables on IPV were examined. Data came from the Sexual Assault Among Latinas (SALAS) study that gathered data from a national sample of Latino women (N = 2,000) via telephone interviews. Results showed 15.6 % of Latino women experienced IPV in their lifetime and threat IPV was the most common form of IPV. Physical, sexual, stalking and threat IPV were all used as abusive tactics in various configurations. Logistic regression analyses showed immigrants were less likely than U.S. born Latino women to experience any IPV and physical IPV. Anglo orientation was associated with increased odds of any IPV and stalking IPV while Latino orientation was associated with decreased odds of all forms of IPV. Furthermore, the protective effect of Latino orientation for stalking IPV was pronounced among immigrants. Together the results show that 1 in 6 Latino women experience IPV and that sociocultural factors such as immigrant status and acculturation are important considerations for this group, underscoring the influence of migration and cultural adaptation to family functioning.

Using Add Health data, we examine the effect of different aspects of assimilation on educational achievement, psychological well-being, and at-risk behaviors. We find that the effect of assimilation varies greatly depending on the ethnic group and outcome under consideration, but that it is generally related to both greater academic achievement and more at-risk behavior. We conclude that assimilation theory is still relevant, but suggest an interpretation that emphasizes a process of decreasing differences between groups rather than either detrimental or beneficial effects of assimilation.

Specifically, we analyzed the association among socio-economic status (SES), integration in the labor market, specific immigration experience characteristics, and PD in a multi-ethnic sample of immigrant individuals residing in Lisbon, Portugal. Design: Using a sample (n = 1375) consisting of all main immigrant groups residing in Portugal’s metropolitan area of Lisbon, we estimated multivariable linear regression models of PD regressed on selected sets of socio-economic independent variables. A psychological distress scale was constructed based on five items (feeling physically tired, feeling psychologically tired, feeling happy, feeling full of energy, and feeling lonely). Results: Variables associated with a decrease in PD are being a male (demographic), being satisfied with their income level (SES), living with the core family and having higher number of children (social isolation), planning to remain for longer periods of time in Portugal (migration project), and whether respondents considered themselves to be in good health condition (subjective health status). Study variables negatively associated with immigrants’ PD were job insecurity (labor market), and the perception that health professionals were not willing to understand immigrants during a clinical interaction. Conclusion: The study findings emphasized the importance of labor market integration and access to good quality jobs for immigrants’ psychological well-being, as well as the existence of family ties in the host country, intention to reside long term in the host country, and high subjective (physical) health.

Multinomial logistic regression models estimated relationships between language use (a measure of acculturation) and patterns of adherence, by gender, to multiple cancer-preventive health behaviors using adherence scores. Hispanics had greater odds of adherence to multiple behaviors compared to Non-Hispanics (OR = 2.76 [2.27, 3.36]). Hispanics with greater English language use had lower odds of adherence (OR = 0.45 [0.29, 0.69]). Women were more adherent than men (P < 0.01) and their language use was associated with patterns of behavioral adherence more so than among men. Differences by gender and language use were identified in patterns of adherence to behavioral recommendations among the Hispanic population.

"1427","Search2021","thesis",2019,"Roth, Kimberly B.","Latinos' experiences in the US: Acculturation, discrimination, stress, social cohesion and psychiatric disorder.",1,NA,"Background: Latinos are the largest foreign-born group and one of the fastest growing minority groups in the United States. As such, they will increasingly contribute to the burden of mental and behavioral disorders. Acculturation and other related experiences are associated with the development of mental disorder in US-residing Latinos, however most studies treat Latinos as a homogeneous group. This obscures meaningful between-group differences and hinders the elucidation of potential mechanisms contributing to the association between acculturation and mental health outcomes. Further, despite its importance, acculturation has been measured insufficiently and inconsistently. This is especially problematic due to the complex nature of these constructs. To understand the mechanism by which acculturation impacts mental health, novel methods are needed. Latent variable methods are one such approach that has been recommended as a way to capture nuance of complex constructs such as acculturation. Methods: Data come from the National Latino and Asian American Study, a nationally-representative, cross-sectional survey of 2,554 Latinos in the United States. Results: The six scales of acculturation (English and Spanish language preference and proficiency, ethnic identity) and related experiences (discrimination, acculturative stress, neighborhood context, family context) had good construct validity. No scales achieved full measurement invariance, but some scales were more variant across subgroups than others. Four latent classes of Latinos' acculturative experiences emerged: Positive Experiences (n=1,743, 69%), Cohesive-Conflict (n=424, 17%), Marginalized Conflict (n=237, 9%), and Marginalized (n=137, 5%). These classes were highly associated with all three categories of DSM-IV disorder: depressive, anxiety, and substance use disorders after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, subethnicity and generational status. The Positive Experiences class had the lowest lifetime prevalence of all three disorders (14.8%, 13.6% and 7.1%, respectively). The class associated with the highest disorder prevalence (34.0%, 26.6%, and 22.5%, respectively) was those Latinos with a Marginalized Conflict experience. After accounting for acculturative experiences, direct associations between subethnicity and generational status and disorder varied. There were no significant direct effects between subethnicity and substance use disorder prevalence, but a strong dose-response relationship of generational status. Conversely, subethnicity was directly related to depressive and anxiety disorder prevalence, but generational status was not. Conclusions: Acculturation and other experiences related to immigrant and minority status in the US are complex constructs and should be treated as such. Latent variable methods help account for measurement variance by subgroup and the unobserved nature of the constructs. Latinos have varied acculturative experiences in the US, which are highly personal and not fully accounted for by observed characteristics such as country of origin.

It is argued that the values, beliefs, and ultimate concerns of these young immigrants have been the underlying forces behind their efforts in adjusting to the challenges in a strange land. Of particular importance are contentment and gratitude, a strong family concept, 'face', an urge for knowledge, a sense of crisis, faith in life, and the identity of a marginal man. These themes reflect the importance of cultural values in shaping migration behaviors. The differences found between the two groups also point to the need to understand migration experience in the context of the developmental stage as well as the social, economic and political situations at the time of migration.

One component of acculturation that has not been widely explored in relation to children’s socioemotional development is limited English proficiency (LEP). Given that English is the main language used in American schools, it is important to understand how LEP can affect the socioemotional development of children from immigrant families whose 1st language is not English. This study explores the effects of LEP on the socioemotional development of 5,268 Hispanic and 2,088 Asian American children from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study data set (first 3 waves of data). Results from generalized estimating equation analyses revealed significant interactions between ethnicity and language status. English-proficient Asian American children fared better than Hispanic children, but Asian American children with LEP lagged behind their Hispanic counterparts in their approaches to learning, self-control, and interpersonal skills at the beginning of kindergarten. These ethnic differences disappeared by the end of 1st grade. Practice or Policy: Our findings suggest that language-related challenges among minority children may be more consequential for young Asian American children, who would benefit from additional efforts to help them attain proficiency in English.

An ordinary least-squares regression model, controlling for fixed effects, produced results supporting the hypothesis that linguistic acculturation moderates the effect of context on self-esteem. The self-esteem of Hispanic adolescents who were less linguistically acculturated was found to be more favorable when with family than with friends and the reverse was found for the more linguistically acculturated participants. Adolescents in the middle of the linguistic acculturation process had the widest variance in self-esteem between times they were with their families and times in other contexts; they experienced more positive self-esteem with anyone but family. Findings underscore the need to better understand the complex process of linguistic acculturation and its effects on self-esteem.

This paper describes the psychosocial factors associated with subjective health and wellbeing outcomes among a cohort of 97 refugee youth (aged 11-19) during their first three years in Melbourne, Australia. The findings reported here are drawn from the Good Starts Study, a longitudinal investigation of settlement and wellbeing among refugee youth conducted between 2004 and 2008. The overall aim of Good Starts was to identify the psychosocial factors that assist youth with refugee backgrounds in making a good start in their new country. A particular focus was on key transitions: from pre-arrival to Australia, from the language school to mainstream school, and from mainstream school to higher education or to the workforce. Good Starts used a mix of both method and theory from anthropology and social epidemiology. Using standardized measures of wellbeing and generalised estimating equations to model the predictors of wellbeing over time, this paper reports that key factors strongly associated with wellbeing outcomes are those that can be described as indicators of belonging—the most important being subjective social status in the broader Australian community, perceived discrimination and bullying. We argue that settlement specific policies and programs can ultimately be effective if embedded within a broader socially inclusive society—one that offers real opportunities for youth with refugee backgrounds to flourish.

We investigated the longitudinal relationship between three domains of acculturation (traditionalism, biculturalism, assimilation) and alcohol use among 302 Vietnamese and Cambodian women in Washington State. Methods: Data were obtained from the Cross Cultural Families Project (CCF), a 5-year longitudinal investigation of a random sample of Vietnamese and Cambodian immigrant families living in Washington State. Alcohol use was measured with a three item scale assessing frequency and quantity of use, and binge drinking. Acculturation was measured with the Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identity Acculturation Scale. Linear mixed effects regression models were estimated to assess the impact of acculturation on alcohol use among the overall sample and among a sub-sample of only women who consumed any alcohol. Results: A majority of the sample, 73.2%, reported no alcohol use. In the overall sample, none of the three acculturation domains were significantly associated with drinking. Among a sub-sample of only those who reported any alcohol use, however, a greater degree of traditional cultural identification (β = −0.94, SE = 0.44, P = 0.03) and a greater degree of biculturalism (β = −1.33, SE = 0.53, P = 0.01) were associated with lower levels of use.

Among marginal immigrants, a higher need for uniqueness predicted higher self‐esteem (Study 1), affect (Study 2), and life satisfaction (Study 3), and marginally higher happiness (Study 2) and self‐esteem (Study 3). No relationship between the need for uniqueness and adjustment was found among non‐marginal immigrants. The adaptive value of the need for uniqueness for marginal immigrants is discussed.

While immigrant adolescents are faced with the realities of 2 different cultures, they also have to master age-salient tasks, such as self-efficacy and identity development. To get a better insight into the interplay of developmental and acculturative tasks and their relationship with family functioning, we used 3-wave longitudinal data over a 2-year period from 13-year-old immigrant students (N = 609) in Athens, Greece. Cross-lagged models revealed that family functioning and acculturation were resources for the mastery of developmental tasks. Involvement in the host culture prospectively predicted self-efficacy beliefs, and involvement in the ethnic culture prospectively predicted ethnic identity. These effects increased over time. Family functioning prospectively predicted self-efficacy and ethnic identity. These effects decreased over time. The findings suggest that a well-functioning family, for early adolescents, and being involved in the host culture and in ethnic cultures, for middle adolescents, are particularly important resources to master the tasks of their developmental period. Our findings underscore the importance of developmentally sensitive approaches and the need to account for acculturative challenges in order to understand individual differences in immigrant youth adaptation.

Research on migrant health mostly examines labor migrants, with some attention paid to the trauma faced by refugees. Marriage migrants represent an understudied vulnerable population in the migration and health literature. Objectives. Drawing on a Social Determinants of Health (SDH) approach, we use a large Korean national survey and stratified multivariate regressions to examine the link between migration processes and the self-rated health of Korea's three largest ethnic groups of marriage migrants: Korean-Chinese, Vietnamese, and Han Chinese. Results. We find that post-migration socioeconomic status and several social integration factors are associated with the health of marriage migrants of all three groups. Specifically, having more social relationships with Koreans is associated with good health among marriage migrants, while having more social relationships with co-ethnics is associated with worse health. Marriage migrants' perceived social status of their natal and marital families is a better predictor of their health than more objective measures such as their education attainment and that of their Korean husbands. The post-migration social gradients among all ethnic groups demonstrate a dose-response effect of marital family's social standing on marriage migrants' health, independent of their own education and the social standing of their natal families. Lastly, we find some ethnicity-specific predictors such as the association between higher educational level and worse health status among the Vietnamese. This variability by group suggests a more complex set of SDH occurred during the marriage migration processes than a basic SDH framework would predict. Conclusion. Using a new immigrant destination, South Korea, as an example, we conclude that migration and health policies that reduce ethnicity-specific barriers and offer integration programs in early post-migration stages may offer a pathway to good health among marriage migrants.

Specifically, we were interested in the ways in which Jewish immigrant adolescents from the former Soviet Union integrate their Russian, Jewish, and American identities, and to what extent identification with these three cultures predicts adaptation to varied life domains. In order to examine whether being Jewish has an impact on salience and predictive value of Russian and American identities, a sample of Jewish adolescents (n = 100) was compared with a sample of non-Jewish (n = 113) adolescent immigrants from the former Soviet Union. The study suggests that Jewish and non-Jewish adolescent immigrants differ in levels of Russian and American identity. Further, using structural equation modeling a bicultural model for Jewish and non-Jewish adolescents was tested. The results suggest that these two groups do not differ with respect to how Russian and American identities impact on adjustment. However, adding Jewish identity to the model for the Jewish sample significantly improved model fit, and rendered some of the impact of Russian identity non-significant. Thus a multicultural model that included all three identities had better explanatory power for this sample than a bicultural one.

Recent studies of transnationalism introduce a more complex back-and-forth variety of migration, providing ways to explain differences among migratory subgroups. Building on segmented assimilation and transnationalism perspectives, this research addresses the maze of adjustment processes encountered by participants in this study--Latina teenagers who recently immigrated to the U.S. and attend a mid-western high school. This paper proposes an integrated model of gender and acculturation by focusing on adaptation processes. Using qualitative data gathered through group interviews, observation, and survey, the study examines how interaction is organized around gender, ethnicity, and immigrant status. The Latinas invoke ethnic identity to resist an American gender order. However, institutional structures, such as English-as-Second-Language classes, shape practices that have differential effects for girls and boys. Latinas are subject to harsher control both within families and the conformist school culture, which marks them as outsiders more than it does their male peers. These practices reveal the gendered makeup of interaction as distinct from characteristics and beliefs of the individual, and adjustment processes as segmented along structural gender lines. A gendered ethnicity and ethnic gendering reinforces the gender order, but in a way specific to local gender practices and immigrant status.

When ethnic identity and American identity were examined simultaneously, consistent with existing research, ethnic identity was positively associated with positive relationships, high self-esteem, academic motivation, and lower levels of depression over time. Although American identity was not significantly associated with depression, positive links with relationships, self-esteem, and academic motivation were found.

The present paper reports the results of two studies testing the hypothesis that, in France, the cultural norm of new laïcité (a French‐specific ideology of secularism) can moderate the impact of the perceived host culture adoption and national identification on discrimination against immigrants. We conducted a correlational study (Study 1, N = 249) and an experiment (Study 2, N = 143) using two distinct and previously validated measures of intergroup discrimination. Results showed that the higher the perception of a norm of new laïcité, the stronger the link between host culture adoption and national identification. More specifically, among native French people, the perception of a weak host culture adoption and a weak national identification on the part of immigrants produced higher levels of discriminatory behavior especially when the intergroup norm of new laïcité was high. These studies highlight the fundamental importance of taking into account culture‐specific variables in the study of discrimination and point to the fact that, by changing the normative context, one may change intergroup behaviors. Reducing intergroup discrimination in applied settings may require targeting culture‐specific intergroup norms.

Perceived discrimination was the most salient variable in the model and showed significant associations with all outcome measures.

In Study 1, surveys were administered to 56 participants to refine the scale. In Study 2, psychometric evaluation of cross-sectional data with 344 participants showed high reliability and validity. Exploratory factor analysis generated a three-factor explanation, which aligned with the hypothesized conceptual framework: ambiguous loss of homeland, satisfaction with the homeland, and satisfaction with the United States.

For the most common form of sex reported, vaginal sex, condom use was infrequent. However, men did report confidence in being able to insist on condom use in challenging sexual situations, and they also reported fairly frequent pro-condom attitudes and behaviors within their social circles. Slightly over half of the men reported sexual activity with female partners, during the past 2 months.

Data sources: Sixty women from local community settings were given the PPDS-S instrument and the General Acculturation Index to screen for PPD symptoms. Data were then compared with previously published community clinic data. Conclusion: Sixty percent of the immigrant Hispanic women showed significant PPD. The only statistically significant positive predictive factor for increased PPD symptoms was having a previous history of depression. In addition, 54% had an elevated symptom content profile score for suicidal thinking. Implications for practice: Health practitioners should be aware of a potentially high rate of PPD in this population, especially in light of previously studied increased rates of suicide attempts in Latinas. If a prior history of depression is predictive of PPD, it is possible that many of the mothers in our sample suffered from depression prior to the postpartum period, but were not appropriately diagnosed or treated.

However, they have encountered many adjustment difficulties arising from cultural and social differences after entering into the Australian workplace. There is a dearth of research to shed light on the adaptation of PCIs in Australia. To bridge this gap, this paper investigates PCIs’ acculturation preference and explores the predictors of each acculturation attitude. Our survey of a sample of 220 PCIs revealed that PCIs have a predominant preference to maintain their home culture, whereas logistic regressions revealed that length of residence in the host country, English proficiency, perceived social support at work and interdependent self-construal could predict the acculturation choices among PCIs. This study provides valuable information for managers and organizations in developing effective acculturation programs to assist immigrant employees with adaptation to a new workplace.

How does gender affect the relationships between post-migration experience and positive mental health? To address these questions, the current study uses data from Statistics Canada’s 2013 General Social Survey (GSS), a nationally representative household study that included 27,695 Canadians 15 years of age and older. The study compares self-reported positive mental health among 651 refugees, 309 economic immigrants, and 448 family class immigrants from 50 source countries. Immigration-related predictors of mental health were examined including sociodemographic characteristics, discrimination, acculturation variables, and experiences of reception. Separate analyses were carried out for women and men. Refugees had lower levels of positive mental health than other migrants. Affiliative feelings towards the source country jeopardized refugee, but not immigrant mental health. A sense of belonging to Canada was a significant predictor of mental health. Perceived discrimination explained refugee mental health disadvantage among men, but not women. Bridging social networks were a mental health asset, particularly for women. The implications of anti-refugee discrimination net of the effects of anti-immigrant and anti-visible minority antipathies are discussed, as well as possible reasons for gender differences in the salience of mental health predictors.

Although the vast majority of the immigration-focused psychological research has centered primarily on migration-related challenges and negative outcomes, in recent years interest has turned to understanding the factors that contribute to positive immigrant well-being. While social support provided in face-to-face contexts has been identified as a particularly salient predictor of positive psychological functioning, little attention has been directed toward exploring the influence of online social support and unsupportive online social interactions on immigrants' mental health. The original purpose of the present study was to address this gap in the literature by examining, via an online survey, how various aspects of the social support immigrants receive through their online social networks (OSNs) affect their psychological well-being. However, due to an inadequate number of responses obtained for the subset of survey questions related to immigrants' received online social support, the study's focus shifted to investigating predictive factors of immigrants' subjective psychological well-being following resettlement in the destination country. A second goal was to evaluate the relative importance of perceived online social support versus perceived offline (face-to-face) social support in predicting immigrants' subjective well-being. Thus, the present research examined the effects of six selected sociodemographic factors (age, gender, race, marital status, education, and religiosity), past and current life stressors (traumatic events experienced before and after coming to Canada, stressful events experienced in the past 12 months), psychological resources (cultural adaptation, sense of mastery), as well as online and offline perceived social support on immigrants' subjective psychological well-being. The outcome variables included measures of positive (life satisfaction, flourishing) and negative (loneliness, immigrant distress, existential isolation, and perceived stress) aspects of immigrants' psychological functioning. A series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses was conducted on a final sample of 120 immigrants of varying backgrounds residing in Montreal, Canada. Results indicated that marital status (being married), education (having completed less than a university degree), greater cultural adaptation, a higher sense of mastery, and greater perceived offline social support all predicted higher levels of positive psychological functioning. Negative mental health outcomes were associated with marital status (being single), race (identifying as Non-Caucasian), having experienced a traumatic event before coming to Canada, poorer cultural adaptation, lower levels of self-mastery, and lower perceived online social support. Age, gender, religiosity, traumatic events experienced after coming to Canada, and stressful events experienced in the past year were not found to be significant predictors of subjective psychological well-being in this sample. Moreover, perceived offline social support predicted higher positive psychological functioning, while greater perceived online social support was associated only with lower levels of existential isolation. Implications of the current findings and suggestions for future research are discussed.

The article studied the prevalence of clinically significant depressive symptoms among elderly Turkish and Moroccan migrants compared with native Dutch elderly and if differences in prevalence rates were explained by known risk factors for depression and/or ethnic, migration-related factors. Methods: 330 Turkish, 299 Moroccan, and 304 Dutch elderly (55-74 years) were interviewed (cross-sectionally) using the Center for Epidemiologic Depression Scale (CES-D). Potential risk factors included sex, income level, marital status, ethnic origin, chronic physical illnesses, limitations in daily functioning, migration and acculturation questions. Results: The prevalence of self-reported depressive symptoms (CES-D >16) was very high in elderly migrants, 33.6% for Moroccan and 61.5% for Turkish elderly. The prevalence of depressive symptoms in the native Dutch sample was similar to earlier studies in the Netherlands and abroad: 14.5%. Among migrants education and income level was very low and they had a high number of physical limitations and chronic medical illnesses. This only explained part of the ethnic differences found. In all three samples, depressive symptoms were associated with sex, chronic physical illness and physical limitations. In multivariate analysis, ethnic origin was uniquely associated with the presence of clinically significant depressive symptoms. Only a small number of remigration and acculturation items were associated with depressive symptoms in bivariate analysis. Conclusions: The prevalence of clinically significant depressive symptoms among elderly migrants from Turkey and Morocco in the Netherlands is very high.

This study aimed to compare the prevalence of physical symptoms among White, Latino and Asian Americans, and examine the association of symptoms and acculturation. Methods: We analyzed data from the National Latino and Asian American Study, a nationally representative survey of 4864 White, Latino and Asian American adults. We compared the age- and gender-adjusted prevalence of 14 physical symptoms among the racial/ethnic groups and estimated the association between indicators of acculturation (English proficiency, nativity, generational status and proportion of lifetime in the United States) and symptoms among Latino and Asian Americans. Results: After adjusting for age and gender, the mean number of symptoms was similar for Whites (1.00) and Latinos (0.95) but significantly lower among Asian Americans (0.60, P < .01 versus Whites). Similar percentages of Whites (15.4%) and Latinos (13.0%) reported three or more symptoms, whereas significantly fewer Asian Americans (7.7%, P < .05 versus Whites) did. In models adjusted for sociodemographic variables and clinical status (psychological distress, medical conditions and disability), acculturation was significantly associated with physical symptoms among both Latino and Asian Americans, such that the most acculturated individuals had the most physical symptoms. Conclusions: The prevalence of physical symptoms differs across racial/ethnic groups, with Asian Americans reporting fewer symptoms than Whites. Consistent with a 'healthy immigrant' effect, increased acculturation was strongly associated with greater symptom burden among both Latino and Asian Americans.

The aims were to determine the prevalence of postpartum depressive symptoms, PPDS, identify associations with ethnicity and with the level of social integration. Method: Population-based, prospective cohort study of 643 pregnant women (58% ethnic minorities) attending primary antenatal care in Oslo. Questionnaires regarding demographics and health issues were collected through interviews. PPDS was defined as a sum score ≥ 10 by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, used as the main outcome in logistic regression analyses, first with ethnicity, second with level of integration as main explanatory factors. Results: The prevalence of PPDS was higher in ethnic minorities 12.7% (95% CI: 9.31–16.09) than in Western Europeans 4.8% (2.26–7.34). Adverse life events, lack of social support and depressive symptoms during the index pregnancy were other significant risk factors. Western European with PPDS were more likely to have had depressive symptoms also during pregnancy than women from ethnic minorities (72.2% versus 33.3%, p = 0.041). When replacing ethnicity with integration, a low level of integration was independently associated with PPDS (2.1 (1.11–3.95)). Limitations: Cases with PPDS were limited. Heterogeneity in the ethnic groups is a concern. Conclusion: Both point prevalence and new onset of PPDS was higher among ethnic minorities than among Western Europeans. Low level of integration was associated with PPDS. Our findings suggest that clinicians should be aware of the increased risk of new cases of PPDS among ethnic minorities compared to Western European women and offer evidence-based care accordingly.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Texas City Stress and Health Study conducted in Texas City, Texas during 2004–2006. Participants: A total of 1435 Mexican-Americans aged 25 years and older. Measures: Binge drinking (≥6 drinks per occasion by men and ≥4 drinks per occasion by women) and scoring positive on the CAGE (a four-item clinical measure of problem drinking) as dependent variables. Key independent variables included a measure of language acculturation, proportion of Hispanics in the participant's neighborhood according to 2000 U.S. Census data, and being foreign-born compared with being U.S.-born. Analysis: Logistic regression analysis was used to predict being a binge drinker and being positive on the CAGE. Results: Foreign-born women were less likely to be binge drinkers than U.S.-born women. Nativity was not significant among men. Moreover women were less likely to be binge drinkers if they lived in heavily Hispanic neighborhoods. No such effect was found among men. Similar results were obtained with the CAGE. Conclusions: We found a powerful influence of nativity (being U.S.-born compared with foreign born) and neighborhood Hispanic concentration on problem drinking among women but not among men. It is likely that cultural norms in heavily Hispanic environments discourage problem drinking among women but not among men.

This study extends existing knowledge by exploring the short-term health impact of a large scale population displacement resulting from China’s Three Gorges Dam Project. The study is theoretically guided by the stress process model, but we supplement it with Cernea’s Impoverishment Risks and Reconstruction (IRR) model widely used in displacement literature. Our panel analysis indicates that the displacement is associated positively with relocatees’ depression level, and negatively with their self-rated health measured against a control group. In addition, a path analysis suggests that displacement also affects depression and self-rated health indirectly by changing social integration, socioeconomic status, and community resources. The importance of social integration as a protective mechanism, a factor that has been overlooked in past studies of population displacement, is highlighted in this study.

However, research on health impacts of project-induced displacement is insufficient. The existing literature concerning the causal effect of migration on health is inconclusive due to the selective nature of migration and other methodological problems. This study employs the stress process model as the major theoretical framework, components from Cernea’s IRR model as well as Scudder and Colson’s framework are also incorporated to examine the short-term health impact of the displacement resulting from China’s Three Gorges Dam Project. I also explore whether the displacement’s effect on health is mediated by three secondary stressors, i.e., deterioration in social integration, SES, and community resources. To address the methodological problems typical in migration studies, we use the natural experiment design to collect pre- and post-migration data from both migrants and non-migrants (the control group). The pre-migration survey interviewed 775 designated migrants and 555 non-migrants in 2003. We successfully traced 1070 subjects in post-migration survey conducted in 2006. Using the difference model and the structural equation modeling procedures as analytical strategies, we found that the displacement heightened migrants’ depression, and worsened their self-rated health. The displacement was also responsible for deterioration in social integration, socio-economic status, and community material resources. The observed effects of the displacement on migrants’ health were mainly mediated by undesirable changes in social integration and income. This study suggests that social integration, a factor which has been overlooked in past studies, is at least as important as economic factors in affecting the health of the displaced. It also demonstrates the utility of the stress process model for studying mental and physical health of project-induced migrants in an Eastern culture setting.

This chapter examines the psychological and sociocultural adaptation of ethnocultural youth with the following broad question in mind: 'How well adapted are youth with an immigrant background in their society of settlement?' Specifically, we consider how well immigrant youth are doing with respect to psychological well-being (positive self-esteem and lower levels of mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic symptoms), and how satisfied they are with their lives. The chapter also looks at the extent of their adjustment in school and their behavioral problems (i.e., antisocial behavior). With respect to adaptation, we also briefly explore the immigrant paradox phenomenon. This chapter has three main parts. The first discusses the conceptual and empirical background to our broad questions, and the instruments used to measure the constructs. This part is not intended to be an exhaustive literature review on psychological and sociocultural adaptation; interested readers are directed to other sources, such as Ward (2001). The second part of the chapter presents a comparative overview of adaptation patterns across the different countries. Here, we compare the adaptation of immigrant youth in the different societies of settlement. In addition, we examine the relationship between the various adaptation outcomes and the factor structure of adaptation. We explore how the various adaptation outcomes are related to each other and how these relate to the four acculturation profiles previously identified in chapter 4. (Further exploration of the relationships between how youth engage in their intercultural relations and how well they adapt will be covered in chapter 6). The third part of the chapter discusses the findings in relation to the literature reviewed at the beginning of the chapter. See record [rid]2006-05033-000[/rid] for details of the ICSEY project.

Acculturation was assessed as a bidimensional process comprising attachment to the heritage culture and adaptation to the local Swiss culture, using the Vancouver Index of Acculturation. AA in migrant women was mainly predicted by psychosocial factors, namely socioeconomic status, marital support, family presence in Geneva and parity, while AD was predicted by one dimension of acculturation, i.e., attachment to the heritage culture.

Additionally, we studied the mediating role of affiliation with cannabis-using peers. Method: Data were utilized from i4culture, a Dutch study on immigrant adolescents and young adults aged 15–24 years. Participants belonged to the five largest immigrant populations in the Netherlands, living in or around the four major Dutch cities: Amsterdam, the Hague, Rotterdam, and Utrecht. In total, 771 adolescents and young adults (mean age 19.29, SD = 2.61, 53.8% female) from Surinamese (n = 210, 27.2%), Moroccan (n = 209, 27.1%), Turkish (n = 110, 14.3%), Antillean (n = 109, 14.1%), and Asian (n = 133, 17.3%) backgrounds participated. With questionnaires, past year cannabis use, acculturation strategy, linguistic acculturation, and affiliation with cannabis-using peers were assessed. Results: Using logistic regression analyses, we found no relation between acculturation strategy and past year cannabis use (OR = 1.25, p = 0.38 for separation vs integration and OR = 0.86, p = 0.50 for marginalization vs integration). Linguistic acculturation was positively related to cannabis use (OR = 2.20, p < 0.01). Affiliation with cannabis-using peers partly mediated this relation (OR = 1.09, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Non-Western immigrant youngsters who speak the host culture’s language at home are more likely to use cannabis than youngsters who speak their native language at home. The former group is more likely to affiliate with cannabis-using peers, which partly explains their increased risk of cannabis use.

The study examined the relative influence of demographic characteristics, flight-related characteristics, host-related characteristics, residency characteristics, acculturation characteristics, and adaptation stresses upon refugees' employment status and estimated earnings. Although previous studies have extensively examined demographic and residency characteristics, the relative influence of the other factors has not been comprehensively investigated. Multivariate analyses indicated that across the different refugee groups, the model explained 34-44% of the variance in employment status and 12-26% of the variance in estimated earnings. Consistent with previous findings, demographic characteristics, in particular, education, gender, and household composition, had the largest effects on the indicators of economic adaptation. The remaining factors had relatively small effects. The implications for refugee resettlement theory, policy, practice, and future research are discussed in light of these and previous findings.

Unlike other socio-political categories individuals cannot self-identify as refugee; the category must be bureaucratically conferred. Therefore sustained humanitarian public concern is vital to the acceptance of refugees. This article sets parameters on this public concern. It examines how public narratives reify the refugee category. Showing how this reification constrains the citizenship, integration and opportunities of individuals, now safe, yet continually categorized in everyday public discourse as refugee. Interviews, focus groups (Study 1) and ethnography (Study 2) were conducted in Sweden and the United Kingdom (N = 57). The article introduces a counterposing dialogical analysis where public positioning of refugees is counterposed against dialogue by 'refugees' anticipating their positioning. The analysis uncovers an hegemonic social representation of humanitarianism indexing 'the refugee' as the passive recipient of help framed by a public narrative diachronically frozen in the initial act of flight. Three objectifying reification processes stabilize the category. 'Refugees' in turn employ counter-positional tactics of distancing, compensation and future-orientation. The limited success of these tactics suggest the need to scale up such tactics to collective-level communication strategies. Success of communication strategies requires questioning the underlying function humanitarian-talk serves in creating a sense of European identity. Together these strategies could re-work the temporal features of the refugee category facilitating a repositioning and enabling the emergence of post-refugee narratives.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate structural relations among this set of variables using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) via AMOS 17.0. The results of SEM analyses documented acceptable fit of a model which hypothesized that relations between acculturation and alcohol use variables are mediated partially by acculturative stress, perceived peer alcohol use, and perceived injunctive social norms. While significant path coefficients were documented for paths between (a) acculturation and acculturative stress and (b) acculturative stress and alcohol use, the coefficients had negative signs, contrary to existing studies investigating these relations among immigrant youth. While paths between (a) perceived peer alcohol use or (b) perceived injunctive social norms and participants’ alcohol use were significant, path coefficients between acculturation and either (a) perceived peer alcohol use or (b) perceived injunctive social norms were not statistically significant. In addition, multiple-group comparisons suggested that social support had a significant moderating influence on several significant paths in the structural model. Specifically, international students reporting higher social support reported lower scores for acculturative stress and alcohol use, in contrast to their counterparts who reported lower scores for social support.

It also comments on aspects of psychometric tools and their appropriateness for use in cross-cultural management research. Design/methodology/approach: Black and Stephen’s Cross-Cultural Adjustment Scale was translated into Arabic using the method of back-translation and a pilot item-by-item debriefing. It was then administered to 111 Arabic-speaking employees of a single firm. Findings: The Arabic language version yielded high alpha coefficients and a subsequent factor analysis revealed three primary factors of cross-cultural adjustment, namely, Work Adjustment, Interaction Adjustment and General Adjustment, which corresponded closely to the original English version of the scale, with two minor exceptions. Research limitations/implications: The research is confined to the cultural-linguistic context in which it was executed. Practical implications: The findings suggest that an Arabic version of the three-factor scale is useful for measuring adjustment in Arabic-speaking samples and implies the wider generalizability of the cross-cultural adjustment construct. The development of this scale in an important region for migrant labor is highly relevant to practice. Originality/value: An Arabic version of the most widely used cross-cultural adjustment scale is of value to researchers and practitioners.

Study design: A cross-sectional study was undertaken among a sample of 1384 Turks and Moroccans aged 35–74 years in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Methods: Data were collected by structured face-to-face interviews. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from self-reported height and weight data. Sociodemographic variables collected were sex, age, educational level, marital status, parity and income level. Acculturation was measured by cultural orientation and length of residence in The Netherlands. Data of 1095 Turks and Moroccans were analysed using logistic regression, with overweight/obesity (BMI 25.0) as the dependent variable. Results: The prevalence of overweight/obesity was high (57–89%).

Manuscript I and II correspond to a systematic review of the literature on attitudes toward oral contraceptive (OC) use among women of reproductive age and the relationship of acculturation with contraceptive use patterns among immigrants, respectively. Manuscript III corresponds to the main dissertation study that was conducted to explore the role of acculturation on OC use among Korean immigrant women. It was specifically aimed to explore the effect of acculturation on attitudes, subjective norms, and intention, with regard to OC use in this population. For the most part, manuscript III presents the methodology of this empirical dissertation study, including the design and methods, statistical analysis, and findings. The Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA; Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980), incorporated with the concept of acculturation, provided the theoretical framework for this study. A random sample of 146 Korean immigrant women was selected from the five boroughs (Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island) of the City of New York, based on Korean surname-based telephone lists. Data were collected using a telephone survey interview from September 2006 to February 2007. Participants were asked to respond to demographic and OC use history questionnaires, Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identify Acculturation Scale (SL-ASIA: Suinn, Rickard-Figueroa, Lew, & Vigil, 1987), and Lee's Oral Contraceptive Use Scale (LOCUS) with five subscales. Pearson correlations, multiple regressions, and hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the hypotheses formulated by a modified version of the TRA model. In general, participants reported low to moderate levels of acculturation. Their attitudes toward OC use were slightly positive, whereas normative pressure and intention to use OCs tended to be negative. The results of analysis revealed that acculturation explained some of the variance in attitudes, subjective norms, and intention to use OCs. Women who were moderately acculturated, as opposed to those who were low acculturated, tended to believe that OC use would lead to positive outcomes and evaluated positively the act of using OCs. In turn, these women held a more favorable attitude toward OC use. In addition, the more acculturated women were, the more likely they were to perceive social pressure to and intend to use OCs. Nevertheless, the findings should be carefully interpreted in that only small portions (i.e., 3-6%) of the variances in attitudes, subjective norms, and intention were accounted for by acculturation. This might be due to the low variability in acculturation scores (1.7 to 3.5) obtained in this study. To capture the full scope of acculturation on OC use, future studies must include participants with a broader range of acculturation, including Korean American whose acculturation levels differ substantially from immigrants'.

In contrast, when participants perceived that the public held a favorable view of their ethnic group (e.g., Haitian) they were less likely to engage in African American culture. Furthermore, among participants experiencing low levels of cultural race-related stress, the associations between racial public regard and engagement with African American culture were amplified. However, for participants experiencing high cultural race-related stress, their engagement in African American culture did not change as a function of racial public regard. These findings may suggest that, for Black Caribbean immigrants, the experience of the racial context influences strategies that serve to preserve or bolster their overall social status and psychological well-being in the United States.

This study examines whether health inequities and different social factors exist regarding the health of rural and urban married Asian immigrants. A survey was conducted on 419 rural and 582 urban married Asian immigrants in Taiwan in 2009. Whereas the descriptive results indicate a worse mental health status between rural and urban married Asian immigrants, rural married immigrants were as mentally healthy as urban ones when considering different social variables. An analysis of regional stratification found different social-determinant patterns on rural and urban married immigrants. Whereas social support is key for rural immigrant physical and mental health, acculturation (i.e., language proficiency), socioeconomics (i.e., working status), and family structure (the number of family members and children living in the family) are key to the mental health of urban married immigrants in addition to social support. This study verifies the key roles of social determinants on the subjective health of married Asian immigrants. Area-differential patterns on immigrant health might act as a reference for national authorities to (re)focus their attention toward more area-specific approaches for married Asian immigrants.

Results indicate that assimilation in the least disadvantaged neighborhoods can be protective against poor health. Specifically, more assimilated men and women in the lowest disadvantage neighborhoods have a lower likelihood of self-reported poorer health and being overweight, respectively; no link was found in higher disadvantage neighborhoods. Assimilation was not found to be associated with self-reported health for women or BMI for men, regardless of neighborhood disadvantage level.

Methods: Perinatal data from a project on the influence of migration and acculturation on pregnancy and birth in Berlin was analyzed. An acculturation index (FRAKK) and two proxy measures (German language proficiency, length of stay in Germany) were used. We performed logistic regression models and calculated age-standardized prevalence ratios (SPR). Results: Smoking prevalence was 19.8% among pregnant Turkish women (n = 702) and 17.8% among German women (n = 2,999). The chance of being a smoker was significantly higher among Turkish women with a length of stay of ≥20 years compared to 0–4 years (OR = 3.63, 95% CI = 1.64–8.05); with good/very good language skills compared to none/minor skills; with high levels of acculturation compared to low levels (the latter only among 18–29-year-old women). Compared to German women, Turkish women with a short length of stay, low acculturation scores and none/minor language skills had lower smoking rates. This finding inverts with long length of stay, high acculturation scores and good/very good language skills (≥20 years: SPR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.56–2.94). Conclusions: Smoking among pregnant Turkish women increases with increasing acculturation. Additionally, immigrant women with a low acculturation level are less often smokers and women with a high level are more often smokers than German women. Prevention measures have to prevent women with a low acculturation from starting to smoke and to induce those with a high acculturation to quit. As smoking and acculturation are group phenomena, it is necessary to involve immigrant communities.

'Western' cultural and historical influences have likely contributed to the modus operandi of these disciplines in recent decades, reflected by a shift in focus towards individual-level variables in the absence of situational factors, and internal rather than external validity in research designs. One example is acculturation research, an area that has been extensively critiqued in recent years for methodological shortcomings as well as a lack of attention to context. Community psychology perspectives have begun, remediating this problem, highlighting the relevance of person-environment interactions in understanding adjustment. In line with such thinking, we profile our acculturation research programme with immigrants in Montreal, Canada, which has included both perceived and actual ethnic density as contextual variables. Our results shed light on some of the contrasting findings in both ethnic density and acculturation research literatures by recognizing that the two variables are likely to be closely interwoven. This research has also begun the process of unpacking the mechanisms of ethnic density effects that might act as mental health protective factors in immigrants. Clinical implications are discussed, as well as the mutually dependent nature between psychological and contextual variables. We make the case for greater collaboration between disciplines such as psychology, psychiatric epidemiology, anthropology, neuroscience, and sociology in order to generate more meaningful research.

In the original article, the figure on page 141, the two predictors 'majority group contact' and 'minority group contact' are incorrectly switched. The corrected figure is given in the erratum.] Against the background of contrasting religious versus secular norms in immigrant communities and in Dutch society, this study examines how religious identity expression is related to the social integration of Dutch Muslims within (a) Turkish or Moroccan minority groups and (b) Dutch majority groups. Using nationally representative survey data (N = 2,027), we distinguish religious identification from religious practice (worship and dietary practices) and assertion (support for the role of religion in politics and society) as different forms of religious expression. Structural equation models confirm that minority group contact supports and, conversely, majority group contact suppresses religious practice and assertion. In line with religion as social identity, this result is partly because Dutch Muslims with more minority contacts identify more strongly with their religion, whereas those with more majority contacts identify less strongly. As found in a social capital approach, social integration also directly influences religious expression, especially within the most cohesive Turkish minority group.

While a large body of research already engaged with clarifying this relationship, we know little about the role one’s immigration background plays in moderating this relationship. With respect to this, we explicitly focus on how one’s immigrant status moderates the relationship between social integration and self-reported health. Previous literature has demonstrably shown that the less socially integrated individuals are, the less likely they are to report good health. Moreover, we know from social capital literature that immigrants have difficulties being socially connected in their host country. Methods: With the help of the new MIGHEAL survey, we test this proposed negative relationship. We also compare the results from the MIGHEAL data with findings from the European Social Survey round 7. Our analyses follow a thorough approach testing immigrant background as potential moderating factors. We implement logistic regression models and path analysis to reveal the complex interactive relationship between social integration, immigrant status and self-reported health. Results/Conclusion: Our results suggest that immigrant status does play a moderating role in the relationship between social integration and health. This role, however, is limited to the relationship between social activity and self-reported health, which points to a potential endogenous effect.

Purpose: This study utilized a migration stress model to prospectively investigate the impact of social integration on change in high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), a marker of autonomic functioning. Methods: Sixty new international students were recruited shortly after their arrival in the host country and assessed 2 and 5 months later. At each assessment period, participants provided information on social integration and loneliness and had their resting HF-HRV evaluated. Results: There was an overall decrease in HF-HRV over time. The magnitude of the within-person and between-person effects of social integration on HRV increased over time, such that greater social integration was associated with higher HF-HRV at later follow-ups. Conclusions: These results suggest that altered autonomic functioning might represent a key pathway linking social integration to health outcomes.

This paper aims to identify how these two factors affect the willingness of migrant workers to settle in cities. First, two hypotheses were put forward based on relevant literature and the theory of individual behavior, holding that the migrant workers’ willingness to settle in cities is positively affected by both social integration and mental health. Next, a questionnaire survey was carried out among migrant workers, using 19 observation variables and 3 latent variables. Finally, the structural equation model was introduced to analyze the survey data and validate the hypotheses. The results show that the respondents are very willing to settle in cities, moderately integrated to the local society, and poor in mental health; both social integration and mental health have a significant positive effect on migrant workers’ tendency to settle in cities; migrant workers of different genders and education levels differ greatly in their willingness to settle in cities; the urban integration and mental health of migrant workers can be enhanced by improving their income, work conditions and social security, thereby boosting their willingness to settle in cities. The research findings help to promote the coordinated urban-rural development and guide the rational movement of population.

Methods: Data on 6,084 migrants aged 18–29 years in the 2014 China Migrants Dynamic Survey were analyzed. A conditional process analysis tested hypotheses regarding the influence of social integration on self-rated health, life satisfaction, and mental illness. Perceived stress was tested as a mediator, and the locus of control was tested as a moderator. Results: Social integration negatively related to mental illness (β= -0.10, p < 0.001), and it positively related to self-rated health (β = 0.24, p < 0.001) and life satisfaction (β = 0.14, p < 0.001). Perceived stress had significant mediating effects on the influence of social integration on the dimensions of psychological wellbeing. The locus of control not only moderated the influence of social integration on perceived stress (β = -0.02, p < 0.05), it moderated the influence of perceived stress on the mental illness dimension of psychological wellbeing (β = -0.03, p < 0.001). Limitations: The cross-sectional design impeded the ability to draw causal inferences. Conclusions: Social integration was a key predictor of psychological wellbeing among emerging adult migrants in China. Perceived stress significantly mediated that relationship. The locus of control moderated the indirect effect of social integration on psychological wellbeing by weakening the buffering effect of social integration on perceived stress. Furthermore, the locus of control also buffered the negative effects of perceived stress.

Interviews were conducted with 418 Dominican women. We assessed self-reported PA using standardized measures. Data were collected between July 2010 and July 2012 in New York City. Most women reported no vigorous LTPA or resistance training (74.5 and 73.1 %, respectively); about half (52.1 %) reported no moderate LTPA. After adjusting for sociodemographic factors, occupational physical activities were associated with greater LTPA. Acculturation was not associated with any outcome. Positive family norms about exercise were associated with increased LTPA and resistance training. Family norms may play a critical role in PA and should be included in programs to increase PA among Latina women.

Results underscore the social significance of the workplace and of civic involvement. Those who report ties to other races tend to be 'joiners,' in the broad sense: Involvement in nonreligious groups, socializing with coworkers, and having more friends are robust predictors for all racial groups. These are strongly associated with each other and with higher socioeconomic status, highlighting a powerful class dimension to accessing intergroup ties. But macro-level opportunity for contact (metro-level racial makeup) dominates the variation in friendship exposure patterns for Whites, whereas associations and other 'substructures' are more predictive for minorities. Consistent with immigrant assimilation theory, among minorities, sharing neighborhoods with Whites remains an important--and apparently unique--social marker for the personal relationships of Blacks.

Self-reported life satisfaction has been used to evaluate the immigrants’ integration within their country of residence, as it is commonly employed to estimate the perceived quality of life within a country or a specific social group. Results show that self-reported life satisfaction strongly depends on immigrants’ demographic characteristics and human capital factors, such as age, marital status, current economic situation and perceived financial well-being. ‘Immigration’ variables also play a role in determining life satisfaction, thus proving that conditions at both the origin and destination are important in determining immigrants’ self-reported life satisfaction. In particular, legal status and country of residence play a significant role in defining immigrants’ life satisfaction, thus demonstrating that the rights, resources and restrictions immigrants find within their country of residence determine their subjective experience of integration.

Less research takes an asset approach through an examination of the strengths refugee youth bring to formal schooling and how these assets can be built upon to support academic achievement and cultural adjustment. In this article, we challenge these deficit notions, through examining the everyday spaces inhabited by Sudanese refugee youth living in regional New South Wales, Australia. Our research poses the question: what role do institutions outside school play in supporting Sudanese refugee youth as they move from one culture to another? The question is significant because little research has examined the role played by institutions outside school, e.g., church, youth groups and sporting associations in fostering the social and cultural capital required for refugee youth to integrate within the broader community, and to engage successfully in schooling. Drawing on Bourdieuian concepts of cultural and social capital and habitus, we suggest that religious affiliation enabled the young people to access social capital through 'prosocial and proeducational moral directives' (Barrett, 2010; p. 467). Moreover, religious involvement provided refugee youth with access to socially legitimised forms of cultural capital. These forms of capital shaped the students’ habitus and contributed to school adjustment and achievement. We conclude that future research is needed to examine the role that church and other institutions outside school play in contributing to cultural and academic adjustment.

Furthermore, collective trauma was unrelated to social support perceptions that might have mediated the relation to cultural adaptation. In contrast, personally traumatic experiences (e.g., assault from a familiar other) were related to increased depressive and trauma symptoms, and these relations were mediated by self-reports of encountering unsupportive social interactions.

The nonmigrant adolescents included 157 Anglo-Australian adolescents residing in Australia and 456 Hong Kong-born Chinese adolescents residing in Hong Kong. There were three research questions in this study. First, would there be any differences in the adaptation of Chinese migrant adolescents in different societies of settlement? Second, would migrant adolescents experience more adaptation problems than nonmigrant adolescents? Third, would there be any differences in the adaptation of adolescents in the two societies, Australia and Hong Kong? It was hypothesized that: (1) mainland Chinese migrant adolescents in Hong Kong would experience more adaptation problems than Chinese migrant adolescents in Australia; (2) migrant adolescents would report better adaptation than nonmigrant adolescents; (3) adolescents in Hong Kong would report poorer adaptation than adolescents in Australia. The participants were requested to complete a questionnaire on various adaptation outcome measures including life satisfaction, self-esteem, psychological symptoms, academic satisfaction, and behavior problems. The results indicated that Chinese-Australian adolescents reported better psychological adaptation but Chinese-Hong Kong adolescents reported better sociocultural adaptation. Adolescents resident in Australia reported higher psychological adaptation but lower sociocultural adaptation than those in Hong Kong. Migrant adolescents reported better psychological and sociocultural adaptation than their nonmigrant counterparts. The results were discussed in relation to the social and educational systems of the two societies.

Objectives: Using the data from California Health Interview Survey, we test the hypothesis whether acculturation is associated with recreational computer use among Latino adolescents. Methods: We run linear regressions of the weekly time spent on recreational computer use among Latino adolescents, stratified first by gender and then by age group (12–14 and 15–17 years). Years living in the United States and language at home are used as key variables for acculturation. Results: For all four sub-populations, living in the United States for less than 5 years is significantly associated with fewer hours on recreational computer use, compared with those US-born. Among female adolescents, those who lived in the United States for 10 years or more spent fewer hours on recreational computer use than those US-born. Among adolescents under 15, speaking English only and speaking English plus another language are both significantly associated with more hours on recreational computer use, compared with those who speak a non-English language at home. Conclusion: Educators and health professionals should heed the Latino adolescents’ possible increase in recreational computer use.

The objectives of this paper are to examine the associations between immigrant generational status (IGS), child maltreatment (CM), intimate partner violence (IPV) and acculturation (i.e., the extent to which an individual adopts the values, language and attitudes of a new culture). Methods: The sample was drawn from wave two of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC; n = 34,653), a nationally representative survey of United States (US) residents aged 20 years and older. Logistic regression was used to estimate the associations between IGS, CM history, IPV, and acculturation. Results: Compared to 3rd generation (or later) respondents, 1st generation immigrants were less likely to report a history of sexual (AOR = 0.74, CI0.95 = 0.62, 0.90) and emotional abuse (AOR = 0.69, CI0.95 = 0.55, 0.87), but were more likely to report physical neglect (AOR = 1.30, CI0.95 = 1.11, 1.52). After adjusting for covariates, IGS was not associated with IPV among respondents with or without a CM history. Among those without a CM history, highly acculturated 1st generation immigrants (AOR = 1.07, CI0.95 = 1.01, 1.13) were more likely to report perpetrating IPV, with highly acculturated 3rd generation respondents having lower odds of reporting IPV perpetration (AOR = 0.93, CI0.95 = 0.88–1.00). Conclusion: IGS and acculturation are important factors in CM and IPV. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the influence of IGS, recency of immigration, acculturation and acculturative stress on the experiences and relationship between CM and IPV.

Predictors were contextual variables in terms of the asylum-process, acculturation variables in terms of bicultural identity, and demographic information such as residence-time. Method: Register data and cross-sectional self-report questionnaire data were collected from 895 unaccompanied young refugees (UYRs). They originated in 31 different countries, the majority was from Afghanistan, 82.4% were boys, and average residence-time was 2.5 years. Results: The length of the asylum-process was not associated with depression while heritage identity and residence-time were. Moderating analyses showed that an over-time steady decrease in depression was present for UYRs with a strong heritage identity. The prevalence of depression symptoms dropped from an initial 40%–14% among youth with 10 years of residence. Majority identity had neither direct nor indirect effects on depression. Conclusion: To optimize the psychosocial support offered to unaccompanied refugee minors during transition to stable resettlement, we need more substantial information about the aspects of the asylum-seeking process that increase the risk for mental health problems among them. In the years following resettlement, a strong heritage, but not majority identity was associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms. The findings are discussed in relation to structural barriers to bicultural identity formation and integration embedded in the way psychosocial support and education for these youths are structured, and implication for future research.

Support was obtained for all hypotheses. In particular, evidence was obtained for the continued presence, in the immigrants, of the culture-transmission motive postulated by the theory: the desire to maintain the culture of origin and transmit it to the next generation. Support was also obtained for the hypothesized anchoring of the culture-transmission motive in more basic motives fulfilled by cultural groups, the relative intra- and intergenerational stability of the culture-transmission motive, and its motivating effects for action tendencies and desires that support cultural transmission under the difficult conditions of migration. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the assumption that people have a culture-transmission motive belongs to the folk psychology of sociocultural groups, and that immigrants regard the fulfillment of this desire as a moral right.

Design/methodology/approach: An empirical study is conducted among a sample of 218 immigrants from several West African countries now living in Canada. ANOVA and paired samples t-tests were used to test the research hypotheses. Findings: The results show that the majority of the surveyed West African immigrants fall into one of two acculturation groups: integrated or separated. Although there are no significant differences between these two groups in terms of their perception that a consumer complaint is more likely to be successful in Canada than in their home countries, there are significant differences in their complaining behaviors in Canada and at home. Research limitations/implications: Marketers should be aware that not all immigrants are the same and that market segmentation based on the degree of immigrants’ acculturation might lead to a sound marketing strategy. Practical implications: Caution should be exercised in generalizing the research results to the entire population of West African immigrants in Canada.

Substantial research has concluded that Latino women are more likely than non-Latino women to experience trauma-related symptoms following victimization. In addition, examination of different types of cultural adaptation has found results supporting the idea that maintaining ties with one’s culture of origin may be protective against negative mental health outcomes. The present study evaluates the effect of victimization, immigrant status, and both Anglo and Latino orientation on psychological distress in a national sample of Latino women. Results indicate that along with the total count of victimization experiences, Anglo and/or Latino orientation were strong predictors of all forms of psychological distress. Anglo orientation also functioned as a moderator between victimization and psychological distress measures for anger, dissociation, and anxiety. The results suggest a more nuanced and complex interaction between cultural factors, victimization, and psychological distress.

Questionnaire data were collected twice from 137 immigrant students, first at the upstart in junior high school, and then again a year later (8th and 9th grade). Acculturation was described in positive terms as a developmental process towards gaining competence within more than one sociocultural setting. Perceived discrimination and ethnic identity crisis were included as risk factors in this process. A model of structural relations was tested, which after some modifications demonstrated a close fit to the data. The results supported our suggestions of two indirect paths of effects of acculturation on mental health change: one through culture domain-specific social support and another through self-esteem. Self-esteem was also identified as a mediator of identity crisis. Significant interaction effects between social support and culture competencies were demonstrated in addition to buffer effects of class and family support in relation to identity crisis and discrimination respectively. The study adds to our understanding of positive and negative developmental pathways in multicultural societies.

The Sexual Assault Among Latinas (SALAS) Study surveyed 2,000 adult Latino women who lived in high-density Latino neighborhoods in 2008. The present study reports findings for a subsample of women who were victimized in the United States (n = 568). Immigrant women reported significantly less victimization than U.S.-born Latino women in bivariate analyses. Multivariate models showed that Anglo orientation was associated with greater odds of all forms of victimization, whereas both Latino orientation and being an immigrant were associated with lower odds of all forms of victimization. Latino orientation was more protective for immigrant women than for U.S.-born Latino women with regard to sexual victimization. Among the victimized subsample, being an immigrant, Anglo acculturation, and masculine gender role were associated with a higher victimization count, whereas Latino orientation and religious intensity were associated with a lower victimization count. The findings point to the risk associated with being a U.S. minority, the protective value of Latino cultural maintenance, and the need for services to reach out to Anglo acculturated Latino women.

Furthermore, we investigated immigrants’ host national identity as a moderator of the impact of perceived overqualification on job satisfaction and career satisfaction. We analysed longitudinal online survey data from 124 Italian and Spanish immigrants who migrated to Germany between 2000 and 2014. Regression analyses show that perceived overqualification is negatively associated with job satisfaction six months later. Furthermore, host national identity moderates the association between perceived overqualification and job satisfaction: low overqualification is beneficial for job satisfaction whereas high overqualification is a threat for job satisfaction, especially for immigrants who identify strongly with the host society. We do not find corresponding direct and moderating effects on career satisfaction.

A national online survey was conducted with 1334 migrants in Australia, examining 11 different sources of social support, including family, friends, relationship partner, acquaintances, work colleagues, health professionals, government agencies, community organisations, religious groups, social groups and online groups. We also examined migrants from different cultural groups. All sources of support were significantly associated with mental health, but somewhat differently for the dimensions of distress and flourishing. Flourishing was linked to higher support from all 11 sources, though not for all cultural groups. High psychological distress was linked to lower support only from family, friends, a partner, acquaintances, work colleagues and social groups, and only for some cultural groups. In particular, for distress, there was no link between migrants from Southern Asia and family support, as well as Confucian Asia groups and friend support. Understanding where migrants from different cultural origins draw their support from could help policymakers and support workers improve health and well-being in migrant populations, especially by focusing on sources of support that are linked to lower distress and greater flourishing, as indicated in this study.

Methods: Data were obtained from an observational study of urban pediatric asthma. Dependent variables were children's diagnosed asthma and total (diagnosed plus possible) asthma. Regression models were controlled for caregivers' level of acculturation, education, marital status, depression, life stress, and social support and children's insurance. Results: Caregivers' level of acculturation was associated with children's diagnosed asthma (P = .025) and total asthma (P = .078) in bivariate analyses. In multivariate models, protective effects of caregivers' level of acculturation were mediated by the other covariates. Independent predictors of increased diagnosed asthma included caregivers' life stress (odds ratio [OR] = 1.12, P = .005) and children's insurance, both public (OR = 4.71, P = .009) and private (OR = 2.87, P = .071). Only caregiver's life stress predicted increased total asthma (OR = 1.21, P = .001). Conclusions: The protective effect of caregivers' level of acculturation on diagnosed and total asthma for Mexican American children was mediated by social factors, especially caregivers' life stress. Among acculturation measures, foreign birth was more predictive of disease status than was language use or years in country. Increased acculturation among immigrant groups does not appear to lead to greater asthma risk.

This study examined differences in neuropsychological test performance between non-Armenian, monolingual, Caucasian-American adults (NA) and Americans of Armenian descent (AA), with varying levels of bilingual fluency and several immigration-related factors. Forty bilingual AA (62.5% female) and 43 NA (57.5% female) participants were administered a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests. AAs were subdivided into groups based on their performance on the Wide Range Achievement Test-3 (WRAT-3) reading measure (Wilkinson, 1993; creating low- and high-English Fluency groups), an experimental Armenian version of a word-reading test (creating low- and high-Armenian Fluency groups), and the Marin and Marin Acculturation scales (1991) for Language Preference (creating low- and high-language acculturated groups) and Social Relations (creating low- and high-socially acculturated groups). AAs were also grouped by years of Armenian education, immigration age, and origin of immigration. A factor analysis on the 30 test variables yielded 10 meaningful neuropsychological factors (i.e., Learning, Narrative Memory, Nonverbal Processing, Language, Fluency, Conceptualization, Mental Control, Set-Shifting, Attention, and Processing Speed). The data were analyzed using analysis of covariance for each factor, controlling for age, education, and English Fluency. The Language factor emerged as particularly vulnerable, with poorer performance seen by low-English, low-Armenian, low-language acculturated, low-socially acculturated, late immigrating AAs, as well as AAs with more than six years of Armenian education, compared to NAs. Similar results were seen for Narrative Memory with these groups, though the differences were not as striking as for Language. Poorer performance on Learning was seen by Low Language Acculturated AAs compared to High Language Acculturated AAs and NAs. Three variables emerged as strong predictors of performance on Language, Narrative Memory and Learning factors: English Fluency, Language Acculturation, and Immigration Age. These results suggest that differences can be seen on neuropsychological tests with strong verbal components (e.g., vocabulary, naming, story-memory, and verbal list-learning) in bilingual Caucasian immigrants as compared to monolingual, US-born Caucasian-Americans.

On the social context level, we used the mean prejudice- and acculturation preferences-scores of the German respondents (N = 3,495) as proxies for the intergroup climate within these districts. Results of multilevel path analysis showed that on the context level, a negative intergroup climate (i.e., a higher amount of prejudice of the German respondents within the districts) was related to a stronger desire for cultural maintenance among the immigrants. The potential implications of a hostile intergroup climate for the acculturation process are discussed.

The findings showed that in coming to Canada, women focused on caring for their children and often sacrificed their personal dreams. They had to be employed to support their families, and received support from family and government. Women participated regularly in a Korean Church and drew on their Christian faith to ease their adjustment. They retained hopes for the future including good health and a better life for their children. Most women indicated that it was difficult to integrate into Canadian society but they never gave up on their adjustment to a new culture. In this manuscript, the adjustment experience of the immigrant women is discussed in the context of an acculturation framework.

The process of acculturation and the stress involved in adapting to the host culture and preserving homeland traditions can have a significant impact on the lives of immigrants and their children (Berry, 2003). Studies have shown that acculturation style, that is, the manner in which one acculturates, can affect physical and mental health in immigrant populations (Hans, 2001). The substantial increase in the numbers of Indian Asian immigrants to the U.S. has been described as one of the most significant demographic developments in decades (Durvasula & Mylvaganam, 1994). Despite this growing population, few studies have been conducted specifically on the effects of acculturation and acculturative stress in Indian Asian Americans (Saroop, 2003). As the number of Indian Asians seeking psychological services increases so does the need for research on this population (Saroop, 2003. The current study examined acculturative style and its effect on acculturative stress and individual well being in adult Indian Asians living in the United States. A convenience sample of 53 Asian Indians from a church in the Midwest was recruited for this study. The measures used were the Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identity Scale to assess acculturation strategies, the Acculturation Stress Scale for International Students to assess acculturative stress, and the Satisfaction with Life Scale to assess well-being. The results indicate that 3 acculturation strategy did not have an impact on acculturative stress nor was acculturative stress related to life satisfaction. Limitations of the study included the use of a convenience sample and the small size and homogeneity of the sample. The purpose of the study was to broaden the limited pool of research on this population and in so doing provide empirical support for culturally competent clinical practice and increasing culturally specific mental health policies and resources. Continued research on the impact of acculturation processes on mental health in Indian Asians needs to be conducted with larger more varied samples of Indian Asians.

We find Latino citizens reported better health than non-citizens; however, other acculturation measures, such as language use and time in the U.S. do not have a marked effect. Furthermore, skin color matters only for U.S.-born Latinos. Racialization is therefore important to consider within the context of the Hispanic paradox.

Within foreign-born adults, ultra-processed food consumption increased with English permeation at home from 40% among individuals speaking non-English languages only to 50% among those speaking English only (p for linear trend < 0.001). In addition, ultra-processed food consumption increased from 41% among foreign-born adults who spent less than 30% of their life in the US to 48% among those who lived in the US for more than 50% of their lives (p for linear trend < 0.001). Race/ethnicity emerged as an important effect modifier for the observed associations.

Methods: Between December 2009 and June 2011, we surveyed 439 adult Somalis who had lived in the United States 10 years or less. Assessments included oral examinations with decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) counts and measurement of spoken English and health literacy. We tested associations with generalized linear regression models. Results: Participants had means of 1.4 decayed, 2.8 missing, and 1.3 filled teeth. Among participants who had been in the United States 0 to 4 years, lower health literacy scores correlated with lower DMFT (rate ratio [RR] = 0.78; P = .016). Among participants who had been in the country 5 to 10 years, lower literacy scores correlated with higher DMFT (RR = 1.37; P = .012). Literacy was not significantly associated with decayed teeth. Lower literacy scores correlated marginally with lower risk of periodontal disease (odds ratio = 0.22; P = .047).

The way people adapt to a new country (acculturation) is a complex process in which immigrants’ evaluations about the culture of origin and their perceptions of the host country interact. The combination of these two factors produces four types of acculturation: separation, assimilation, integration, and marginalization. Several variables, such as personality, attitudes, and emotional intelligence, have been studied to help explain this process. However, the impact of a culture of honor and its interaction with other variables remains an open question that may help to explain how migrants can better adjust to their host culture. In this study, we examine the influence of the culture of honor (social) and emotional intelligence (individual) on acculturation. In a sample of 129 Moroccan women (mean age = 29, SD = 9.40) immigrants in Spain (mean time in Spain = 6 years, SD = 3.60), we investigated the relations among the variables of interest. Our results show that no significant differences emerged in the scores given for culture of honor (CH) and the acculturation strategies of the Moroccan immigrant women F(3, 99) = .233; p = .87. However women who preferred the integration strategy scored highest on emotional intelligence (EI), whereas the assimilated immigrants showed the lowest scores for EI F(3, 92) = 4.63; p = .005. Additionally, only in the case of integration does EI mediate between CH and the value given to the immigrant’s own and host cultures (p <.001).

An analogous paradox may exist between foreign-born (FB) and US-born (USB) Latinas. Our goal was to assess differences in LBW in USB Latinas, FB Latinas, and non-Latina Whites in Los Angeles County in 2003 using birth records and survey data. Using logistic regression, we estimated associations between LBW and birthplace/ethnicity in a birth cohort and nested survey responder group and between LBW and acculturation in responders to a follow-up survey. USB Latinas and FB Latinas had a higher prevalence of LBW infants compared to Whites (odds ratio [OR] = 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] = (1.17, 1.53) and OR = 1.32, 95% CI = (1.18, 1.49), respectively); when we adjusted for additional maternal risk factors these point estimates were attenuated, and interval estimates were consistent with a modest positive or inverse association. Among Latinas only, LBW was more common for high-acculturated FB and USB Latinas compared to low-acculturated FB Latinas, and there was limited evidence that environmental or behavior risk factors had less impact in low-acculturated Latinas. In summary, adjusting only for demographics, Latinas in our study were more likely to have LBW infants compared to Whites, in contrast to the Latina paradox hypothesis. Furthermore, adjusting for environmental or behavioral factors attenuated the positive association, but there was little evidence that Latinas had a lower prevalence of LBW regardless of the variables included in the models. Finally, among Latinas, there was limited evidence that associations between known risk factors and LBW were modified by acculturation.

By applying the theory of stress (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984), the model of acculturative stress (e.g., Berry, 2006) and the expectations model (e.g., Black, 1992; Black et al., 1992) to the pre-acculturation stage, it was hypothesized that the potential migrants’ pre-acculturative stress is a result of expectations about future (post-migration) adaptation. These expectations are developed through direct and indirect pre-migration contacts with, as well as knowledge about, the society of immigration. Three types of expectations during the pre-acculturation stage were studied: expected difficulties in socio-cultural adaptation, expected duration of adaptation, and expected discrimination. In line with the hypotheses, experiences of pre-acculturative stress clearly originated from the expectations that potential migrants had regarding their upcoming post-migration adaptation. Also, socioeconomic status, gender, general well-being, self-efficacy, perceived social support, and length of the pre-acculturation stage played important roles in predicting expectations and/or stress among the potential migrants. The study highlights that pre-acculturation is a complex process that begins at the pre-migration stage. It contributes to our understanding of pre-acculturation in general, as well as the factors affecting the formation of pre-acculturative stress among voluntary ethnic migrants.

Guided by hermeneutic phenomenology and conducted by means of surveys and in-depth interviews, it uses a sample of Russian-speaking immigrants in Toronto, Canada, as a case study. The overarching research problem is divided into three research questions (RQ): RQ1: Who are the readers? RQ2: What are the main characteristics of reading behavior and habits of participants after immigration? RQ3: What role does leisure reading play in participants' lives in immigration? Answering RQ1, the study paints demographic and socio-cultural portraits of participants; recreates a variety of contexts shaping their reading; and unfolds their reader histories. In response to RQ2, it traces immediate post-immigration fluctuations in reading behavior; records the most peculiar reading contents; explores participants' self-perceptions as readers; outlines the major areas of post-immigration changes in leisure reading; and presents the analysis of acculturation stress in the area of leisure reading. It is concluded that leisure reading can be a more sensitive indicator of acculturation than more utilitarian measures, because it can open a window to the cultural and psychological intricacies of acculturation. Finally, RQ3 generates a theoretical discussion of the concept of 'the role of reading' and determines the study focus on immigration-specific, emotional and instrumental, roles. Leisure reading is found important in coping with the culture shock; sharing the experience of others and assessing personal immigration paths; re-evaluating the history of the fatherland and gaining a new perspective on the national heritage; stabilizing identity; learning about the new country; improving English-language proficiency; and compensating for the deficiencies of a transitional period. In addition, leisure reading emerges as a powerful force cementing ethnic and transnational reading communities. The study expands the selected acculturation models and theories; introduces clarity to the concepts of the role and appeal of reading; highlights the dual and self-reinforcing function of reading as a measure and a determinant of acculturation. Finally, it presents a systematic examination of the ethnic readership that has escaped the attention of reading researchers in the largest immigrant-receiving countries, Canada and the United States.

Acculturation was significantly related to past year alcohol consumption for Hispanics, past year binge drinking for Asians, and binge drinking days for Asians, such that higher level of acculturation predicted a greater likelihood of alcohol consumption but decreased likelihood of binge drinking and fewer binge drinking days. The results indicate that acculturation may be related to alcohol consumption patterns for older immigrants.

However, research on how social support is sought and used by ethnic minority groups is fairly limited. Considering the large immigrant population in the U.S., particularly in California, the current study attempts to explore variances in the social support and acculturation processes within the Mexican/Mexican-American community of California with the intent to better inform community mental health services provided to immigrant and culturally diverse clients and families. The current study examined survey data from 48 Mexican/Mexican-American adults living in California. Participants' levels of immersion into mainstream U.S. culture were assessed in order to explore the relationship between their acculturation profiles and what types of social support would be sought by participants when coping with five common life stressors. The types of social support consisted of family member, peer, doctor, religious leader, mental health provider, etc. The life stressors entailed: family, significant-other, financial, personal emotional/psychological and work/school-related stressors. There were five similar hypotheses for this study, one for each life stressor. The results supported only the second hypothesis which predicted that levels of immersion into the U.S. would be significantly related with type of social support chosen for significant-other problems such that lower levels of U.S. immersion will be more likely related with Family Member social support, and higher levels of U.S. immersion will be more likely related with other (ie. peer, mental health professional, religious leader and self-reliance) sources of social support. The group who chose family member support had a significantly lower mean U.S. immersion score than did those who chose other kinds of support. However, through exploratory analyses, it was found that this relationship only held for females, not males. Overall, the data showed that participants would initially seek help from a close friend or family member when dealing with the various stressors.

Acculturation has been linked to stress-related psychological disorders such as depression. The present study investigates the relationship between three acculturation domains (everyday life behaviors, wishful orientation/nostos, and ethnic identity) and symptoms of depression in a sample of foreign immigrants living in Athens, Greece. The sample consisted of 317 immigrants who visited two non-governmental organization polyclinics. All participants were interviewed using the Immigrant Acculturation Scale (IAS) and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The results showed that 133 (42%) out of the 317 interviewees were in a depressive state (CES-D>15). The main finding was that high CES-D scores were related to low scores in the IAS Everyday Life and Wishful Orientation factors, while no relationship was found between depressive symptomatology and the IAS Identity factor. Short duration of stay in Greece, lack of steady job, and lack of residence permit were also related to high CES-D scores. In conclusion, adaptation to mainstream culture daily behaviors as well as the wish to integrate with individuals from the mainstream culture and settle permanently in the new country could be seen as part of an adaptive mechanism that protects the individual from experiencing depressive symptomatology.

Acculturation has been shown to be related to higher levels of psychological distress, although it is not clear whether this also holds for depressive and anxiety disorders in Turkish migrants. This study aims to clarify the relationship between acculturation strategies (integration, assimilation, separation and marginalization) and the prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders as well as utilisation of GP care among Turkish migrants. Methods: Existing data from an epidemiological study conducted among Dutch, Turkish and Moroccan inhabitants of Amsterdam were re-examined. Four scales of acculturation strategies were created in combination with the bi-dimensional approach of acculturation by factor analysis. The Lowlands Acculturation Scale and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview were used to assess acculturation and mood and anxiety disorders. Socio-demographic variables, depressive, anxiety and co-morbidity of both disorders and the use of health care services were associated with the four acculturation strategies by means of Chi-Squared and Likelihood tests. Three two-step logistic regression analyses were performed to control for possible, confounding variables. Results: The sample consisted of 210 Turkish migrants. Significant associations were found between the acculturation strategies and age (p < .01), education (p < .01), daily occupation (p < .01) and having a long-term relationship (p = .03). A significant association was found between acculturation strategies and depressive disorders (p = .049): integration was associated with a lower risk of depression, separation with a higher risk. Using the axis separately, participation in Dutch society showed a significant relationship with a decreased risk of depressive, anxiety and co-morbidity of both disorders (OR = .15; 95% CI: .024 - .98). Non-participation showed no significant association. No association was found between the acculturation strategies and uptake of GP care. Conclusions: Turkish migrants who integrate may have a lower risk of developing a depressive disorder. Participation in Dutch culture is associated with a decreased risk of depressive, anxiety and co-morbidity of both disorders. Further research should focus on the assessment of acculturation in the detection of depression.

Method: Correlational research design was used to study the relationship between gender differences in acculturation and marital satisfaction among first-generation Iranian American immigrants (Charles & Mertler, 2002; Creswell, 2012). This design was utilized for two major purposes: (a) to explore whether or not there was a causative linkage between the variables and (b) to predict scores on one variable from research participants' scores on other variables. Subjects for this research study were recruited from Iranian American immigrants residing in southern California, identified themselves as married, first generation Iranian immigrants, and between the ages of 25-60 ( M = 42.5, SD = 9.558). For Hypothesis 1, it was hypothesized that there would be a significant positive correlation between the level of acculturation and marital satisfaction between the CLSI and the ENRICH Marital Satisfaction Scale (EMS; Olson, Fournier, & Druckman, 1983) as measured by Pearson r at the p < 0.05 level. For Hypothesis 2, It was hypothesized that there would be a significant difference in the acculturation levels for the two genders. It was expected that Iranian male immigrants would have a significantly lower score than their female counterparts measured by individual t-tests at p < 0.05. Results: Both hypotheses were supported. Findings showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the CLSI interfamily language usage and reported marriage-satisfaction scores. Participants who reported better communication and acculturation in terms of how they communicated as a family (using both English and Persian) also reported higher levels of marital satisfaction. This supported the theory that better communication led to a higher level of marital satisfaction. Results also indicated that Iranian female immigrants also scored higher than Iranian immigrant males in four of the five CLSI categories, which included (a) extra-family language usage, (b) social affiliations and activities, (c) cultural familiarity and activities, and (d) cultural identification and pride. The results support the notion that Iranian immigrant females are more acculturated than their male counterparts. Furthermore, data from this research revealed that the female participants reported significantly higher levels of education than the male participants. Iranian immigrant women actively seek higher education with the hope of providing a better future for themselves. Through this process, they gain exposure to the new culture's values and traditions. Lastly, findings of this research study showed that education correlated with 4 factors of the CLSI. These factors were (a) extra-family language usage, (b) social affiliations and activities, (c) cultural familiarity and activities, and (d) cultural identification and pride. These correlations showed that education was a strong predictor of the level of acculturation in nonfamily situations. Conclusions: The purpose of this study was to provide insight into the bases of the marital struggles experienced by first-generation Iranian American immigrants in the United States. According to findings, the quality and length of Iranian marriages have been affected as a result of immigration and acculturation (Hanassab, 2006). The research showed that Iranian Americans experienced a higher degree of marital discontentment and dissolution compared to their counterparts living in Iran (Azadarmaki & Bahar, 2006). As a way to begin to understand this dynamic, this study examined the relationship between gender differences in acculturation and marital satisfaction among first-generation Iranian American immigrants.

C.","The role of acculturation attitudes and social support in anxiety and depression of Indian immigrants in Greece.",1,NA,"In the present study, we examined factors that may impact immigrants’ anxiety and depressive symptoms, focusing on the role of acculturation attitudes and social support. The participants of the present study were first generation Indian immigrants residing in Crete, Greece (N = 114). Our first hypothesis was that Indian immigrants will choose two acculturation attitudes, namely integration and separation, as these may enable them maintain certain aspects of their culture of origin given their distinct differences from Greeks in religion, cultural values, and physical appearance. It was also hypothesized that integration and separation will be positively related to social support. Social support was also expected to mediate the negative relationship of separation and integration to anxiety and depression. Furthermore, social support was expected to act protectively for Indian immigrants who chose integration and separation, minimizing the levels of anxiety and depression (i.e., a moderation effect). Using specific measures for anxiety, depression, social support, and acculturation attitudes, the results showed that Indian immigrants report a greater preference for integration and separation. Separation was the only acculturation attitude positively related to social support and negatively to depression through social support from friends and family. Moreover, higher levels of social support seemed to protected immigrants who choose integration from depression and medium and high levels of social support protected immigrants who choose assimilation from anxiety. These findings indicate that both integration and separation are preferred by Indian immigrants in Greece. Moreover, it seems that in the case of Indian immigrants in Greece, separation could be related to more immigrants’ social support than other acculturation attitudes, ending in turn to less depression symptoms. These findings demonstrate that different acculturation attitudes (i.e. assimilation, integration, separation) may have different effects on disbetinct psychological indices. Moreover, immigrants’ social support is a protecting factor in the relationship between acculturation attitudes to anxiety and depression. The present study suggests that the increase of the immigrants’ social networks could prove helpful for their adaptation to the Greek society.

S.",1,NA,"Over 1 million people are admitted into the United States each year with the status of legal permanent residents. Brazilian immigrants in the US are a relatively small population; however, their numbers are growing to approximately 800,000 to 1 million. Among immigrant couples, partners may acculturate using different attitudes and at different paces. Also, acculturation involves changes in many domains, including the perceptions of fairness in the division of family labor, which may have implications for marital quality. The current study aimed to evaluate the relationships among acculturation, sense of fairness of the division of family labor, and marital quality among Brazilian immigrants in the US. An additional purpose of this study was to address this growing and yet under studied population. Results suggest that there is a significant relationship between sense of fairness of the division of family labor and marital quality among Brazilian immigrant married women, in that perceptions of unfairness in the division of labor contribute to decrease marital quality. However, the associations involving acculturation were not confirmed. There are two possible explanations for these non-significant findings. First, it is possible that Brazilian women are more similar to their American counterparts in regards to sense of fairness than previously thought. Therefore, being more or less acculturated would not be predictive of sense of fairness among this particular sample. Second, the findings of the current study also point to the need to look more closely at the instrumentation used to measure acculturation, to review its concept and indicators. It is recommended that instruments measuring acculturation among Brazilian immigrants should be specifically designed to address the uniqueness of this specific population. In addition, acculturation measure should be updated to assess the possibility that remote acculturation may occur by mean of mass communication between geographically separated groups. It is important for counselors who work with Brazilian immigrant couples to be knowledgeable of the demographic realities these couples face (e.g., decreased career mobility and lower rates of domestic help), as well as marital dynamics involving partners sense of fairness with changing expectations of the division of family labor and marital quality.

Berry's acculturation theories suggest that immigrants' mental health can be negatively affected by their experience of biological and psychosocial difficulties related to acculturation. Data from a nationally representative study, the New Immigrant Survey, was utilized to examine how acculturation stress factors can predict depressive symptoms in a sub-Saharan African sample of 669 adults. The collectivistic nature of African culture suggests that family support is a critical element in the acculturation process, but family support was not found to be a predictor of help-seeking behavior. Results indicated that when birth country was controlled for, proficient English language skills and higher education level were predictive of increased help-seeking behavior. Additionally, English language proficiency was negatively associated with depressive symptoms. Findings suggest that proficiency in host country's language serves as a protective factor against depressive symptoms, and English proficiency and higher educational attainment predict greater use of support systems in African immigrants.

In Studies 1-3, dialecticism mediated the effect of BII on psychological adjustment among Hong Kong and Mainland Chinese bicultural individuals. Conclusions: Our findings reveal the deleterious effects of tolerance for contradiction on well-being and differentiate biculturalism patterns of immigration-based and globalization-based acculturation.

Despite a relatively low socio-economic status, immigrant adolescents have been found to have a pattern of adaptation superior to that of national adolescents. Immigrant adolescents' strong sense of family obligations and positive school adjustment have been used to explain these positive adaptation outcomes. Using self-reports in a sample of 277 national adolescents (45.5% female) and a sample of 175 non-western immigrant adolescents (58.9% female), both samples with a mean age of 15 years, it was found that despite a lower socio-economic status, the adaptation of immigrant adolescents was as good as the nationals' adaptation. Immigrant adolescents scored higher on family obligations and school adjustment. Family obligations and school adjustment were found positively related to adaptation outcomes in the national and the immigrant adolescent sample. Findings suggest that, in underprivileged environments, a strong sense of family obligations may help immigrants as well as national adolescents achieve a positive pattern of adaptation.

Bi-dimensional scales, measuring identity and acculturation in the context of ethnic and host cultures, were used and multiple regression analyses were employed to test the association of these measures with immigrants' emotional well-being and satisfaction with immigration. In support of this study's hypotheses, results indicate that most Israeli immigrants present with strong ethnic identity that fits the 'separation' strategy as suggested by the bi-dimensional model (Berry, 1990). In support of previous studies, integrated strategy was associated with greater satisfaction with immigration as compared with separated strategy. Contrary to previous studies, integrated strategy was not associated with emotional well-being when compared to separated strategy. Guilt for leaving the home country was found to be negatively associated with American acculturation, adaptation, and plans to re-emigrate to Israel, and positively associated with level of involvement in ethnic practices. Ethnic identity and level of involvement in ethnic practices were found to moderate the association between American acculturation and adaptation. Findings suggest that Israeli immigrants present with unique challenges in their acculturation process that affect their adaptation to life in the U.S. Specifically, their strong ethnic identity, high level of involvement in ethnic practices, and experiences of guilt for leaving their home country, interfere with their ability to integrate their ethnic and host identities and cultural practices, thus compromising their adaptation to life in the U.S. Findings are further discussed in the context of the bi-dimensional model (Berry, 1990). It is recommended that future studies differentiate between emotional well-being and satisfaction with immigration as separate measures of adaptation. Cross-cultural studies comparing the unique acculturation challenges of different ethnic groups and their experiences of guilt are also recommended.

While the theory has been interpreted in many different ways, we emphasize its implications for the important role of social context: both processes and consequences of assimilation should depend on the local social context in which immigrants are embedded. We derive empirically falsifiable hypotheses about the interaction effects between social context and assimilation on immigrant children’s well-being. We then test the hypotheses using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Our empirical analyses yield two main findings. First, for immigrant adolescents living in non-poverty neighborhoods, we find assimilation to be positively associated with educational achievement and psychological well-being but also positively associated with at-risk behavior. Second, there is little empirical evidence supporting our hypotheses derived from segmented assimilation theory. We interpret these results to mean that future research would be more fruitful focusing on differential processes of assimilation rather than differential consequences of assimilation.

Existing literature indicates that elderly Korean immigrants may experience higher levels of depression than other racial ethnic group elders. The purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate factors that influence depression among older Korean immigrants in Toronto. A total of 148 participants, ages 60 years or older (mean age = 74.01, SD = 8.24), completed face-to-face interviews in Korean language. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted by adding variables in three steps: 1) demographic variables; 2) acculturation variables (years of immigration and English proficiency); and 3) social determinants (social integration variables, physical health, and financial satisfaction). Results showed that acculturation factors were not associated with depression. Instead, social determinants variables, including lower physical health status and lower financial status, living alone, and lower level of social activity, predicted higher level of depressive symptoms, along with lower education. The final regression model explained about 37% of variance of depression in the sample. These results suggest that social determinants, not acculturation, are important factors explaining the levels of depression in Korean immigrant elders living in a metropolitan city in Canada.

The current research investigates the impact of group-related approach and avoidance strategies on the psychological functioning of newcomers in the receiving society. Research in the interpersonal domain has demonstrated that approach strategies have positive effects and avoidance strategies negative effects on people's well-being. We propose that in an intercultural context group-related approach strategies also lead to a higher extent of well-being. Moreover, we expect that people's attitude to contact and (dis)identification account for this effect. As in the interpersonal domain, group-related avoidance strategies are expected to lead to lower well-being. More specifically, we predict that avoidance strategies facilitate disidentification, which, in turn, affects well-being negatively. Moreover, disidentification, being an unsuccessful integration into the group, is predicted to induce stronger achievement effort as a compensation for unsuccessful integration. A longitudinal study with 51 German first-year students in the Netherlands mainly confirmed these predictions. However, the predicted mediation was not found for avoidance strategies. Results are discussed with reference to approach/avoidance literature and acculturation research. The findings underline the importance of early strategy adoption to ensure long-term psychological functioning of migrants in the receiving society.

Furthermore, exposure to traumas is highly prevalent in refugees and strongly associated with mental health outcomes, however, rarely included in investigations of acculturative process of refugees. Method: Using structural equation modelling, this study tested an integrated model of the relationship between traumatic exposure, acculturative stress, host and ethnic cultural orientations and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety symptoms among 138 Bosnian refugees resettled in Australia and Austria. Results: The model showed an overall good fit and noteworthy amount of variance indicating that traumatic exposure is the strongest direct and indirect predictor of PTSD, depression and anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, acculturative stress was identified as a significant risk factor influencing host cultural orientation, mediating the effect of traumatic exposure on all mental health outcomes. Conclusion: Acculturative stress and cultural and social stressors that are related to acculturation need to be addressed alongside provision of effective psychotherapy, especially since they are significant impediments to host cultural orientation and constructive engagement with mental health services in refugees.

Participants were 391 Turkish adults (280 in Bulgaria and 111 in the Netherlands). Results showed that Turkish-Bulgarians were more strongly oriented toward their mainstream culture, whereas Turkish-Dutch showed a stronger orientation toward their Turkish heritage culture. Turkish-Bulgarians reported a lower degree of life satisfaction. A good fit was found for a multigroup path model in which mainstream culture adoption was related to life satisfaction for both groups in the same way. The more stigmatized Turkish-Bulgarian group was more focused on the mainstream culture than the less stigmatized Turkish-Dutch group, contrary to expectations. We conclude that extant acculturation models need to pay more systematic attention to local issues, such as the history of the immigrant group.

We investigated factors associated with ethnic and nativity-related differences in the prevalence of low cardiovascular risk (optimal levels of all major cardiovascular risk factors). Methods: We used logistic regression to estimate differences in likelihood of being low risk (not currently smoking; no diabetes; untreated total cholesterol <200 mg/dL; untreated blood pressure <120/<80; and body mass index <25 kg/m²) among 8693 foreign- and U.S.-born Mexican-American and non-Hispanic White 2003–2008 U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey participants before and after adjustment for socioeconomic, lifestyle, and acculturation-related factors. Results: Foreign-born Mexican-Americans were more likely to be low risk than non-Hispanic Whites after adjustment for all covariates (Odds Ratio [OR]: 1.53; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.00, 2.34). In contrast, U.S.-born Mexican-Americans were less likely to be low risk compared to Whites (OR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.84). Differences between foreign-born and U.S.-born Mexican-Americans were largely attenuated after adjustment for acculturation indicators.

In a web-based survey administered to a convenience sample of South Asian women living in the U.S. (n = 535), information was gathered on experience/exposure to childhood violence; adult intimate partner violence; and adverse health outcomes, including ever suicide ideation/attempt, experiences of quality of life and body esteem in adulthood. Further, an individual’s acculturation levels were measured specifically looking at cultural identity which was guided by Berry’s biculturalism model. This study found that acculturation status is a key factor with respect to childhood verbal, physical, and sexual abuse, as well as body esteem and an individual’s well-being. These results suggest that acculturation plays a key role for childhood violence, as well as key adult health indicators.

Drawing on interviews and questionnaires, this researcher explored (a) how participants described their traditional and American cultural traditions, beliefs, and values, (b) their infant-feeding practices, and (c) how their infant-feeding practices are shaped by adaptations to traditional and American cultures. In this sample, those women who had recently immigrated to the United States were more likely to exclusively use formula. Interviews suggest that American norms of breastfeeding in public, hectic lifestyles in a new country, and lack of cultural knowledge about pumping and storing breast milk influenced 1st- and 1.5-generation participants to exclusively use formula. For 2nd-generation participants, the awkwardness of breastfeeding in public was also cited as an important influence on their decision to use formula. However, quite different from 1st- and 1.5-generation women, 2nd-generation women were more educated and more likely to be employed in less segregated and professional occupations, which exposed them to mothers of different backgrounds who were breastfeeding. This exposure to breastfeeding mothers appeared to influence breastfeeding initiation among 2nd-generation Hmong. This study also found that negative social support from participants’ mothers and mothers-in-law, and positive social support from sisters and sisters-in-law had a strong impact on their infant-feeding decisions. Unlike previous research among Hispanic immigrants, this study revealed that 2nd-generation Hmong immigrants were slightly more likely to include some form of breastfeeding in their infant-feeding method. This study also revealed the importance of social support and the role of the ethnic community in infant-feeding choices. More research is needed, however, to further clarify the relationship between acculturation and social support on breastfeeding initiation and duration among various immigrant populations.

The purpose of this research is to understand and measure the integration experiences of Korean immigrants in Manitoba in terms of their social, political, education and employment domains. The primary theory used in this research is social capital. Theories of acculturation, ethnic economy, power and stratification are also used to situate my research. Data was collected using mixed methods comprising a survey of 260 Korean Canadians living in Winnipeg and qualitative interviews with 12 respondents. The analysis shows, among other things, high levels of racism felt by Korean immigrants in Winnipeg. While this perception and daily encounter of discrimination in the community would impede Korean immigrants’ integration into Canada, there also is a strong will to succeed in the community through accessing existing social capital and a willingness to invest in social capital. The contributions made in the development and operationalization of social capital in terms of willingness to invest and social capital mindset are documented. Several program ideas are offered for policy-makers and future research areas have been identified. The development of a political engagement index provides justification for observations made by the social capital theory and immigrant integration literature.

Retirement migrants are unusual in that many select destinations in less-developed countries, contrary to the general pattern of migration from poor to rich countries in search of jobs, higher incomes and a better standard of life. This study has examined the reasons for retirement migration from the United States (US) to the Lake Chapala area of the Mexican state of Jalisco. A non-random sample of 211 US retirees was surveyed using a self-completion, semi-structured questionnaire that included items about the decision to move to Mexico, the quality of life at the destination, cultural adaptation, and aspects of personal identity, financial security and health-care. Four major reasons for migrating to Mexico were identified: financial circumstances, the natural environment, a sense of community and friendship, and a better quality of life. While the migrations contradict much taken-for-granted and popular knowledge about migration patterns around the world, they have important implications for the ways of life, social relationships and welfare of the most recent cohort of older people.

The study took into account perceived cultural distance variables as well as socio-demographic controls traditionally related to adaptation outcomes among migrants. According to the results, familiarity with the host country (i.e., the number of Finnish friends/relatives in Finland), the openness to change value and perceived value congruence significantly predicted potential migrants’ ASCA.

When these two dimensions are crossed, four ways of acculturating can be distinguished: assimilation, integration, separation, marginalisation. The first goal of this paper is to use other ways of operationalising these two dimensions to discover the resultant variations in the classification of individuals into the four ways of acculturating. The second goal is to see whether these variations in classifying ways of acculturation lead to different relationships with immigrants’ psychological wellbeing. We examine both questions using data from immigrant youth in Montreal and Paris, and conclude that different operationalisations of these two dimensions do yield some important variations in classification. There are also variations across these ways of assessing acculturation attitudes in their relationships with the psychological wellbeing of immigrant youth. Moreover, these variations are amplified when taking into account the society into which immigrant youth have settled. The general conclusions are that it does matter how and where acculturation attitudes are assessed, and that these variations impact the degree of psychological adaptation of immigrant youth.

Specifically, we tested the prediction that well‐being will be compromised when cultural minorities' acculturation preferences are not met by the intergroup and intragroup contact in a new society. Study 1 found that for Polish immigrants (n = 55) acculturation–contact discrepancies were associated with compromised well‐being. Study 2 followed a cohort of international students (n = 106) for a period of two academic years. Results suggested that discrepancies in students' acculturation–contact in their first year had harmful consequences for their well‐being 1 year later. Overall, the two studies show that discrepancies between acculturation preferences and actual contact have negative implications for the psychological adaptation of acculturating individuals.

A population-based study in California.",1,NA,"Background: The purpose of this study was to compare rates of screening mammography among immigrant women in five Asian-American ethnic groups in California, and ascertain the extent to which differences in mammography rates among these groups are attributable to differences in known correlates of cancer screening. Methods: Using 2009 data from the California Health Interview Survey, we compared the rates of mammography among Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese immigrants 40 years and older. To assess the impact of Asian ethnicity on participation in screening, we performed multiple logistic regression analysis with models that progressively adjusted for acculturation, sociodemographic characteristics, access to health care, and breast cancer risk factors, and examined the predicted probabilities of screening after adjusting for these factors. Findings: Participation in screening mammography differed according to ethnicity, with Filipina and Vietnamese Americans having the highest rates and Korean Americans having the lowest rates of lifetime and recent (past 2 years) screening. These differences decreased substantially after adjusting for acculturation, sociodemographic factors, and risk factors of breast cancer, but differences remained, most notably for Korean Americans, who continued to have the lowest predicted probability of screening even after adjustment for these factors. Conclusions: This analysis draws attention to low mammography screening rates among Asian-American immigrants, especially recent immigrants who lack health insurance. Given that their breast cancer incidence is rising with length of stay in the United States, it is important to increase regular mammography screening in these groups.

"1621","Search2021","thesis",2018,"Buckingham, Sara L.","When real diverges from ideal: How person-environment fit impacts Latina/o immigrants' acculturation and psychosocial wellbeing across four states.",1,NA,"Research indicates that immigrant wellbeing depends upon interactions between immigrants' characteristics and goals, and receiving communities' openness and acceptance (e.g., Phinney, Horenezyk, Liebkind, & Vedder, 2001). Still, most of the immigrant acculturation and wellbeing literature remains acontextual, thus limiting understanding of why some immigrants thrive while others struggle. To address these gaps, this study applied the Relative Acculturation Extended Model (RAEM; Navas et al., 2005) to characterize Latina/o immigrants' ideal and real acculturation across life domains in distinct regions of the United States. It then answered two questions unexplained by the model: (1) Why would ideal acculturation differ from real acculturation? and (2) What impact does the divergence of real acculturation from ideal acculturation have on wellbeing? To address these questions, the current study adopted a concurrent explanatory mixed-method approach (Creswell & Plano-Clark, 2007). Four hundred eighty Latina/o immigrants were recruited from two state pairs (i.e., Arizona and New Mexico, Maryland and Virginia), chosen for their demographic characteristics and immigration-related public policies, to participate in survey measures. A subset of participants (n = 73) participated in 12 focus groups. Quantitative data were primarily analyzed through ANOVA and path analyses and qualitative data were analyzed through constructivist grounded theory, informed by the constructs under study. Results indicated that participants wished to and did adopt more of their receiving communities' cultures in peripheral (e.g., work, economics, political systems, social welfare) and intermediate (e.g., social relationships, friendships) life domains than they did in central (e.g., family relationships, religious customs, ways of thinking, principles, values) life domains. Conversely, they wished to and did maintain their cultures in central life domains more than they did in other life domains. They had more difficulties changing and maintaining cultural customs in preferred ways in peripheral domains. Participants in Arizona, and to some degree, Virginia, were less able to make desired cultural changes than participants in Maryland and New Mexico. The proposed socio-ecological model of acculturation fit the data well, explaining why real acculturation may differ from ideal acculturation. A set of personal and contextual factors (i.e., ideal cultural change; quality of contact with, and acculturative preferences and prejudicial attitudes of the receiving community; perceived threat, and immigration-related public policies) predicted Latina/o immigrants' cultural changes, directly and/or indirectly through their sense of community with the receiving community and/or intergroup anxiety. A similar set of factors influenced Latina/o immigrants' cultural maintenance, directly and/or indirectly through their sense of community with the local Latina/o immigrant community. Qualitative data also indicated that personal characteristics, community resources, and information impacted the ways in which Latina/o immigrants changed and maintained their cultures. Finally, the better Latina/o immigrants were able to change and maintain their cultures in desired ways, the better their self-reported wellbeing, in part due to less acculturative stress with the receiving community. In sum, this study provides insight into reasons for the diverse array of Latina/o immigrant acculturation and wellbeing in the United States in light of their disparate contexts, preferences, and experiences.

This study examines whether commonly applied self-assessments of linguistic skills yield results that are similar to those of competence tests and thus whether these self-assessments are valid measures of language proficiency. Analyses of data for immigrant youth reveal moderate correlations between language test scores and two types of self-assessments (general ability estimates and concrete performance estimates) for the participants’ first and second languages. More importantly, multiple regression models using self-assessments and models using test scores yield different results. This finding holds true for a variety of analyses and for both types of self-assessments. Our findings further suggest that self-assessed language skills are systematically biased in certain groups. Subjective measures thus seem to be inadequate estimates of language skills, and future research should use them with caution when research questions pertain to actual language skills rather than self-perceptions.

Forty-seven Central American infant-mother dyads were observed at home during feeding episodes when the infants were four, eight, and twelve months of age and Ainsworth's Strange Situation procedure at twelve months of age. Videotapes of infant-mother interaction were coded for specific behavioral sequences deemed appropriate, responsive, and intrusive in addition to being rated on dimensions of maternal sensitivity. Questionnaires regarding maternal background, stress, and living conditions were administered throughout the study to add descriptive information as well as an explanatory component to the data gathered during the home observations. Acculturation factors such as language skills, financial resources, a stable residence, and informal social support networks were related to maternal stress. Developmental trends reflecting the emerging autonomy of the infant and maternal ceding of control were noted. Regression analyses showed that stress scores predicted sensitivity ratings but were not able to predict sensitive behavioral sequences. Expectations that maternal sensitivity measures would predict the security of infant attachment at twelve months of age were not met. Unlike distributions found among other immigrant samples, attachment classification rates in the current sample mirrored normative distributions; however, a greater proportion of infants were found in the resistant category than in the avoidant category. Key considerations for future use of microbehavioral analysis suggest that while the use of microcodes provides detailed objective information, it may not allow for subjective inferences.
