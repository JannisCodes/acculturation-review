 Much of what we know about acculturation and adaptation suggests that migrants can, and often do, make a successful move to their new society. However, it is obvious that the conditions that affect their adaptation should be those that facilitate rather than interfere with successful adaptations. Most of the conditions identified in this overview are subject to some degree of control by policy makers and health professionals. Hence, in principle, it should be possible to increase the rate of successful adaptations by making appropriate policy choices and by implementing appropriate programmes.",NA,NA,"The process of migrant adaptation has been studied for over half a century

 Two aspects have been conceptually and empirically distinguished by Searle and Ward (1990): psychological adaptation and sociocultural adaptation. These are indicated in Figure 1 and in Figures 3 and 4 (). The former is a set of psychological outcomes, including a clear sense of personal and ethnic identity, good mental health and the general ability to achieve a sense of personal satisfaction in the society of settlement

This paper proposes three qualities that form the bedrock of the multicultural hypothesis: national pride, economic outlook, and the strength of family bonding 
 In summary, this study shall explore using the social markers of acculturation as the outcome of intercultural contact. The markers are the yardsticks to becoming a part of Singapore’s mainstream society while at the same time, it measures the degree of social inclusion. Increased number of markers endorsed reflects a more stringent benchmark in defining naturalization, and hence, a more exclusionary attitude. In line with the model in Fig. 1 and the conceptual propositions derived from the multicultural hypothesis, increased threats will be associated with an exclusionary attitude (i.e., more markers endorsed), but perceived contributions will have the opposite effect (i.e., fewer markers). The link between threats, contributions, and the number of social markers endorsed will be moderated by the degree of socio-economic confidence, defined as the sense of national pride, economic optimism, and the quality of family bonding. Native-born and naturalized immigrants are expected to differ in their response pattern. The former are the custodians in the recipient country whose economic livelihood and cultural identity are affected by intercultural contact in an involuntary manner. The immigrant sample on the other hand, consists of people who relocated voluntarily and are thus likely to experience an improvement in the quality of life from the transition. It is therefore assumed that the impact of threats and contributions will be felt more strongly among the native group (e.g., Birth Citizenship × Threats) and that the moderating effects of socio-economic security will also be more pronounced in this category of respondents (e.g., Birth Citizenship × Threats × National Pride).",NA,NA,"Acculturation refers to changes in attitudes and behaviors arising from first hand contact with members from another ethno-cultural community (Redfield, Linto, & Herskovits, 1936)

 Immigrants face two distinct but related questions pertinent to intercultural transition and adaptation (Berry, 2010): First, how important is it to preserve the identity and characteristics of the original culture? 
 The combination of answers to the two questions yields four acculturation orientations (Integration, Assimilation, Separation, and Marginalization), each representing a different facet and process to intercultural contact. 
 Integration is characterized by a concurrent commitment to both the heritage identity and the dominant culture practiced in the recipient society. 
 Separation attitude reflects the strong desire to maintaining an individual’s heritage of origin but having little or no intention to embrace the culture practiced in the country of settlement. 
 Immigrants who adopt an assimilation attitude prefer to engage recipient culture only. 
 Immigrants who adopt a marginalization attitude display little or no interest in maintaining their native identity, nor a desire to engage members from the dominant group",NA,"The sample consists of 2001 Singapore citizens who were at least 21 years old.

 The data were collected using a quota sampling method controlling for age, gender and ethnicity. 
 The survey was conducted using door-to-door interviews in different residential estates. 
 Only Singapore citizens aged 21 and ago were invited for participation. 
 Age and household income were measured in brackets (e.g., 25–29 years, S$3000–3999); both native and immigrant share the same median age band at 45–49 years old, but the later enjoys a higher median household income (S$5000–5999) compared to the native-born (S$4000–4999)","The data on the social markers were analyzed at two levels: First, the overall percentage of endorsement for each item was tabulated, and segmented by birth citizenship, i.e., native-born versus naturalized immigrants.

 The overall percentage was weighted according to the proportionate representation of each group, followed by separate ratings by each of the two citizen categories. 
 Natives and immigrants differ sharply on the conscription policy for second-generation immigrants with 69% of the native-born expecting second generation immigrants to serve their military obligations but only 43% of naturalized immigrants think this is an important factor (z = 11.71, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.72)","The findings suggest that the new acculturation framework is conceptually different to the bi-cultural model that is commonly adopted in empirical research.

 A MANOVA test comparing the two residential categories found that local-born Singaporeans endorsed significantly more acculturation markers (F(1, 1999) = 198.71, p < .001, partial Á2 = 0.09), rated higher on the quality of family ties (F(1, 1999) = 8.28, p < .01, partial Á2 = 0.004) and perceived more threats (F(1, 1999) = 1409.62, p < .001, partial Á2 = 0.414)

It is complex, in part, because the process involves more than one cul­ ture, in two distinct senses: acculturation phenomena result from contact between two or more cultures, and research on acculturation has to be comparative (like all cross­ cultural psychology) in order to understand variations in psychological outcomes that are the result of cultural variations in the two groups in contact. This complexity has made the reviewing of the field both difficult and selective. The framing of the field (in Figures 2.1 and 2.2) was an attempt to provide a structure that could identify the main features of acculturation phenomena (the ""skeleton"") and into which ill ustrative studies could be inserted (bits of ""flesh""). The questions naturally arise: to what extent are these findings generalizable to other cultures, and what research still needs to be accomplished in order to apply them?",NA,NA,"This chapter presents a set of ideas and a selection of research findings that will allow clinicians to better understand and provide services to people of diverse cultural origins who live together in plural societies. The orientation to these materials is provided from the perspective of cross-cultural psychology, whose central aim has been to demonstrate the influence of cultural factors on the development and display of individual human behavior 
 If culture is such a powerful shaper of behavior, do individuals just continue to act in the new setting as they did in the previous one, do they quickly and change their behavioral repertoire to be more appropriate in the new setting, or is there some more complex pattern of continuity and change in how people go about their lives in the new society? The answer provided by cross-cultural psychology is very clearly supportive of the last of these three alternatives (Berry, 1992) 
 In focusing on how people who have devel­ oped in one cultural context manage to adapt to new contexts that result from migra­ tion, researchers employ the concept of acculturation in two ways: first, to refer to the cultural changes resulting from these group encounters; second, the concept of psychological acculturation is used to refer to the psychological changes and eventual 
 When applied to the specific area of health psychology, a new field of cross-cultural health psychology (Berry, 1994), which can be divided into two related domains, can be envisioned 
 In part, because the process involves more than one cul­ ture, in two distinct senses: acculturation phenomena result from contact between two or more cultures, and research on acculturation has to be comparative in order to understand variations in psychological outcomes that are the result of cultural variations in the two groups in contact",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"In a recent Canadian study, even when age-adjusted, Canadian-born individuals had a 7% higher prevalence of a variety of chronic diseases than did immigrants, but these differences were reduced the longer immigrants had lived in Canada (Statistics Can­ ada, 1996)

 Conclusions and outlook:Overall, we conclude that the prediction of migrant mental health outcomes using Berry’s (1997) model of acculturation is limited. As a consequence, we formulated an alternative acculturation framework which is rooted in health promotion theory (Antonovsky, 1996).We presented a parsimonious model explaining the relationship between migration and mental health, integrating an acculturation and salutogenesis perspective. Focusing on the acculturation strategies, the sense of coherence, and generalized resistance resources, our model is able to better explain the controversial findings in migrant mental health research. Our point is that migration is not per se a negative life event, or a stressor, and that migration processes depend on the individual’s subjective appraisal.:More specifically, we can infer from our model a series of hypotheses with respect to migrant mental health outcomes that can be empirically tested. In this respect, our integrative model is innovative in that it allows for formulating new hypotheses.

 The development of a strong or a weak sense of coherence, respectively, is strongly dependent on the structural, or the socio-cultural context, which in turn determines the individual’s social identity (Tajfel & Turner, 1979) and, in Hofstede’s (1991) terms, programming of the mind. 
 A strong sense of coherence might instigate adequate coping strategies that help a migrant to adapt to this new cultural environment.","The primary objective of this paper is to elaborate a theoretical framework for the understanding of migrant mental health that combines elements from Berry (2006a, 2006b) acculturation model and Antonovsky’s (1987) salutogenic theory, assuming that migration is not inevitably related to mental health problems, and that migration is not, by definition, a risk factor",NA,"Results from hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that acculturative stress, demographic characteristic, sense of coherence, coping strategies and perceived social support emerged as significant predictors of positive wellbeing. 
 Lam (2007) examined the impact of perceived racial discrimination, conceptualized as a life stressor of the acculturation process, on psychological distress, mediated by the sense of coherence among 122 Vietnamese American college students. 
 Having reviewed both the theoretical and empirical contributions to explain the relationship between acculturation and mental health in migrants, the authors suggest an integrative and simpler model. 
 The authors simplify the model by summarizing moderating factors prior to and during the acculturation process as generalized resistance resources and sense of coherence.

Because many immigrants are unaware how acculturative forces can disrupt family communication lines and lead to the development of conflicting family values, educating immigrants about the larger sociocultural forces that set the stage for problems before their development will be necessary if we are to ensure healthy adaptation. Moreover, mental health practitioners need to be responsive to cultural issues that may impact family functioning if they are to provide competent care to immigrant families.

 In conclusion, most traditional acculturation studies have operationalized biculturalism largely as a uniform construct, overlooking individual variations in the way bicultural identity is negotiated and organized (see qualitative studies by Phinney & Devich-Navarro, 1997, and Vivero & Jenkins, 1999, for exceptions). Specifically, the customary assessment of biculturalism in terms of a single score (or set of scores) on traditional acculturation scales seems insufficient for capturing fundamental individual differences in the experiences and meanings associated with bicultural identity. For example, even among acculturating individuals who identify with both mainstream and ethnic cultures, variations in sociocultural (e.g., generational status, cultural makeup of the community), sociocognitive (e.g., personality, attitudes) and socioemotional factors (stress due to discrimination or in-group pressures) leave room for significant individual differences in the process of bicultural identity formation and the meanings associated with this experience.","Limitations and Future:Work:This article represents an initial, exploratory step towards understanding bicultural identity and, as such, our results need to be replicated and our designs refined and expanded in future studies. For instance, because we relied entirely on a single ethnic group—Chinese American, first-generation immigrants—future studies should examine how generalizable our findings are to non-Chinese ethnic groups, who are likely to have different cultural norms, migration histories, and patterns of race relations in the United States. Secondly, we examined only first generation biculturals; thus, future work is needed to see whether BII is relevant to nonimmigrant biculturals, that is, individuals for whom the internalization of two cultures did not involve a physical relocation to the United States. Third, our sample size was somewhat small for the testing of complex models, and, given the exploratory nature of this study, our findings and conclusions should be validated in future studies with larger numbers of participants. Fourth, although our study identified some negative antecedents of low BII (e.g., discrimination, cultural isolation) that are likely to impact biculturals’ overall adjustment, additional work is needed to examine empirically how acculturation stressors and cultural conflict and distance separately and jointly influence overall psychological well-being (e.g., levels of anxious and depressed mood).

 For the purposes of clarity, variables are organized in five domains: Demographic/Acculturation, Acculturation Attitudes, Bicultural Identity Integration, Acculturation Stress, and Personality 
 The above pattern of correlations suggests that: (1) the associations between the pilot Bicultural Identity Integration Scale–Preliminary (BIIS-P) scale and demographic/ acculturation variables reported in Benet-Martınez et al.’s (2002) study were probably driven by the cultural distance component of the BII vignette; (2) perceptions of cultural distance are closely related to traditional acculturation variables; and (3) cultural conflict seems largely independent from these acculturation factors. These results suggest that cultural distance, but not cultural conflict, is related to objective, learning- and performance-based aspects of the acculturation experience

 We identified two distinct and little understood bicultural identity constructs: attitudes regarding the conceptual organization of dual cultures and feelings associated with the emotional process of navigating one’s position within and between each culture, each with largely different personality and sociocultural antecedents","The present study examines the underresearched topic of bicultural identity; we: (1) unpack the construct of Bicultural Identity Integration (BII), or the degree to which a bicultural individual perceives his/her two cultural identities as ‘‘compatible’’ versus ‘‘oppositional,’’ and (2) identify the personality (Big Five) and acculturation predictors of BII. 
 Results indicated that cultural conflict and cultural distance have distinct personality, acculturation, and sociodemographic antecedents. 
 In today’s increasingly diverse and mobile world, growing numbers of individuals have internalized more than one culture and can be described as bicultural or multicultural. 
 The prevalence and importance of multiculturalism or biculturalism has been recently acknowledged by some psychologists (e.g., Hermans & Kempen, 1998; LaFromboise, Coleman, & Gerton, 1993), but the phenomenon has rarely been investigated empirically. the study of multicultural identities has exciting implications","The aim of this article is to examine individual differences in the construction and integration of dual cultural identities and to understand how these differences relate to particular personality dispositions, contextual pressures, and acculturation and demographic variables","The authors' participants were 133 first-generation Chinese American individuals (58 males, 75 females, mean age 5 24.5, SD 5 7.3) residing in a large college town in the Upper Midwest of the United States. 
 This sample included undergraduate students and older members of the university community such as graduate students, visiting scholars, and their spouses. 
 Following procedures similar to those used by Benet-Martınez and her colleagues in previous studies (e.g., Benet-Martınez et al, 2002; Hong et al, 2000), participants were selected for the study if they fulfilled all the following criteria: (a) were born in a Chinese country (People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, or Singapore), (b) had lived in a Chinese country for at least 5 years, (c) had lived in the United States for at least 5 years, and (d) considered themselves bicultural. 
 The authors should note that the somewhat small size of the sample reflects the difficulty of finding ethnically diverse samples of participants in the Midwest who described themselves as ‘‘bicultural’’ and fulfilled all of the other demographic criteria","The first two columns in Table 1 show the means and standard deviations for all the study variables. 
 For the purposes of clarity, variables are organized in five domains: Demographic/Acculturation, Acculturation Attitudes, Bicultural Identity Integration, Acculturation Stress, and Personality. 
 Note that the sample reports the highest levels of acculturation stress in the work and discrimination domains and the least in the linguistic domain.","Cultural and cross-cultural psychology seem to be moving away from an initial focus on cultural differences and dynamics between groups toward an interest in how cultures are negotiated and played out within the individual (Phinney, 1999). 
 This shift calls for complex studies that acknowledge the interplay between personality, cultural, and sociocognitive variables. 
 The present study takes such an approach in trying to understand individual variations in bicultural identity integration (BII). 
 The authors hope the present work brings awareness to the issue that ‘‘biculturalism is a complex and multidimensional phenomenon; there is not just one way of being bicultural.’’ (Phinney & Devich-Navarro, 1997; p. 19)","A key finding in this study is that variations in BII do not define a unitary identity construct, as initially suggested in earlier work (Benet-Martınez et al, 2002)","This pattern underscores competence in the host, majority culture as a key component of BII, further research is necessary to clarify and replicate this finding. 
 Perhaps BII should be conceptualized as a process more than a construct, and cultural distance and conflict may be two important components in this process. Still, until future studies examine BII in larger bicultural samples and with different cultural groups, the independence of cultural conflict and distance (and our proposed reconceptualization of BII) should be interpreted with caution and not be seen as conclusive. 
 Work. This article represents an initial, exploratory step towards understanding bicultural identity and, as such, our results need to be replicated and our designs refined and expanded in future studies. Because we relied entirely on a single ethnic group—Chinese American, first-generation immigrants—future studies should examine how generalizable our findings are to non-Chinese ethnic groups, who are likely to have different cultural norms, migration histories, and patterns of race relations in the United States. We examined only first generation biculturals; future work is needed to see whether BII is relevant to nonimmigrant biculturals, that is, individuals for whom the internalization of two cultures did not involve a physical relocation to the United States. Our sample size was somewhat small for the testing of complex models, and, given the exploratory nature of this study, our findings and conclusions should be validated in future studies with larger numbers of participants. Fourth, our study identified some negative antecedents of low BII (e.g., discrimination, cultural isolation) that are likely to impact biculturals’ overall adjustment, additional work is needed to examine empirically how acculturation stressors and cultural conflict and distance separately and jointly influence overall psychological well-being (e.g., levels of anxious and depressed mood). A new study by Benet-Martınez, Haritatos, and Santana (2004) addresses these three types of limitations by examining BII and its adjustment outcomes in bicultural samples varying in ethnicity and generation status. 
 Future work should explore the behavioral domains associated with biculturals’ feelings of conflict (e.g., clashes in work values, marriage practices, gender roles, etc.), as well as the types of contexts associated with biculturals’ feelings of compartmentalization (e.g., home vs. work, relatives vs. friends, etc.). Given the ongoing controversy over the benefits and costs of identity complexity (Rafaeli-Mor & Steinberg, 2002), future research should examine BII in relation to other well-known structural models of self-concept and identity structure, such as those proposed by Linville (1987), Showers (1992), and Donahue, Robins, Roberts, and John (1993). 
 Such studies would allow for an examination of BII among samples of biculturals older than those in the current study. Further studies are clearly needed to expand and clarify the exact nature of the BII process; the present study makes an important first contribution by proposing and evaluating one possible model that closely fits and helps explain the experiences of identity negotiation among biculturals.","133 first-generation Chinese American individuals","2005"

 It appears that locating a Bourdieusean framework within transnational contexts requires re-examining capital mobilisation and habiti choices of migrants in relation to complex, multi-level field relations, with associated implications for theoretical understanding of migrant career barriers and strategies. 
 Comparing the career trajectories of Turkish women migrants in the UK and Germany, Erel (2010) observes how gender, class, urban-rural divisions and ethnic minority status restricted their access to positions in originating nation fields that permitted accumulation of capitals of value in the host countries, such as proficiency in host country languages, accents, familiarity with cultural practices and social networks for finding desired jobs. 
 They serve as dual frames of reference in their self-assessments of the relative values of their capitals and their conversion potentials within and across originating and host nations, as well as positions that capitals can beget them in respective social hierarchies (Kelly & Lusis, 2006). 
 Proposition 8: Individual migrants reflexively draw on a repertoire of habitus, comprising those from originating and host nations, to subjectively evaluate the values of their capitals and their relative social positions in originating and host fields. 
 Proposition 11: Migrants may take positions in relation to originating, host or both fields, based on the relative values of their capitals and their social positions in those contexts, and may strive to improve those positions by reflexively drawing on their repertoire of habitus. 
 It shows how the devaluation places migrants in lower positions in social hierarchies, from where they find it difficult to negotiate with other actors for better values for their capital or change the rules of the fields, getting locked in the barriers. 
 The authors hope to help future scholars to locate the Bourdieusean framework within a transnational context, by offering an expanded conceptual vocabulary, based on the conceptualisations of transnational contexts from Migration literature (Levitt & Schiller, 2004; Vertovec, 2003) and the concept of strategic action fields by Fligstein and McAdam (2011).","The authors suggest how the power hierarchies within, across and between various originating, host and transnational fields, that form the context for migrants, affect the valuation of migrant capitals.

 Participants were asked to indicate on a 7-point bipolar scale (1 = completely agree, 7 = do not agree at all) the degree to which they accepted the acculturation attitude they imputed to the nondominant group members (‘The author agrees with the attitudes of the Poles (Italians) concerning their life in Germany’).","Acculturation attitudes and expectations Most participants asserted that Germans should allow Poles (95.1%) and Italians (90.8%) to participate completely in German life, while 61.2 percent expected that Poles and 55.6 percent expected that Italians wanted to participate fully in German life, 76 percent of participants supported Polish culture maintenance, while for Italians the percentage was 88.7; 69.5 percent expected that Poles want to live in Germany the way they are used to in their home country, while 82.5 percent expected the same of Italians. 
 Concordance and acceptance of outgroup strategy Of the participants who were asked for their attitudes toward Poles, 38.5 percent were classified as belonging to the consensual level, 24.8 percent to the contact-problematic level, 22.2 percent to the culture-problematic level, and 14.5 percent to the conflictual level. 
 Participants categorized as belonging to the consensual (M = 6.07, SD = 1.24) or to the contact-problematic (M = 5.35, SD = 1.31) or culture-problematic level of concordance (M = 5.71, SD = 1.19) were more likely to accept the expected outgroup strategies than participants assigned to the conflictual level (M = 3.59, SD = 1.90) (t(138) = 8.73, p < .001; t(101) = 5.45, p < .001; t(71) = 5.82, p < .001, respectively)","While the conflictual level was related to higher perceived threat and the consensual level to lower perceived threat, the reversed pattern was found for enrichment 
 This result is compatible with the model and corresponds to results from the reanalysis of the Piontkowski et al (2000) data as described above. 
 The present study did not show differences in the perception of threat or enrichment between the contact- and culture-problematic levels of concordance. 
 Germans and Turks, as investigated in the Piontkowski et al study, differ to a much greater extent in their religious traditions 
 It seems appropriate, in a model of acculturation, to consider actual or perceived cultural differences as a moderating factor for the perception of threat that is experienced on the cultureproblematic level or on the contact-problematic level. 
 Further studies are needed to test whether the distinction between the two levels is relevant and whether empirical support can be found for the theoretical supposition that the intergroup context is a moderating factor in this direction","The correlation coefficients were r(254) = .14, p < .05 for culture maintenance, and r(256) = .23, p < .001 for participation 
 When considering these correlations separately for each target group, only the correlation concerning the participation issue reached significance for the Italian target sample (r(135) = .30, p < .001) 
 The two acculturation dimensions of culture maintenance and contact were moderately correlated (r[263] = .39, p < .001) 
 A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the level of concordance (consensual, contact problematic, culture problematic, conflictual) as independent factor and the acceptance of the expected outgroup strategies as dependent variable showed that the levels of concordance were related to the acceptance of the expected outgroup strategies (F(3, 248) = 28.39, p < .001) 
 Participants categorized as belonging to the consensual (M = 6.07, SD = 1.24) or to the contact-problematic (M = 5.35, SD = 1.31) or culture-problematic level of concordance (M = 5.71, SD = 1.19) were more likely to accept the expected outgroup strategies than participants assigned to the conflictual level (M = 3.59, SD = 1.90) (t(138) = 8.73, p < .001; t(101) = 5.45, p < .001; t(71) = 5.82, p < .001, respectively) 
 Two separate 4x2 ANOVAs with the level of concordance (consensual, contact problematic, culture problematic, conflictual) and the target group (Italians vs. Poles) as independent factors revealed main effects of the target group on perceived threat (F(1, 241) = 5.50, p < .05), and perceived enrichment (F(1, 239) = 9.48, p < .01) 
 The main effects of the level of concordance were significant on perceived threat (F(3, 241) = 22.96, p < .001), as well as on perceived enrichment (F(3, 239) = 13.75, p < .001) 
 Contrast tests (all one-tailed) showed the following pattern: participants on the consensual level of concordance rated Poles and Italians as less threatening (t(137) = Ϫ7.7, p < .001), and more enriching (t(136) = 6.25, p < .001), than did participants on a conflictual level of concordance 
 The t values for the contrasts between the contact-problematic and the conflictual level are t(99) = Ϫ5.26, p < .001 on the threat scale, and t(98) = 3.61, p < .001 on the enrichment scale 
 The t values for the contrasts between the culture-problematic and the conflictual level are t(71) = Ϫ4.39, p < .001 on the threat scale, and t(71) = 4.65, p < .001 on the enrichment scale 
 Most importantly for our purpose, we obtained main effects of the level of concordance in all cases, both for the analyses with the own attitudes as covariates (threat: F(3, 239) = 2.49, p = .06; enrichment: F(3, 237) = 4.43, p < .01), and for the analyses with the perceived attitudes as covariates (threat: F(3, 239) = 21.41, p < .001; enrichment: F(3, 237) = 6.55, p < .001)","Further studies are needed to test whether the distinction between the two levels is relevant and whether empirical support can be found for our theoretical supposition that the intergroup context is a moderating factor in this direction. 
 It seems appropriate to assume that the relationship between concordance and threat is likewise determined by reciprocal influences. In future studies, experimental research must demonstrate whether a causal influence of concordance on threat exists, as the CMA assumes. Other possible explanations, for example, the assumption that perceived threat in an intergroup context influences the degree of perceived concordance in the acculturation attitudes, have to be investigated as well.","124 males","2002"

If individuals show more knowledge of their heritage cultures than they do of the new contact cultures, the model holds that they are less acculturated; similarly, if the persons possess more knowledge of the host cultures, then they are more acculturated. Ethnic loyalty, on the other hand, is dependent on the self-ascribed ethnicity of the individuals, the ethnic group membership of their friends, and preferences for such things as recreational activities.

 A major concern with the four-quadrant categorization of acculturation is that acculturation is conceptualized as a linear process leading to one of four possible outcomes that become fixed over time 
 The quadrant model suggests that the acculturating individuals are necessarily the ones “choosing” their orientation. This simplified perspective suggests that acculturation happens in a contextual vacuum and those who engage in a marginalization or separation strategy are choosing a maladaptive coping strategy 
 She would engage in a separation strategy. Systemic discrimination such as limiting cultural or religious clothing forces individuals to choose between their culture of origin/religion and the dominant culture.

 These theorems can lead to various hypotheses and/or research questions examining the cultural fusion of immigrants in various cultural settings. Considering this theoretical framework, future research into cultural fusion could consider the following broad issues. First, scholars interested in the cultural adaptation and cultural fusion process should continue to explore the use of host and minority/ethnic media by newcomers. Approaching media use research from a cultural fusion perspective (and not just an assimilationist perspective) could provide greater and possibly more realistic insight into newcomer media uses and gratifications (Croucher & Rahmani, 2015). Second, future cultural fusion research should clarify the definition of “functional fitness.” From an assimilationist perspective “functional fitness” is equated with virtually complete assimilation (Kim, 2001). However, from a fusion perspective a newcomer can fuse various aspects/characteristics of minority and host cultures together to “function” in the host culture (Gadamer, 1960/1975; Kramer, 2003). Moreover, as De La Garza and Ono (2015) discussed, the very concept of functional fitness should be carefully scrutinized, as such discourse around fitness implies some immigrants are unfit. Third, and linked to the fusing of cultures, is what aspects/characteristics do newcomers choose to adopt and/or maintain; and why do newcomers choose such particular aspects/characteristics. This line of inquiry could help improve our understanding of the psychological process of fusing with the dominant culture. Fourth, research should consider how the host or dominant culture changes in response to the introduction of the newcomer. While there is extensive research on how newcomers adapt to a host culture, little research considers how the host culture is changed by the newcomer. It is critical in a globalized world to consider the influence of the minority/newcomer on the host.

Fifth, drawing from integrated threat theory (Stephan & Stephan, 1993, 1996), future work should look at the effects of host receptivity and conformity pressure on the cultural fusion process. Limited research has examined the relationship between adaptation, host receptivity, and conformity pressure (Croucher, 2013). More work should explore this relationship, and in light of the current geopolitical situation, in which minorityimmigrant religious groups (such as Muslims) are often the targets of hateful political and social rhetoric (Bowen, 2007). What impact and consequences do such situations have on the cultural fusion process? This is an important question for scholars, communities, and governments to consider. These questions of cultural fusion could be approached via cross-sectional research; or to more accurately understand the fusion process, longitudinal studies would provide better answers.

 Researchers have broadened the traditional line of inquiry about cultural differences in communication styles, norms and values, to concentrate on the definition and prediction of sociocultural adaptation, that is, the ability to “fit in” or negotiate interactive aspects of life in a new cultural milieu 
 Culture learning theory underpins the work by Furnham and Bochner on intercultural encounters, and research by Ward and colleagues, which has expanded the notions of communication competence and effective social interaction to the broader construct of sociocultural adaptation 
 The results revealed two important findings: (i) lack of knowledge about social axioms was a stronger predictor of sociocultural adaptation problems than discrepancies between immigrants and Israelis; and (ii) lack of knowledge about social axioms was a stronger predictor of sociocultural adaptation than lack of knowledge about values

 The relationship between psychological and sociocultural adaptation is stronger in acculturating individuals who are culturally similar, rather than dissimilar, to hosts; it is greater in sedentary groups, compared to groups involved in cross-cultural relocation; it increases over time; and it is stronger in those adopting integrationist and assimilationist strategies of acculturation, compared to the separated and the marginalized (Ward et al.,1998; Ward & Kennedy, 1996; Ward & Rana-Deuba, 1999)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Masgoret (2002) found that background experiences with the language and culture of the host community were significantly related to the degree of sociocultural adaptation in British sojourners who were employed as teachers of English in Spain",NA,"2700 international students","2006"

Although single item measures of cultural maintenance and contact for the classification of integration, separation, assimilation and marginalization have been used previously in acculturation research (Piontkowski, Florack, Hoelker, & Obdrzálek, 2000), multi-item scales are more robust, have greater content validity and less error. It would be worthwhile to examine the utility of single versus multi-item scales in a more systematic fashion in future research.",NA,"In the international arena there is little doubt that John Berry has established himself as the leading acculturation theorist 
 We likewise explore group differences in adaptation arising from acculturation classification methods, but rely on multiple regression with the use of dummy coding to test whether integration predicts better adaptive outcomes than separation, assimilation and marginalization 
 The final section reports the relationships between acculturation and adaptation as a function of the acculturation measurement 
 The mean item responses reveal that immigrants tend to endorse both cultural maintenance and contact, and that contact is seen as significantly more important than adoption of New Zealand culture; t (272) = 10.80, p < 
 The overarching objective was to examine the different classifications of integration, separation, assimilation and marginalization as a function of the core dimensions of acculturation and to explore the associated implications for the relationship between acculturation and adaptation 
 Self-reported ethnic and national cultural orientations exert positive main effects on social functioning; ideal preferences are not significantly related to this adaptive outcome 
 The findings tentatively suggest that measures derived from self-reported acculturation behaviors may be more reliable predictors of adaptation than acculturation attitudes",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Buddhism, Judaism and other religions constituted less than 3% each, although 10.4% of the sample claimed no religion 
 The mean item responses reveal that immigrants tend to endorse both cultural maintenance and contact, and that contact is seen as significantly more important than adoption of New Zealand culture; t (272) = 10.80, p < .001 
 Immigrants also report that their behaviors are more reflective of their ethnic culture than the national culture (t (273) = 10.42, p < .001) and see this as ideal (t (250) = 5.31, p < .001); however, immigrants would like to be more similar to New Zealanders than they actually 
 The relationships between cultural maintenance and contact (r = .19, p < .01) and between real ethnic and national orientations (r = .19, p < .01), while significantly related, are indicative of a small effect size (Cohen, 1992) and point to only 3.2% shared variance 
 A moderate correlation (r = .30, p < .001) was found between ethnic and national culture ideals, and considered in conjunction with the mean scores, both above the scalar mid-point, suggest integration is viewed as optimal 
 Real and ideal measures were highly correlated for both ethnic (r = .72, p < .001) and national (r = .68, p < .001) orientations 
 As might be expected, a medium effect size was found for the correlation between indices of psychological and social adaptation (r = .30, p < .001) 
 Table 3 shows a shift from separation to integration when cultural maintenance is crossed with contact, compared to adoption, and the increase in integration from 61% to 85% is statistically significant (z = 5.48, p < .001) 
 The difference is statistically significant (z = 3.67, p < .005) and supports hypothesis three 
 With respect to life satisfaction, separated, assimilated and marginalized immigrants do as well as their integrated peers when acculturation is defined by cultural maintenance and contact; however, when cultural adoption is used as the second dimension of acculturation, separated immigrants (ˇ = −.220, p < .01) experience lower levels of life satisfaction 
 In the case of social functioning, integrated immigrants fare significantly better than their marginalized peers (ˇ = −. 346, p < .01) when the categories are defined by cultural maintenance and contact, but higher levels of social functioning are found in integrated, compared to separated (ˇ = −.159, p < .05), immigrants when cultural maintenance and adoption operate as the defining criteria 
 Analyses indicate that separated immigrants report lower levels of life satisfaction than their integrated counterparts, whether the classification is based on real (ˇ = −.196, p < .01) or ideal (ˇ = −.265, p < .01) descriptions 
 Marginalized immigrants report lower levels of life satisfaction (ˇ = −.133, p < .05) and poorer social functioning (ˇ = −.188, p < .01), but only in the real condition 
 The findings converge for life satisfaction in that both contact (ˇ = .139, p < .05) and adoption (ˇ = .240, p < .001) predict positive adaptation; neither cultural maintenance nor the interaction the two dimensions do so 
 Cultural adoption exerts a positive influence on social functioning (ˇ = .155, p < .05) while contact interacts with cultural maintenance (ˇ = −.225, p < .01) to predict the adaptive outcome 
 Real national orientation Low functioning, but only when cultural maintenance is low; low slope = .274, t (264) = 3.444, p < .001.6 The graph also suggests that marginalized immigrants are disadvantaged compared to other groups, and this is consistent with the results of the categorical analysis reported in Table 5 
 A stronger national cultural orientation is associated with greater subjective well-being whether arising from real descriptions (ˇ = .333, p < .001) or ideal preferences (ˇ = .312, p < .001) 
 Furthermore, a significant interaction (ˇ = −.323, p < .001) between real ethnic and national orientations was found 
 Only when the national cultural orientation is weak (low slope = .186, t (264) = 3.106, p < .01) 
 Self-reported ethnic and national cultural orientations exert positive main effects on social functioning; ideal preferences are not significantly related to this adaptive outcome","It would be worthwhile to examine the utility of single versus multi-item scales in a more systematic fashion in future research.","88 data","2012"

 A More Expansive Analysis of Transnationalism:This paper has argued that transnationalism is a social process that is both transborder and simultaneously engages two nation-states. I have suggested that the literature on transnational migration has focused mainly on the transborder connections of immigrants to their home countries and has yet to systematically explore simultaneity either theoretically or ethnographically. In fact, what most researchers have referred to as ‘transnationalism’ should more aptly be called ‘transborderism’, since simultaneity is not directly interrogated in most cases. However, because transnational is not the same thing as transborder, the two concepts should not be conflated. If the transborder linkages of immigrants affect only the sending country and do not have a simultaneous impact on the receiving country, we are not really dealing with transnationalism, but simply long-distance or deterritorialised nationalism. Therefore, if we continue to label any social process that takes place across national borders as transnational regardless of its simultaneity, we risk losing what is truly distinctive about transnationalism and merely reducing it to a variant of nationalism. In this sense, simultaneity is what transnationalism is all about.",NA,NA,"The Importance of Simultaneity in Transnational Migration Theory:The development of transnational migration theory, like other new social science paradigms, has followed a predictable pattern 
 Because these transborder ‘social fields’ are embedded in two societies, they enable immigrants to simultaneously affect and influence both the sending and receiving countries. This is the simultaneity aspect of transnationalism. Because of their emphasis on simultaneous participation and dual engagement in two nation-states, Basch, Glick Schiller and Szanton Blanc’s (1994) seminal book, Nations Unbound, emphasised how Haitian and Filipino transmigrants who had settled in the United States and were becoming socially and politically incorporated into the host society were able to remain involved in their home country through their transborder political and social connections 
 This paper argues that transnationalism research needs to go beyond transborder linkages and more extensively theorise the significance of simultaneity

 If a certain amount of upward social mobility in the receiving country is necessary for immigrants to acquire the resources to engage in transborder activities, those who are socio-economically marginalised in the host society may be unable to develop extensive transborder ties with the homeland.2 Likewise, if immigrants are cut off from the home country, their inability to draw on the resources available through their transborder networks may simultaneously make it difficult for them to invest in their incorporation in the host society.",NA,NA,"Simultaneous transnational affiliations with both home and host countries are certainly possible, they seem mainly limited to more-highly skilled and professional immigrants who experience greater social acceptance and less discrimination in the host society because of their higher socio-economic status and better language skills.4 Since identity is based on an individual’s sense of belonging to specific social groups, immigrants who are more socially integrated and have more positive experiences in the host country will identify with it to a greater extent while maintaining their transborder affiliations to their countries of origin. 
 If transnational identities are based on the social incorporation and engagement of immigrants in the sending and receiving countries and if increased socio-economic incorporation in the host society enables greater transborder ties to the homeland, transnational identification with both countries could be positively reinforcing. 
 If socio-economic status enhances the prospects of transnational simultaneity, it indicates that, as unskilled immigrants become more socially mobile over time, a greater number of them will become transnationally active in both the home and host societies. 
 The author has argued that the authors need to more explicitly theorise transnational simultaneity by exploring the relationship between immigrants’ transborder engagement in the country of origin and their social assimilation and incorporation in the host society.","Home- and host-society participation can counteract each other in a zero-sum relationship where immigrants’ transborder ties delay their assimilation to the receiving country or assimilation processes discourage transborder attachments to the homeland, leading to less simultaneity. 
 The analysis of immigrant assimilation and social incorporation is an important component of transnationalism theory.6 Instead of focusing on the study of the various cross-border activities of immigrants, transnational migration theory must become more cognisant of the relative assimilation and incorporation of immigrants in the host society, which affect their transborder engagements but, in turn, are affected by them.",NA,NA,NA,"2012"

 In this chapter, we aimed to use the frameworks of dialogical self theory and the notion of symbolic resources to analyze how two sisters made sense of their experiences as immigrants. Vania, the younger of the two sisters, spoke of a more positive experience of the transition to Jersey in comparison to Ivone. From the dialogical self perspective, we considered the concepts of uncertainty, “I-positions,” and the dialogical strategies used to adapt to the new environment. Drawing from the notion of symbolic resources, we considered the concepts of disruption, the work of transitions, and the use (or non-use) of symbolic resources to support the work of transitions that the sisters experienced in order to restore continuity in the self.:Overall, the analyses indicated that for both sisters, immigration led to a rupture, an experience of discontinuity. On moving to Jersey, both sisters experienced a rupture that manifested itself through the experience of different levels of uncertainty, whereby they lost all that they could take for granted in their lives in Madeira. The sisters’ experiences were illustrative of the unique and personal differences within the experience of uncertainty: Ivone’s uncertainty was intense and therefore became problematic. Ivone’s experience was one of anxiety and insecurity that infiltrated every part of her life: even when she achieved success, the accomplishment was presented as a survival-despite-the-odds rather than a simple achievement. Vania’s experience, on the other hand, prompted development, resourcefulness, and success. An illustrative example of this was the difference in the support required: Rosa, the Portuguese teacher, was available to both girls. Ivone relied on her and her parents to encourage her not to give up. In contrast, Vania did not use Rosa for emotional support but an aid to help her with verbs.",NA,NA,"This chapter will examine two young immigrant sisters’ transitions to life, and their school life in particular, in their new host society

 Ivone indicated that both her English and Portuguese teachers were a big help, as were her parents and the friends she had at school who were Portuguese.

In our view, life domains refer to a set of activities individuals engage in across a cluster of settings around a set of life goals, such as occupational, family, and social relationships. As with settings, activities associated with particular life domains for immigrants are often embedded within different cultural contexts so that the school and occupational domains often involve settings culturally oriented to the mainstream culture, whereas the family domain is oriented toward the heritage culture.

 The authors' ecological approach to acculturation, which the authors call the Ecological Acculturation Framework (EAF), builds on Bronfenbrenner’s (1977) conceptualization of human development as occurring within varied levels of systems, including microsystems in which individuals participate directly—such as home, school, or workplace. 
 The largest system within which the more proximal systems are embedded is the macrosystem, which represents the cultural context that influences other systems at play. 
 The macrosystem of the host society is not the only culture that influences adaptation in specific contexts. 
 The microsystems immigrants participate in vary by culture (Birman and Simon 2014), with some settings being oriented to the host culture, such as the school or workplace, and others to the heritage culture, such as the home.

 Expatriate motives. Based on this review, we conclude that expatriates are motivated: (a) to feel comfortable and free from acculturative stress, both in the moment of interaction and in general, (b) to be clear and consistent with respect to their VABNs and identities important to the self-concept in the face of different and unexpected VABNs encountered, (c) to learn about host nationals, their culture, and how to behave in order to fit in, and (d) to acquire desired goals or outcomes, whether these be tangible goods, recognition, information, or relationship outcomes.:In support of their comprehensiveness, these motives encompass theoretical basic human psychological needs. Sheldon and colleagues (Sheldon, 2011; Sheldon & Houser-Marko, 2001) proposed that deprivation of three basic psychological needs (i.e., competence, belongingness, and autonomy from self-determination theory) creates a motivational force. Here, learning and transactional outcome acquisition (e.g., obtain good performance reviews) relate directly to competence needs, defined in learning-oriented and performance-oriented ways, respectively. Identity management and relational outcome acquisition (e.g., friendship) relate to belongingness needs. Identity management in the form of dissonance reduction and learning how to become self-sufficient in a new culture both relate to autonomy needs.","As with any broad integrative framework, there are limitations of scope and detail born of limited journal space and the need for parsimony. Foremost, this framework omitted realtime reciprocal effects of the host nationals’ behavior within the interaction episodes (cf. Toh & DeNisi, 2005). These interpersonal effects must be modeled in concert with host national intrapersonal changes in order for researchers to fully describe the phenomenology of adjustment interaction episodes. Some findings indicate that we may have underestimated the possible adjustment change that comes from automatic processing of novelty within episodes (Duckworth, Bargh, Garcia, & Chaiken, 2002). This framework did not explore all the interactive ways in which secondary or subconscious motives (e.g., Locke & Latham, 2004) may exert influence on adjustment criterion change (e.g., codifying of changes to cognitive structures while sleeping). There are likely to be other determinants of storing an episode itself in long-term memory not discussed here, such as distinctiveness of information (e.g., Skowronski, Betz, Thompson, & Shannon, 1991). Researchers should address these and other omissions through future revision and extension of this framework.",NA,"Cross-cultural research has traditionally emphasized predicting adjustment, treating it as a level to be achieved more than a change process to be understood and controlled

 A key issue in conceptual writing about ethnic identity has been the role of group identity in the self-concept: does a strong identification with one's ethnic group promote a positive self-concept or self-esteem? Or, is identification with an ethnic group that is held in low regard by the dominant group likely to lower one's self-esteem? is it possible to hold negative views about one's own group and yet feel good about oneself? 
 Attitudes of the majority toward minority ethnic groups have received most attention, it is important to understand how ethnic group members deal with being part of a group that may be disparaged or discriminated against, that must struggle to maintain its own customs and traditions, and that is not well represented in the media, among other problems 
 The task of understanding ethnic identity is complicated by the fact that the uniqueness that distinguishes each group and setting makes it difficult to draw general conclusions across groups

 Does the search for alterity in the experience of the foreign, both attractive and unsettling, sustain a way of being that is open to, sensitive to, the call of conscience? Or are voluntary migrants seeking a means to reduce the uncanny to the ordinary, temporarily conquering it but in so doing reawakening the anxious call back to authenticity? Can we explore homelessness and the unheimlich as the literal search for one’s belonging on earth as well as the metaphoric confrontation with our existential plight? 
 Though I may be overly cautious, at this point there seems insufficient evidence to suggest there is a ‘type of person’ we can refer to as an existential migrant, as though it is an inherited personality variable or trait

These issues and others will be explored in future research and subsequent papers delving into more specific aspects of this phenomenon","The following is a preliminary discussion of research that unexpectedly gave rise to the new concept of ‘existential migration’. 
 Even if the initial motivation for leaving is so apparently straightforward, these relocations may still imply profound personal challenges that are not usually anticipated by the individual and rarely acknowledged in the public domain 
 From this apparent uniformity of economic motivations for voluntary migration, the following research uncovers what appear to be novel and coherently different motivational themes for migration, clearly prioritised by a sub-population of voluntary migrants represented by many of the study’s co-researchers. 
 Though some of these individuals may initially ‘pose’ as economic migrants, their choice to leave their homeland is not primarily motivated by a search for an increased standard of living, nor is it tied closely to career advancement or the desire to earn money to send home to support families. 
 This approach to understanding ‘voluntary migrants’ is valuable and compelling, but it is without the phenomenological foundation that is attempted here and not entirely commensurate with the complexities of lived experience summarised below","The aim of this paper is to offer a new conceptual discernment to assess its value in further thinking about these pivotal life experiences","The study consists of an attempt to gather in-depth descriptors of voluntary migration in order to produce thematic narratives that would generally ‘ring true’ for others who have chosen to leave home to live in a foreign place. 
 The research constellates around semi-structured interviews that were pared down to five fundamental and ambiguous questions, allowing each co-researcher to interpret the question idiosyncratically and take the interview in their own direction, within the confines of the general inquiry into ‘voluntary migration’ and ‘home’. 
 This approach to interviewing attempted to remain consistent with the intention not to obstruct lived reality as it emerged, but to remain as intimate as possible with the co-researcher’s own way of symbolising their individual understandings, as they recalled their experiences of leaving home. 
 Subsequent feedback on the research and a review of comparable research literature supports generalising the themes from the interviews beyond this specific group",NA,"Summary Comments:Though the myriad psychological and psychoanalytic approaches to the subjective may seem alluring, the current research steadfastly maintains an attempt to explore the more abstruse existential realm, attempting to avoid the instigation of yet another array of psychologically-bound theories of maladaptation etc. 
 There could well be a specific style of ‘openness’ that underlies some proclivities to migrate – for example, there could be individuals who are more likely to engage in ‘existential migration’ due to their openness to certain sensitivities or potentials in being 
 This openness may be the outcome of an interaction between their being and their environment, creating a predisposition for this specific response to the dilemmas of existence. 
 It seems possible that even these individuals may eventually settle, while others who were settled may later ‘open up to’ existential migration as a strategy for life 
 It is obviously not primarily an inherited ‘trait’ if it arises and subsides in a variety of people in response to their changing circumstances. 
 The haunting question for the author remains whether it is valuable or even possible to investigate the actual foundation of the ability to have the feeling of being-at-home, not-being-at-home, feeling without a home, feeling homesick...? Why as humans can the authors even feel such things?",NA,"Further research with the sub-group of voluntary migrants to whom I ascribe the process of ‘existential migration’ may offer insights into the under-acknowledged difficulties of cross-cultural contact generally. As the number of people coping privately and individually with these issues increases, there is a growing imperative to understand the underlying existential meaning of intercultural processes generally and the effect these can have on those who choose to experience them. There is a corresponding need to explore the subsequent experiences of those who eventually attempt to return ‘home’: is it possible to resettle in an environment that was once deeply familiar but subsequently, due to inevitable changes in migrant and origin, unfamiliar? An existential analysis of voluntary migration may offer insights into the tensions between human existence and the ubiquitous malaise of our ‘postmodern’ world. It may be that through global capitalism our contemporary world is offering increasing opportunities to experience the ‘unheimlich’ undercurrent of the world (the conflation of strangeness and familiarity), and if so, this is an unintended side effect of globalisation, a potentially undermining one in that the intrusion of ‘the unheimlich’ may subvert the conventional unreflective attitudes sustaining capitalist economic life.

 In conclusion, this article describes a process of gathering and analyzing ethnographic evidence derived from multifamily groups with refugee families that can assist in developing socially and culturally specific family-focused preventive interventions. It demonstrates that intervention sites may provide a rich source of ethnographic evidence and that computer software methods of analysis and the grounded-theory approach provide a feasible means for handling that evidence in a disciplined and systematic manner (Muhr, I997; Strauss & Corbin, 1998). It is important to underline that the evidence that is needed focuses not on issues of cultural difference (i.e., isolating ethnicity from other contextual factors) but on the broader range of social and cultural interactions that impact on refugee families. The need for such methods is driven by the requirements of translating and retranslating interventions to new settings and new populations. Last, whether this study approach succeeds in improving interventions' social and cultural specificity must itself be evaluated through further testing of the intervention's effectiveness.","There are several limitations to this study. Because the sample consisted of families who chose to attend the intervention, it is not a representative sample of all Bosnian refugee families in Chicago. Nonetheless, this is a demographically heterogeneous group of families. The qualitative evidence gathered in the meetings was likely influenced by the context of the CAFES groups and by the attention of the note takers, who were Bosnian and American members of the team. However, the family members' statements are consistent with other ethnographic and clinical observations as well as with life experience of the Bosnian members of the research team. Also, because some of the notes from the group meetings were translated from Bosnian to English, there was the possibility of misunderstandings due to translation, although those doing the translations had more than 3 years experience on our Bosnian American services research team. Because one person (Stevan Weine) did the coding, an important limitation is that reliabilities were not calculated. The possibilities for researcher biases in coding were lessened given that this coding scheme was based on a coding scheme used in a prior ethnographic study of CAFES that was devised by Stevan Weine with another researcher through a consensus procedure. Moreover, multiple members of the team reviewed and contributed to the interpretation of the coded material. The theoretical framework and specific constructs outlined in this text are working propositions that may be subject to alternative explanations. Thus, it is important to conduct further research that tests these findings, either in future CAFES groups or other ethnographic/qualitative studies or with quantitative data.",NA,"To assist in designing socially and culturally specific preventive interventions for refugee youths and families, this study identified the processes by which refugee families adapt and apply family beliefs concerning youths

 Some were drawn to traveling, even back to Bosnia-Herzegovina. This investigation of Bosnian refugee families in the Youth Coffee and Family Education and Support (CAFES) multifamily group intervention has described several processes through which refugee families adapt and apply family beliefs concerning youths. These processes are consistent with the literature on other refugee and immigrant groups 
 Bosnian families expressed beliefs of obliging family and living through children that are commonly described in studies of the first and second generations from several different refugee and immigrant populations (Caplan, Choy, & Whitmore, 1991; Fuligni & Yoshikawa, 2004; Portes & Rumbaut, 2001; Suarez-Orozco & Suarez-Orozco, 2001; Zhou & Bankston, 1998)

The processes identified in the family beliefs framework reflect beliefs that were evident among multiple family members across multiple families. The family beliefs framework also reflects important differences that the analysis found among family members (especially parents vs. teens) and among families.:Family Beliefs on Youth ■ Obliging family • Keeping tradition • Working hard:• Living through children:Homeland Factors • Our Traditions • Family:Togetherness • War Memories ◊:Refuge Factors • Economic opportunities • American culture • Disappointing schools:Adapting Family Beliefs Parents In tune On guard:Adapting Family Beliefs Youth Exploring:Responsibly Troubled Wounded c=) c=)","This investigation of Bosnian refugee families in the Youth CAFES multifamily group intervention has described several processes through which refugee families adapt and apply family beliefs concerning youths. 
 Bosnian families expressed beliefs of obliging family and living through children that are commonly described in studies of the first and second generations from several different refugee and immigrant populations (Caplan, Choy, & Whitmore, 1991; Fuligni & Yoshikawa, 2004; Portes & Rumbaut, 2001; Suarez-Orozco & Suarez-Orozco, 2001; Zhou & Bankston, 1998). 
 They spoke of struggling over how to live with traumatic memories, as has been described in studies of families of Holocaust survivors and other refugee families (Danieli, 1998). 
 Having a more nuanced picture of how traumas and transitions interact in refugee families and impact refugee youths may help researchers to develop preventive interventions that offer a better fit with the refugees' daily realities","Twenty-one out of 29 families (72%) invited to Youth CAFES chose to attend the groups

 In order to avoid creating over-simplifying and homogenising constructions based solely on ethnic group membership, Marcelo and Carola Suarez-Orozco (2000: 21) call for an interdisciplinary approach to research on the school performance of second-generation immigrants, and claim that ‘single-factor studies seem doomed to reduce extremely complex processes to disciplinary cliches’. 
 They have developed a complex, multi-level conceptual framework to illustrate the complexity of the phenomenon.

 The need for culturally appropriate assessment and interventions is increasingly apparent as societies become more culturally diverse. Individual differences in acculturation can be measured at different levels of generality and specificity depending upon the purpose of the assessment. At a relatively broad level, the one-statement measure can be applied as a domain-independent, overall rating of acculturation. For a more detailed and comprehensive assessment of an individual’s acculturation, the use of the two-statement measurement method with separate scales for a set of domains is useful. At a more specific level, acculturation can be measured in various concrete situations (e.g., at home with children, in shops, with friends) and life domains (e.g., childrearing practices, eating, social contacts).

 Our study’s discoveries shed light on the distinct adaptation experiences of cross-regime migrants.

Generalizability is a particular concern. Cultural distance, the extent the society of origin differs from the host society, is known to affect adaptation (Babiker, Cox, & Miller, Number of interviewees 1~3 16~:Length of stay in South Korea (year):Integration Compliance Resistance:1980). Because the two Koreas share language, history, and ethnicity, North Korean escapees in South Korea may experience somewhat less cultural distance than other cross-regime immigrants, e.g., from Cuba or Vietnam to the United States (Eckstein & Berg, 2009; Hauff & Vaglum, 1993). Future research on work adaptation should test whether cultural distance (e.g., language and cultural skills) might impact development of personal goals or appraisal of opportunities or threats. Second, our sample of 21 North Korean escapees is a fairly diverse and representative set of employed cross-regime migrants in South Korea, but unemployed escapees were not included. Future research should investigate whether differences in the adaptation process or experience is connected with current employment status. Third, politically motivated escapees in our study were all of higher social status; loss of that status appears to be one of major factors in their failure to adapt well. Other cross-regime migrants escaping for political reasons (e.g., avoiding a political purge) may have different and more diverse standings in their heritage society. The dynamics we observe regarding political escapees should be compared with those from other countries (e.g., from China to the West) to better specify generalizable and context-specific dynamics.

 The hypothesis presented in this paper offers an explanation of adjustment from a perspective of cognitive and motivational psychology; it has gained empirical support in some crucial aspects (Torbiorn, 1982) 
 Level(s) of mere adequacy appears as a horizontal line proceeding from the mid-point of the vertical axis; it indicates the minimum extents of applicability and of clarity that the person must attain in order to experience his situation, or some aspect of it, as barely adequate or minimally satisfactory 
 Applicability and clarity may continue to improve toward optimum levels, but at the point in time when both are above their levels of mere adequacy, the person can be regarded as reasonably well adjusted to the environment that formerly was completely new and different 
 Clarity still begins well above the level of mere adequacy, for it is highly unlikely that any type of training could begin with a trainee who is mentally secure and reduce him to the point where he did not even feel minimally confident about his world view. (We are ignoring the question of whether brainwashing or similar heavyhanded techniques could break down a person’s mental frame of reference; ethical considerations prevent intercultural trainers from considering the use of such techniques.) 
 Lowering the level of mere adequacy for clarity means in practice that each trainee becomes less disturbed by the occurrence of ambiguity in his or her mental frame of reference","Cornelius tie Grove and Ingemar Torbib’rn been thinking of its relevance to training.

Person C may not feel that a situation is basically satisfactory unless her behavior is uniformly congruent with the recommendations being offered by the many disparate elements within her frame of reference. 
 Person D may be much less concerned about maintaining behavior that is fully consistent with her frame of reference, D’s level of mere adequacy with respect to clarity is lower than c’s. 
 Applicability and clarity may continue to improve toward optimum levels, but at the point in time when both are above their levels of mere adequacy, the person can be regarded as reasonably well adjusted to the environment that formerly was completely new and different. 
 2. The slope of the applicability line is steeper during the early stages of the adjustment cycle, illustrating that intercultural training has managed to increase the rate at which the newcomer learns new behaviors through his or her observation of, and participation with, host nationals in their daily lives. 
 Clarity still begins well above the level of mere adequacy, for it is highly unlikely that any type of training could begin with a trainee who is mentally secure and reduce him to the point where he did not even feel minimally confident about his world view. 
 Lowering the level of mere adequacy for applicability means in practice that each trainee becomes less determined that his or her behavior be consistent with that of others in the new environment. 
 The situational factors present in an unfamiliar cultural context are powerful and complex, and to the extent that the newcomer can attribute his or her behavioral inadequacies to these rather than to supposed personal deficiencies, the objective of lowering the level of mere adequacy for applicability will have been realized to a considerable","Lowering the level of mere adequacy for clarity means in practice that each trainee becomes less disturbed by the occurrence of ambiguity in his or her mental frame of reference.

 At the fundamental point of contact, on the level of the individual relationship we need to ask, what types of relationships characterize the various stages of intercultural adjustment, and how are social network structures related to the resources to which the adjusted person has access? What inuence do the structure and composition of an expatriate's social network have on the relational content or the exchange relationships that develop? Are there common transitive relationships that facilitate adjustment? Third, using existing knowledge of ethnic-speci®c social networks, research is needed on intercultural social networks that explores the interaction of those cross-culturally derived structural properties",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wellman found that only 20% of the networks studied had a density of greater than 0.5, and those that did were likely to be comprised largely of kin

From a liminality as process perspective at the micro level, the model specifies refugee’s psychological and social capital as theoretical underpinnings that directly influences refugees’ personal develop- ment and resources (Beech, 2011) that helps with their integration into their respective jobs and workplace. However, in the model, we argue that such success is contingent on the organisation. From a liminality as process perspective at the meso level, the model identifies firms’ diversity and inclusivity climate, cultural intelligence and ambidextrous HR architecture as imperative firm‐level factors (Hansen et al., 2019). Specifically, diversity and inclusivity climate is the capacity and cultural intelligence is the capability that stimulates firms to design and implement an ambidextrous HR architecture that enables both its refugee and non‐refugee workforce to work effectively and cohesively for the long term. The notion of an ambidextrous HR architecture is theoretically underpinned by literature on the flexible firm (Atkinson, 1984), HR architecture (Kang et al., 2007) and organ- isational ambidexterity (Gibson & Birkinshaw, 2004). We also denote in the model that boundary conditions are crucial in enhancing the prognostic accuracy of the model (Szkudlarek et al., 2019).

 Sustainable workplace integration of refugees has two key dimensions: the job (time‐sensitivity in gaining employment and optimum level of employment) and the workplace (longevity in employment with an organisation and assimilation into the workplace with other colleagues). In the case of refugees, such meaningful employment denotes being able to find a job quickly and being able to stay in the job for a substantial amount of time, as this enables refugees to take care of their families and start a new productive life for themselves. Supporting refugees to integrate into the workplace is not only essential for refugees themselves and their immediate communities, but it also allows organisations and countries to benefit from their human capital. However, liminality is a pervasive challenge to refugees. The liminality‐based conceptual model highlights both challenges and potential solutions.

While the theoretical model centres on an ambidextrous HR architecture, this is only one dimension of HRM.

 Research Question This study addressed the research question: “How do Latinas immigrating to Suffolk County, New York experience the process of acculturation?” I set out to explore their lives prior to migration, the process of relocating, and their lived experiences in the host culture 
 Concluding Statement This study provided insight into a vulnerable population that has been underrepresented in social work research 
 Latina immigrants have been oppressed on the basis of their gender as well as their ethnicity, and that oppression has come from within their own culture in addition to the prejudice and discrimination experienced from without 
 As a qualitative, grounded theory study using the lived experiences of Latina immigrants in Suffolk County to develop a model of acculturation that expands on findings by such researchers as Berry and Cohen, this model reflects the perceptions and realities of the participants and depicts trajectory of successful and unsuccessful acculturation from the perspectives of the participants 
 The level of success in acculturation comes from a series of choices and decisions made by the individual and her own sense of autonomy, starting with the decision to leave her country of origin","This study examines the process of acculturation for female Latina immigrants in Suffolk County, New York. 
 Thirty in-depth audiotaped interviews were conducted with adult women who were born in Mexico, El Salvador, or Ecuador and a theoretical model for acculturation was constructed using grounded theory methodology. 
 The model reflects the lived experiences and perceptions of the participants 
 It provides a number of factors involved in the acculturative process and attainment of acculturative goals for the participants. 
 Implications are provided for social work theory, practice, research, and public policy","The purpose of the study is to understand of the process by and the degree to which the participants and the host culture successfully or unsuccessfully acculturated to each other.","Sampling Methods and Participant Recruitment:The proposed number of participants was 40, a number generally accepted for a qualitative research study (Berg, 2008). 
 Exclusionary criteria were: male, under the age of 18, currently living outside of Suffolk County, and born somewhere other than Mexico, El Salvador, or Ecuador 
 This is considered “purposive sampling,” which is appropriate when trying to reach a specialized population that is difficult to reach, such as immigrants (Kreuger & Lawrence, 2006). 
 Purposive sampling is a method in which participants are selected with a specific purpose in mind 
 It is most appropriate when the researcher intends to identify cases for an in-depth investigation, when the purpose is not to generalize to the larger population but rather to gain a deeper understanding of a particular phenomenon or type of person (Kreuger & Lawrence, 2006)",NA,"This study provided insight into a vulnerable population that has been underrepresented in social work research. 
 Latina immigrants have been oppressed on the basis of their gender as well as their ethnicity, and that oppression has come from within their own culture in addition to the prejudice and discrimination experienced from without.

 In the study by Cosby et al (2012), ethnic prejudice and the societal perception of economic competition were found to be significantly related to support for deportation in the face of alternative legal options","Existing theories do not take into account the influence of strengths, resilience, or intangible resources of immigrant populations. In understanding the experiences of Latina immigrants acclimating to a diverse and densely populated demographic region, I have developed an updated theory on acculturation for use in future studies. I have identified implications for future research, social work education, social work practice, and policy. 
 Additional studies supporting the trend of family alienation, family stress, and generational gaps were conducted by Chao and Otsuki-Clutter (2011) and Smokowski et al (2008), both of which describe bicultural confusion and conflict related to differing levels of, and prioritizing of, acculturation. In both studies, these factors corresponded to varying levels of cohesiveness and alienation between immigrant generations, often resulting in maladaptive behaviors by the younger generations in their efforts to fully assimilate to the host culture. While this was a qualitative, in-depth study, it was focused only on youth and adolescents engaging in deviant behavior. 
 This study offers a number of implications for theory, social work education, practice, future research, and policy. It contributes to the building of theories, as well as the ongoing professional discourse around oppression of vulnerable populations and social justice. The emergent model of the model of acculturation of Latina immigrants identifies specific factors involved in that process as well as provides insight into the contexts in which women in this population make choices that impact their lived experiences in a new culture. In consideration of the “goals” of successful acculturation as previously discussed, I assessed, based on the experiences related by participants, whether they were “successful” or “unsuccessful” in the fulfillment of those goals. The degree of success was shown to be dependent on their perspectives of their experience in their nations of origin, the experience of immigration itself, and the experience of their lives in the host nation, all in the context of the individuals’ acculturative goals for themselves and their sense of autonomy and locus of control. It adds necessary empirically-based knowledge to a critical topic for social work, in which there is a significant gap in knowledge. 
 Wallace and Bartlett (2012) identify Latina females as a vulnerable population in need of further study, and outline some of the sociocultural barriers to recruiting these individuals for research participation and strategies for overcoming barriers. These strategies are building trust, building familiarity and visibility, use of racially and culturally similar researchers, understanding the environmental context, and convenience. They identify as a definitive barrier the presence of machismo within the Latino culture and the impact that patriarchal upbringing has on the recruitment of women for research. 
 Several women in my study mentioned before the interview that their husbands or brothers had not wanted them to participate. The reactions of Latina immigrants to my recruitment methods, and the supporting literature on difficulty in recruiting participants from this cultural population, indicate that additional studies should be done to develop more efficient research methods for recruiting members of immigrant sub-populations, who are currently underrepresented in the knowledge base of social work research. 
 The findings from this study point to a number of implications for social work and professional education, future research directions and modification of methodology, and public policy. Any improvements in these areas would have a positive impact on the Latina immigrant population, as well as the larger immigrant community as a whole. On a personal note, I felt fortunate and honored that the women who chose to participate in my study were willing to put aside culturally-ingrained feelings of distrust for outsiders and meet with me to tell their stories. I consider it a privilege to be a part of empowering social work research and to help these women give voice to their experiences adapting to the culture in Suffolk County. This 38-year-old woman from Mexico can best verbalize the role of choice and autonomy for women who have come to live in the United States: Women are free here, and some do bad things with that freedom. Some do good things. I just want to live my life, and be a good wife and mother, 15 3 and take care of my family, and be happy and healthy. Other women have to do what is right for them, and if they are happy, that is the most important thing.","30 participants","2014"

 TOWARDS AN EMPIRICAL VERIFICATION:Researchers in the field of contemporary migration studies are striving to understand the multi-faceted and complex nature of acculturation. This proposed expansion of the Berry model of acculturation includes the community of co-migrants as a distinct referent. This addition yields a more sophisticated typology, particularly applicable to the case of migration. The apparently paradoxical results in research conducted based on the Berry model (i.e., Koch, et al, 2004) may, in part, stem from the unrecognized co-existence of two types of relationships with the community of co-migrants subsumed in each of Berry’s four categories. The community of co-migrants has a significant impact on the individual migrant’s acculturation process, as well as influencing the host culture and the home culture, particularly in cases of mass migration. As with the referents of the home and host culture, attitudes towards the co-migrant community may be positive or negative.",NA,NA,"An expanded typology is presented representing positive or negative attitudes toward each referent 
 The Berry (1976, 1984, 1990, 1997, 2001) typology of acculturation defines four strategies that may be used to negotiate the meeting between an ethnocultural group and the larger society, and four parallel ways in which a society may respond to ethnocultural groups living within its midst (Figure 1) 
 Numerous researchers have used the Berry model to explore the issue of acculturation, but those who have tried to empirically verify the model have met with mixed results 
 I propose that the empirical applicability of the model to the case of migrant groups may be improved by expanding the typology to explicitly recognize the community of co-migrants and the migrants’ home culture as distinct referents

 Type B, titled ‘‘group nostalgic insulation’’ refers to migrants with negative attitudes towards the culture of the host country, who maintain a nostalgic preference for the home culture, and have a positive relationship with the community of co-migrants. 
 While these examples reflect class differences, the migrants’ attitudes towards class are a part of the home country culture, which impact the experience of migration, in terms of interaction with co-migrants. 
 Type G, ‘‘assimilation’’ refers to migrants with negative attitudes towards the country of origin and the community of co-migrants, with positive attitudes only towards the new culture of the host country. 
 The community of co-migrants has a significant impact on the individual migrant’s acculturation process, as well as influencing the host culture and the home culture, in cases of mass migration. 
 Examples which illustrate the various types of acculturation strategies, including positive versus negative attitudes towards the community of co-migrants, were found in the existing literature. 
 The proposed model defines the various attitudes of the migrant towards the community of co-migrants, enabling researchers in the field to more explicitly consider the role of this important referent in studies of this global phenomenon.","Geertz (1973: 89) defines the concept of ‘‘culture’’ as ‘‘...an historically transmitted pattern of meanings embodied in symbols, a system of inherited conceptions expressed in symbolic forms by means of which men communicate, perpetuate and develop their knowledge about and attitudes towards life.’’ Barth’s pivotal definition of ethnic groups emphasizes ascription and social organization over the cultural content of groups, writing, ‘‘...categorical ethnic distinctions do not depend on an absence of mobility, contact and information, but do entail social processes of exclusion and incorporation whereby discrete categories are maintained despite changing participation and membership in the course of individual life histories,’’ (Barth, 1969: 9).

Many White Americans do not view themselves as members of an ethnic group (L. Rodriguez et al, 2010; Schildkraut, 2007).

In this sense, the model is best regarded as exploratory, with further investigation required. In the future, the proposed model should be tested, and confirmation sought, using other samples of immigrants. The model should be tested with a broader range of education to compare the potential impact of level of education of the present sample on the outcome variables of the model. This would be an important step in assuring the contribution of the present model to the acculturation processes literature. 
 A measure of intentions to return to their homeland at some point after immigration should be examined in future work. This variable may prove to be strongly associated with the connectedness variable already present in the model.

 This study proposes a multifocal model of integration to theorise immigrants’ integration in a transnational context 
 The model explicitly accounts for the three key foci of integration – co-ethnic community, host society and the transnational sphere – and enables us to conceptualise and empirically examine the complexity of integration in an encompassing and systematic way 
 First, that there is a simple underlying pattern behind the multitude of concrete indicators; for each focus, integration was found to be either one- or two-dimensional 
 Integration into the host society and co-ethnic community were both one-dimensional, which implies that the different theoretical dimensions largely coincide","Recent sociological inquiries draw on theories of belonging in examining the dynamic, complex and multidimensional relationship between the self and society in the context of social change (May, 2011, 2013). 
 Besides creating new social networks (Waldinger, 1995; Wessendorf and Phillimore, 2019), migrants’ integration is about identification and creating a new sense of belonging (Krzyżanowski and Wodak, 2008). 
 May (2013: 3) defines belonging as ‘the process of creating a sense of identification with, or connection to, cultures, people, places and material objects’. 
 Belonging can be described as a feeling of ease in social situations or as feeling at home. 
 It resembles Bourdieu’s (1979) ideas of habitus and social fields, according to which a person’s habitus reflects a certain social field and a ‘feel for the game’ in this field. 
 People can feel a sense of belonging to several ‘fields’ simultaneously and, the concept of belonging acknowledges the possibility of hybrid identities and multiple solidarities (May, 2013)",NA,"Methods and Empirical:Strategy:The authors used multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) separately for each focus to identify the underlying structure of integration. 
 MCA resembles factor or principal components analysis and enables data reduction for categorical variables. 
 The authors ran MCA using Burt’s approach and extracted the standard normalised coordinates (Greenacre, 2007; Le Roux and Rouanet, 2010; StataPress, 2015). 
 In this way, the authors derived a limited set of final indicators of integration and could study their relationships using linear regression models. 
 Differing inclusion probabilities and nonresponse were managed by adjusted sampling weights. 
 Prevalence, correlation and regression analysis accounted for the adjusted sampling weights, stratification of the design and finite population correction. 
 The authors' data were observational and cross-sectional, which limits causal interpretations due to the possible omitted variable bias and reverse/reciprocal causality.","Appendix Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics for the rest of the data. 
 Good Finnish language skills rank high (1.55) on the HS indicator, while weak skills rank lower (−1.63). 
 Those who consider Finnish as their subjective nationality differ markedly from those who do not (1.34 vs −0.12), and so on. 
 The authors' set of indicators for HS has remarkable covariation, which means that integration into the host society is empirically one-dimensional, ranging from those with many strong ties to the host society to those who are marginalised from it in multiple ways","This study proposes a multifocal model of integration to theorise immigrants’ integration in a transnational context. 
 Integration into the host society and co-ethnic community were both one-dimensional, which implies that the different theoretical dimensions largely coincide. 
 This corresponds to Durkheim’s insight in Division of Labour (2007a [1893]), where he argues that having a position in the system of production translates to a feeling of being useful and a part of something beyond oneself. 
 In the familial-emotional type (‘strong’ transnational integration), having one’s parents and siblings living abroad deepens transnational integration in emotional and identificational terms, while in the other type (‘weak’), this emotional-identificational dimension was not prominent 
 Taken together, these findings remind them to keep in mind how identification and sense of belonging relate to the more objective, structural side of integration. 
 Their relationship is eventually contingent and merits careful empirical attention","The estimated prevalence of multifocal marginalisation in the study population was 8.3 per cent (95% CI: 7.0–9.8%)",NA,"702 data","2020"

 Organisations manage mobility and the increasing number of self‐initiated expatriates (SIEs, individuals who initiate their expatriation without the help of an organisation) 
 Both trends have brought important research topics to the fore. 
 Unlike assigned expatriates (AEs), whose organisations transfer them temporarily to a new country (Tharenou, 2015), ISMs self‐initiate international mobility that entails higher levels of risk and unpredictability and usually involves significant life transitions (Zikic, Bonache, & Cerdin, 2010). 
 Their intention to settle for an indefinite period of time distinguishes them from SIEs who usually repatriate within a decade (Cerdin & Selmer, 2014). 
 Compared with AEs and SIEs, ISMs are perceived as having lower levels of agency (Guo & Al Ariss, 2015; Hajro, Zilinskaite, & Stahl, 2017)","By highlighting cross‐level linkages, underlying mechanisms, and situational contingencies, the authors aim to bridge the micro–macro divide in the literature on ISMs.

 Because research on ISMs is still nascent, we elaborate on the extent to which knowledge generated in the fields of AEs and SIEs can be meaningfully applied to aid our understanding of ISMs. We identify areas of overlap and distinction and derive future research implications. We develop a unifying, multilevel framework that extends our understanding of the antecedents, coping and acculturation processes, and outcomes of ISMs. We propose new theoretical insights based on the findings emerging from our review and highlight underresearched topics within the literature on ISMs. 
 In the last section, we present our integrative multilevel framework as means of guiding future research and practice. 
 Our aim was not to provide a comprehensive review of these literatures. Instead, our goal was to identity the extent to which knowledge generated in the field of expatriation can be meaningfully applied to ISMs and used as starting point for future research in this domain. 
 Because the antecedent factors identified in this conceptual review work in concert rather than in isolation, future research should examine the most critical combinations of variables. The latter seems important because individual differences, such as power, status, and minority group membership, might interact with variables and processes at the organisational and societal levels. Negative societal attitudes towards foreigners might be less constraining for higher status individuals (e.g., expatriates from Western Europe) and more constraining for lower status individuals (e.g., migrants from developing nations), who are expected to assimilate into the mainstream culture. 
 We offer several directions for future research. We note that with regard to individual‐level antecedents, very little or no research has been done on how ISMs' personality traits, cross‐cultural competences, and family dynamics are associated with their acculturation modes, coping effectiveness, and integration success outcomes. Research is needed to identify spousal characteristics (e.g., personality and career orientation) and family‐related factors (e.g., age of children and family functioning) that affect ISMs' coping strategies and acculturation outcomes. Migrants relocate for many reasons and face many challenges. Some are forced by war, often after long periods of loss, demoralisation, and debilitating internment to leave their countries. Others choose to leave to better themselves. These and other variations must surely make a difference in how these individuals adapt to relocation (Cerdin et al, 2014; Shaffer et al, 2012). Given that an ISM's family or partner may be the sole source of social support during this critical time, it is essential to study family characteristics that support these individuals in sustaining a positive state of affect and in continuing with their integration efforts in light of the challenges they face.","136 articles","2019"

Moreover, and this remark applies to not only acculturation but also MPSOC, without a qualitative investigation capturing the meanings of membership, attachment, and investment in a situated perspective, it is hard to know how MPSOC really interacts to affect beliefs, orientations, and behaviors of individuals and groups. The sheer quantitative combination of PSOC levels—as of cultural maintenance/culture adoption levels—is at risk of generating an oversimplified representation of much more nuanced psychosocial processes.

 The first wave of immigrants typically settled in suburban communities, which had relatively low racial and ethnic diversity, and no ethnically bounded enclaves. We argue that these community characteristics were instantiated in family settings as follows: settlement in middle-class suburban communities was embodied at the family level as high human capital and resources; low racial/ethnic diversity of suburban neighborhoods meant that geographically bounded social settings were not ethnically diverse, the experience of being minorities was salient for the Indian immigrant families; lack of ethnically bounded enclaves meant that family social networks within the geographical neighborhood were established across racial and ethnic boundaries, representing potential for developing bridging social capital",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"4 studies","2010"

 Ultimately, this research problematizes linear representations of immigration and integration, and the outcomes newcomers are expected to achieve that are found within government documents. Better understanding integration processes requires moving beyond the assumptions characterizing successful integration in order to attend to its complexity. By exploring the experiences of migrants who negotiate occupation and identity within particular places, integration has been shown to relate not only to achieving explicit markers such as employment, but also to more implicit elements. Drawing on participants’ experiences and the theoretical concepts framing this research, integration is reframed as an ongoing learning and reflection process occurring through occupation. This process is embedded within a particular social structure, highlighting the complex negotiations that take place in relation to occupation, place and identity within multiple fields. Attention to the variety of occupations that migrants need and want to engage in, rather than solely those emphasized within dominant integration discourses, makes it clear that the process and outcomes of integration are more complex than commonly assumed. Integration occurs not solely into ‘society’ more generally, but into a variety of fields of practice, and thus the process of integration should be viewed as multidirectional and ongoing. To acknowledge the more tacit elements of integration, we argue that discussions of whether or not newcomers are successfully integrated must be expanded beyond a checklist approach (e.g. do they have a job, have they learned English). They must also address how and why particular markers of integration are emphasized, and consider the ways that various aspects of social systems and structures enable or restrict migrants’ occupational engagement.","This research was undertaken as part of the primary author’s doctoral degree and was subject to time and resource constraints.

 While citizenship and belonging are highly theorized concepts, few have examined how individuals define and experience these concepts on the ground. In this chapter, I have shown how undocumented young adults develop two coinciding definitions of belonging – legal permission to live in the U.S and incorporation or “fitting in.” These definitions lead them to experience simultaneous feelings of exclusion and belonging. Specifically, the legal status definition of belonging promotes feelings of exclusion by highlighting the limitations created by their immigration status while the incorporation definition of belonging provides an opportunity to assert belonging by highlighting the many ways in which they are participating in and fit into U.S society. While the substantive literature has noted these tensions between feelings of belonging and exclusion (Abrego 2008; Gonzales 2011), I demonstrate that these tensions are the product of simultaneous, rather than alternating, feelings that result from these multiple definitions and broad understanding of belonging. I examine these conflicting feelings of belonging further in the following chapters and demonstrate their significance and impact on incorporation patterns.","Undocumented immigration status compounds these limitations so that few undocumented students attend college, and even fewer complete college. For those who manage to gather the resources they need to attend college, their educational pathways are disrupted by their undocumented status which creates financial instability by limiting access to financial aid and stable, well-paid employment. Pathways Out of l Examining the experiences of the approximately three quarters of undocumented young adults who (a) did not complete high school, (b) graduated from high school but did not attend college, and (c) attended community college but did not complete a degree reveals that many of undocumented young adults’ pathways out of school are not due directly to their immigration status. Their educational experiences reveal four key factors in pushing or pulling them out of school: (1) disengaging classrooms that contribute to missing class credits and push out to continuation schools, (2) family formation, (3) financial concerns, and (4) information and feelings about college attendance and graduation. Many of these are common push and pull out factors for all low-income, Latina/o, first-generation students, not just those who are undocumented. Further, the first two factors – disengagement and family formation – are gendered in that undocumented young men are more susceptible to push out through disengagement and criminalization in continuation school while undocumented young women are pulled off their educational paths by pregnancy. I find that their resistance to these raced, classed, and gendered push and pull out factors is weakened due to the limitations associated with their undocumented status, especially in relation to financial concerns and information and feelings about college attendance. In other words, most undocumented young adults find that there is no point in resisting raced, classed, and gendered factors since their undocumented status is going to raise barriers to paying for and utilizing an educational degree. 
 Despite being able to overcome many of the structural limitations to college matriculation, these emotional barriers can push undocumented students out of school. 
 These financial limitations have two specific consequences for undocumented young adults’ educational pathways through college: limiting the schools they choose to attend and lengthening their time to degree. In fact, most pursue community college first in order to manage financial costs which often lengthens their college career. These disruptions lead them to develop negative feelings of frustration and exclusion about their educational pathways. 
 Despite these financial limitations and contrary to those who do not pursue higher education, undocumented college students tend to persist because they believe that they will be able to utilize their degree and find a job despite their undocumented immigration status. Most rely on the experiences of undocumented college graduates to feed these perceptions. For example, Edith Sandoval, a CSU graduate with a teaching credential, was able to find a job as a teacher at a private school because the director knew her college mentor. Despite being able to directly use her degree and teaching credential, she explains that she is not using it in the way she wishes: “I wanted to be a teacher because I wanted to give back to inner city kids. I always pictured myself working for LAUSD [Los Angeles Unified School District] cause they have really bad schools in some areas. ... Instead I’m in a private school ... [with] kids who are not at a disadvantage. ... They have enough support. I don’t feel needed there.” Edith is the only college graduate respondent who is employed in the profession she aspires to. Despite this, the limited employment opportunities associated with her undocumented status prevent her from working with her preferred student population. However, her experience also reveals the critical nature of social networks in securing skilled employment after graduation. Along this line, Omar Valenzuela, a CSU student, explains that he is committed to building his network while still in school. “ [I’m] just pretty much networking and getting a network set up, so when you graduate you know who to call and maybe get an internship with somebody and go from there.” While most current students believe that networks will help them find employers who will hire them despite their undocumented status, few college graduates have found this to be the case. In fact, the majority are employed in similar, if not the same jobs, that they had did during college. Despite this reality, most undocumented young adults who are enrolled in or graduated from college believe that building networks and making small compromises will allow them to obtain stable employment that pays better than the jobs held by undocumented young adults who do not have a college degree. Further, they tend to believe that immigration reform is imminent – perhaps because of their tendency to be involved in or at least knowledgeable about the immigrant youth movement – and that this will allow them to obtain professional employment in the future. 
 Because these instances do not occur very often and most can find way to negotiate these limitations, this group of undocumented young adults does not perceive their undocumented status as a barrier that is salient in their everyday life. However, approximately half of respondents currently enrolled in college or who held an associate or bachelor’s degree 
 Julio Medina, a college graduate, notes that undocumented status becomes particularly salient in college because it contributes to academic, social, and extracurricular decisions which encourage individuals to develop a strong awareness of their undocumented status and its limitations. 
 Have a sense of the limitations of undocumented status because of its pervasive presence in the Latina/o community; 81% of the undocumented immigrants in the U.S are Latina/o (Passel and Cohn 2009). 
 Pablo Ortiz and Eva Santiz are both undocumented young adults who are struggling to make a living because of the limitations created by their undocumented immigration status. They both work in labor-intensive jobs – Pablo as a solicitor and Eva at a fast food chain restaurant – but they have developed alternative approaches and understandings of the significance of their immigration status within the workplace. While Pablo adopts a common representation of undocumented immigrants as workers who are constantly taken advantage of and discriminated against, Eva says that she is willing to speak up for her rights and challenge individuals who try to take advantage of her and other undocumented workers. These contradictory feelings suggest that undocumented young adults are both tolerating and challenging the structural limitations associated with their undocumented immigration status in the labor market. However, we do not know from where these diverging feelings emerge. How do undocumented immigrants e Pablo learn their position in the labor market and how do individuals like Eva learn to challenge this position? 
 One of the most common limitations associated with undocumented immigration status is the constant risk of detention and deportation. Deportations are on the rise with President Barack Obama on track to deport over two million individuals by the middle of 2014, more than all deportations conducted before 1997 (Golash-Boza 2013). Although a significant number of individuals are deported, the threat of deportation, or their “deportability,” increases the marginalizing effects of deportation policies by promoting a constant state of hypervigilance and fear in everyday life (De Genova 2002; De Genova and Peutz 2010). Attempting to minimize the risk of deportation, many undocumented immigrants limit their physical movement and social visibility which can limit their economic, political, and social participation (Menjívar 2011; Menjívar and Abrego 2012; Sigona 2012; Yoshikawa 2012). Although the concept of deportability encompasses how the threat of workplace raids and the difficulties of driving to the workplace without a license could impact participation in the labor force, it does not capture other employment-related policies that teach undocumented immigrants about the limitations of their undocumented status. 
 A small number of participants (6 out of 85) can be classified as “elites” who are able to deploy their educational credentials to obtain stable, salaried employment. Positions include: office manager for a large company, design engineer at an architecture firm, teacher, family counselor, and organizers at local non-profits. As Edgar Gonzalez explains, he has been able to use his community college engineering training and credentials because he developed relevant social networks. Specifically, a classmate offered him a job he was leaving at a construction company; he was able to build on the networks and skills he built in this first job to launch himself into his current job. Similarly, others explain that relevant social networks, often to citizens who are embedded in these career areas, are critical for moving into elite jobs. 
 Perceived limited access to worker’s rights. While many undocumented young adults have not been directly excluded from the labor market because of these policies, the threat of exclusion – or their excludability – does lead to their incomplete 
 These limitations are also mediated by social factors, specifically educational status and gender. First, I demonstrate that most undocumented young adults receive strong messages about dating that force them to consider their future legalization prospects. Second, I explore the effects of educational status and find that participating in higher education institutions not only contributes to the development of immigration status-based dating preferences but also opens up opportunities to find partners who meet these preferences. Finally, I take a close look at actual dating experiences and reveal how gender intersects with undocumented status to limit the participation of undocumented young men who are unable to meet gendered provider expectations. Overall, I argue that undocumented immigration status severely limits the social incorporation of undocumented young adults, especially undocumented men, by limiting their ability to fully participate and feel comfortable in dating contexts. 
 These limitations affect men much more than women. Undocumented immigration status puts individuals in a precarious financial situation which limits men’s ability to participate in normative dating experiences and causes them to experience less social incorporation than undocumented women. Gendered Norms in Dating e Despite the fact that most women respondents exhibit a desire to be independent and selfsufficient, traditional gender norms predominate within the context of dating. Beto Bonilla speaks to these conflicting messages: 
 While men are quick to cite the limitations their immigration status poses while dating, most women respondents struggle to answer the question about how their immigration status affects their dating experiences. It was not until I asked them to think about if they pay or drive on dates that they spoke about gendered expectations. Patricia Santamaria is a representative example: “I know I'm a girl. I have no problem with a guy paying for everything. I would make him pay for everything.” Additionally, when asked if she thought her dating experiences would have been different if she were a man, Lili Moreno compares her experiences to her two undocumented brothers in their early 20s: I’m trying to put myself into my brothers’ shoes. ... I think their social norms in terms of guys being the providers, guys taking the girls out on [a] date, guys have taken the initiative to do a lot those things. And when a guy is undocumented, I feel it disempowered [them] from fulfilling those social norms. ... This is based on my brother’s experiences. But because they don’t have a car, they can’t drive girls around. And you see those social norms. So I think definitely, I think it shies them away from putting themselves out there. 
 On the other hand, these gendered dating norms are so strongly ingrained that most undocumented men strive to meet these expectations despite the limitations of their immigration status. Take the example of Gilbert Morales, a single, 29-year old man, 
 While undocumented immigration status clearly shapes dating experiences, I find that the implications of these limitations are different for undocumented men and women because of the way that gender intersects with the limitations created by undocumented immigration status. While gendered dating roles privilege undocumented men in their ability to choose dating activities, it inhibits their ability to meet gendered expectations in other aspects of their dating experiences and promotes their social exclusion. “Trust Me”: The Privileged Position of Undocumented Men when Choosing Dating s Undocumented immigration status directly limits these young adults dating experiences by restricting the types of activities that can be pursued on dates. In California, undocumented young adults are unable to obtain a state issued ID; most respondents use their Mexican consulate ID (marticula), Mexican passport, or school ID as identification. As a result, going to a place that required proof of age, including normalized dating destinations such as bars or clubs, can force individuals to reveal their immigration status before they are ready. For example, presenting a non-California ID can raise questions from their date or lead to them being refused entrance or service29. This identification hurdle, coupled with gendered expectations, causes undocumented men and women to experience and manage their immigration status differently – men do so in private prior to the date and women do so in public while on the date. This means that undocumented men have a slight advantage in this instance since gendered expectations allow them to choose activities that will minimize the limitations of their immigration status. 
 He feels that he overreacted because this was just another example of the limitations his immigration status presented to his daily life. 
 This enables undocumented men to navigate one of the limitations of their immigration status – their lack of a state-issued ID – in a private manner. Within the context of navigating dating activities, gender and gendered expectations prove advantageous for undocumented men. However, these benefits do not persist in other aspects of their dating experiences. “I Suck!”: The Gendered Disadvantages of Undocumented Men When Dating Despite the advantages of being able to preemptively navigate one of the limitations of their immigration status, undocumented men face far more disadvantages than women when dating. Specifically, the direct and indirect limitations of undocumented immigration status are at odds with the male provider role. As a result, undocumented men are forced to postpone dates, feel perceived as less desirable partners, are limited in their transportation opportunities, and develop emotional barriers to dating. While pre-date experiences – postponing dates and feeling less desirable – are triggered indirectly by the effects of their immigration status on their financial situation, driving negotiations are directly linked to the limitations of their undocumented status. These direct and indirect effects of their immigration status on individual dates contribute to the development of long-term emotional consequences – feeling guilty about dating or avoiding dating all together – as they participate in the dating market over time. Together, these experiences demonstrate that, within the context of dating, undocumented men face more limitations than undocumented women due to the ways in which gendered provider expectations intersect with the limitations of their immigration status. Postponing s Postponing or avoiding a date is one of the main ways in which immigration status indirectly affects dating experiences through financial limitations. Specifically, undocumented immigration status forces individuals to work in the underground economy or the service sector, both places that are unlikely to check for proper documentation. As a result, many respondents report working in minimum wage jobs where there is little opportunity for upward mobility or increased pay. As a result, most undocumented young adults have limited discretionary funds, especially if they are trying to pay for college expenses. As a result, class functions as a mediating variable and allows immigration status to indirectly affect men’s ability to afford dates. This forces some men to either avoid dating all together or postpone a date until they have a little more money. 
 This suggests that the limitations imposed by women’s undocumented status align with their gender roles and thus lead to significantly less conflict. In addition, no woman respondent mentions that she is expected to drive and only one – Christina Guzman – mentions that she, rather than her partner, drives on a regular basis. She explains that this arrangement is due to a combination of her partner’s undocumented status and her possession of a driver’s license.31 Despite the logic of their arrangement, it still led to some conflict as she reports that her partner felt insecure with having her drive and not meeting his expected gender role: 
 These limitations more salient for men within the context of dating. While men are advantaged in their ability to chose activities that will not lead to a rejection of their IDs, they are by far more disadvantaged on the dating market – postponing dates, feeling less desirable, negotiating driving limitations, and incurring emotional consequences. While male privilege may benefit them in other aspects of their lives, their experiences in dating contexts suggest that gender intersects with undocumented status in a way that makes undocumented men uniquely vulnerable to being excluded from this aspect of social life because they cannot meet popular expectations of men as courters and providers. 
 Immigration status alone does not produce these limitations, rather it intersects with educational status and gender to produce differential experiences. 
 I find that the dating experiences of undocumented young adults are shaped by a heightened awareness of the limitations of their immigration status. Influenced by the incorrect popular belief that undocumented individuals can easily legalize their status through marriage, undocumented young adults receive messages that force them to constantly navigate their immigration status and the immigration status of their partner. These messages not only intertwine dating with legalization opportunities, but they also contribute to the development of immigration status-based dating preferences. Specifically, individuals who spent a significant amount of time in higher education institutions experience higher levels of physical and social mobility which not only heightened awareness of their immigration status but increased their exposure to and preferences for citizen partners. Immigration status also contributes to the development of emotional barriers to dating as some respondents avoid repeating past negative and exclusionary experiences by not dating and seek to secure potential future inclusion but prematurely ending relationships with undocumented individuals. 
 They find that their undocumented status produces limited job opportunities and financial instability due to legal limitations to working, including lacking a valid social security number. Specifically, their undocumented immigration status forces them to limit their job prospects to minimum wage work because these are easier to secure without proper documentation and there is a low risk of being identified as undocumented. These navigation strategies effectively prevent their advancement into well-paying, stable careers. Cesar Paredes explains the connection between the two: “They go hand-in-hand because most people that have high-paying jobs are legalized. ... They don’t necessarily go hand-in-hand 100% of the time, but maybe 97% of the time they do.” Most of my respondents’ experiences resonate with Cesar’s assertion as they occupy low-wage jobs, regardless of their educational attainment. In addition, most of the respondents who do not have children but are in committed partnerships assert that this was due to a lack of financial stability. While these financial concerns are shared by documented, low-income adults who struggle to piece together financial resources (Edin and Lein 1997), undocumented young adults experience more precarious employment situations and are limited in their ability to search out new jobs or switch employers. This tightly intertwined nature of financial stability and immigration status demonstrates that undocumented status indirectly affects childbearing decisions through financial instability. 
 Seeking to avoid these limitations, Delia Trujillo elected to switch jobs, taking a job selling cookware door-to-door rather than work in a factory. She says, “In this job, if you sell, what you [used to] make all week you can make in two days. You don’t have to spend 40 hours making it, but it’s a risk. It’s not definite. I like it ... because I can take care of my kids. Because I can have time for them, their sports and everything.”35 While her job pays much less and she struggles to financially support her four children, she is able to accompany them to a variety of extracurricular activities in the afternoons. Comparing the experiences of Irene and Delia demonstrates that undocumented status can limit a mother’s ability to both make the money they need to support their children while also actively involving themselves in their educational and extracurricular activities. Making these hard decisions, they often feel that they are falling short. Gendered Parenting Expectations and Decisions to Apply for Immigration Status These gendered parenting expectations also contribute to each eligible parent’s decision to apply to legalize his or her status through a citizen partner. Contrary to popular belief, the 
 As with education and work, these limitations produce feelings of exclusion as they are not able to participate in the ways they desire and expect. 
 I find that most undocumented young adults find ways to negotiate these limitations so that they can participate to some extent. For example, they find jobs and work even though laws explicitly bar them from formal employment. Thus, when assessed based on current assimilation theory, the incorporation patterns of undocumented young adults remain unclear as they participate to an extent but not fully because of the structural limitations created by their immigration status.",NA,"You know the famous sign around San Diego- the mother and father and they’re pulling the little girl along 
 Nobody looks at that little girl and thinks, “What happens to her when she grows up?” Stephanie, an undocumented young adult who came to the U.S as a young child, poses this question in the documentary Lost and Found to highlight how undocumented immigration status comes to limit the opportunities of undocumented immigrant children as they enter young adulthood (Tran 2007) 
 Despite relatively high levels of participation, undocumented young adults are not fully incorporated in the labor market because they do not feel like they belong in the jobs that they occupy and have not been able to participate in the ways that they desire and expect 
 I explore these experiences22 and draw on them to show that undocumented immigration status limits the social incorporation of undocumented young adults, especially men 
 I have shown that undocumented immigration status limits the social incorporation of undocumented young adults by structuring their dating messages, access to and preferences for partners, and ability to fully participate and feel comfortable on dates 
 How do participation and feelings of belonging within these various institutional contexts come together to produce and shape the overall incorporation levels of undocumented young adults? I argue that undocumented immigration status, at some points mediated by educational status and gender, limits the participation of undocumented young adults and contributes to feelings of exclusion when they are unable to participate in the ways they desire and expect",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"40% arrived before the age of six and completed all of their schooling in the U.S, another 40% arrived between ages 6-10 to enter elementary school, and 20% arrived between ages 11-16 to start middle school or early high school in the U.S I only interviewed Latinas/os since this group makes up 77% of the undocumented population 
 Given that the majority (59%) of the undocumented population is Mexican-origin, I primarily interviewed Mexican-origin individuals with three undocumented respondents from Guatemala, one legalized respondent from El Salvador and one legalized respondent from Peru 
 In fact, more than two thirds of the respondents (23 out of 35) who use language to demonstrate their belonging have participated in higher education. Furthermore, those who already hold a bachelor’s degree, 17% of the whole sample, represent 34% of respondents who make language-based claims; these college graduates were overrepresented among both English and Spanish-based language claims-makers 
 28% of undocumented young adults who migrated to the U.S before the age of fourteen do not complete high school and another 28% do not attend college after graduating from high school (Passel and Cohn 2009) 
 Of the 44% who attend college, more than half will likely not obtain a degree as 42% of all Latina/o college students leave college with no degree within six years and 17% are still working on their degree after six years (Radford et al 2010) 
 Despite the fact that approximately 75% of undocumented youth will not pursue higher education or will not complete their higher educational degree, relatively little research examines the reasons behind this 
 Examining the experiences of the approximately 75% of undocumented young adults who did not complete high school, graduated from high school but did not attend college, and attended community college but did not complete a degree reveals four key factors that push or pull them out of school: (1) disengaging classrooms that contribute to missing credits and push out to continuation schools, (2) family formation, (3) financial concerns, and (4) information and feelings about college attendance and graduation 
 Marcela suggests that while her Latina/o friends are citizens, they at least have a sense of the limitations of undocumented status because of its pervasive presence in the Latina/o community; 81% of the undocumented immigrants in the U.S are Latina/o (Passel and Cohn 2009) 
 Cesar Paredes explains the connection between the two: “They go hand-in-hand because most people that have high-paying jobs are legalized. They don’t necessarily go hand-in-hand 100% of the time, but maybe 97% of the time they do.”","Future research would benefit from examining these intergenerational exchanges in order to understand how the 1.5 generations’ awareness of rights can be leveraged to decrease labor abuses of all undocumented immigrants. Higher Levels of Acculturation: English Language Ability and Passing as a Citizen. 
 Future research would benefit from comparing groups of undocumented workers across generation, length of time in the U.S, and English language ability to assess which factors are key in facilitating rights-claiming in the work place. Examining intergenerational exchanges could shed light on how the 1.5 generations’ characteristics can be leveraged to decrease labor abuses of undocumented immigrants across the board. 
 My findings suggest that dating is an important aspect of social incorporation that merits future study. Assimilation theory accounts for social incorporation in addition to more structural forms of incorporation including educational, economic, and political incorporation (Alba and Nee 2003; Kasinitz et al 2008; Portes and Rumbaut 2001; Telles and Ortiz 2008). Discussions of social incorporation focus mainly on social capital and the building of social networks, especially co-ethnic networks, to facilitate immigrant’s navigation of a new social context (Menjívar 2000; Portes and Shafer 2007; Zhou and Bankston III 1998). For 1.5 and second generation young adults, social incorporation has largely been assessed through social capital and its utility for educational achievement and advancement (Stanton-Salazar and Dornbusch 1995; Valenzuela 1999; Zhou and Kim 2006). Perhaps this is because it is assumed that immigrant youth have fairly little trouble navigating social contexts due to their significant amount of socialization within the U.S context. While the consequence of dating (i.e. marriage) has been assessed as a measure of social incorporation or assimilation (Alba and Nee 2003; Arias 2001; Feliciano et al 2011; Gordon 1964; Telles and Ortiz 2008), few have studied immigrant’s experiences navigating dating contexts (Kasinitz et al 2008). Examining dating experiences can be a fruitful means of assessing the lived experience of the social incorporation process, rather than observing the outcome of dating (i.e. marriage choices). 
 Future studies need to examine this secondary layer of indirect and intergenerational legal violence in order to assess the full scope of this legal violence and the exclusion it creates. 
 I suggest that future work on undocumented immigrants needs to address these indirect effects of immigration status. I demonstrate that gender plays an integral role in structuring the childbearing and childrearing roles of undocumented young adults. Without paying attention to the indirect effects of such social locations, we could come out believing that undocumented immigration status solely affects the experiences of parents through risks of detention and deportation. Conducting a comparison across gender reveals, that gender is affecting the lives of undocumented young adults, and that it serves as a platform for undocumented immigration status to shape their lives in additional ways. 
 All together, this suggests that seemingly innocuous narratives that are absorbed during the acculturation process can contribute to downward assimilation patterns. I reason that segmented assimilation theory, and future studies of immigrant incorporation, need to consider and account for the indirect effects of social locations as well as the various cultural narratives available in the host society, not just countercultural ones, in order to fully assess the upward, downward, or selective incorporation pathways of immigrants. 
 While I have shed light on how educational status and gender may operate in various institutional contexts, future work should continue to examine the mediating effects of these and other social locations.","92 undocumented young adults","2014"

 The integration of immigrant adolescents into a new host society is a major concern for them, their families, and society. This study identified significant factors contributing to the acculturation of immigrant adolescents and the resulting attainment of developmental tasks such as family functioning, school climate, peer mediation, self-expansion motivation, and coping behaviors to create social capital. The findings emphasize that peer mediation and self-expansion motivation should be implemented and activated to make immigrant adolescents create their own social capital through host peer relationships and ethnic communities. The findings of the analysis suggest that stakeholders, including parents, teachers, and professional counselors, need to understand that there are different developmental patterns among immigrant adolescents, in spite of a similar level of cultural adaptation. Social support and peer mediation for immigrant adolescents should be oriented toward helping them achieve their developmental tasks rather than simply reducing acculturative stress. This study is significant in that it provides a theoretical framework to understand the acculturative process of immigrant adolescents in the context of normal development. Future research should examine the conditions to intervene in the process of stress-related growth further.","Small number of studies that examined the predictors of immigrant adolescents’ coping typology have identified that parental support, gender, and personality influence adolescents’ coping styles (Cavanaugh, Supple, Stein, Helms, Plunkett, & Sands, 2015; Connor-Smith & Flachsbart, 2007; Roesch, Wee, & Vaughn, 2007). The data in the present study show another important factor: motivation. The motivation shown by immigrant adolescents to manage stress and adjust to a new life can be classified into self-regulation and self-expansion. This study found that immigrant adolescents’ self-regulation motive contributed toward their achieving their academic goals, but excessive self-regulation appeared to delay age-specific development by suppressing other valuable activities fostering their growth. The findings of this study suggest that the self-expansion motive deserves attention. Consistent with prior research that presents the positive effect of self-expansion motivation on quality of interactions, interpersonal closeness, and feelings of self-efficacy (DysSteenbergen, Wright, & Aron, 2016), the data in the current study also found that immigrant adolescents with self-expansion motives achieved age-specific developmental tasks related to peer relationships, connection to valued people, and self-efficacy. These findings suggest that priming a self-expansion motive can help immigrant adolescents perform not only acculturative tasks but also developmental tasks successfully. 5.4. Acculturation and age-specific development Although many prior studies of immigrant adolescents have focused on the issue of acculturation, the current study aimed to understand their acculturation experience in the context of development. According to the findings, immigrant adolescents’ experience of acculturative stress may result in successful achievement of age-specific developmental tasks, including peer relationships, identity, and self-efficacy. However, it depends on particular coping behaviors that are encouraged by peer mediation and a self-expansion motive. They can grow by creating social capital by actively seeking help, creating ethnic networks through participation in ethnic organizations, and creating host peer relationships through involvement in school activities. This study proposes that immigrant adolescents’ acculturation should be understood in the context of their normal development and that social support and coping behaviors related to attainment of age-specific development should be encouraged. 5.5. Limitations and future research There are some limitations that should be considered in interpreting the findings of this study. First, this study collected data from immigrant adolescents through churches. Church membership would influence the perception of acculturative stress and types of coping behaviors. Further research can explore the role of church membership in the process of acculturation and the acculturation process among immigrant adolescents without church membership more deeply. Second, the findings are based on the data collected from Korean immigrant adolescents. Academic pressure and focus on academics, which delay other developmental achievements, might be prominent among Korean immigrant adolescents.

 A More Expansive Analysis of Transnationalism:This paper has argued that transnationalism is a social process that is both transborder and simultaneously engages two nation-states. I have suggested that the literature on transnational migration has focused mainly on the transborder connections of immigrants to their home countries and has yet to systematically explore simultaneity either theoretically or ethnographically. In fact, what most researchers have referred to as ‘transnationalism’ should more aptly be called ‘transborderism’, since simultaneity is not directly interrogated in most cases. However, because transnational is not the same thing as transborder, the two concepts should not be conflated. If the transborder linkages of immigrants affect only the sending country and do not have a simultaneous impact on the receiving country, we are not really dealing with transnationalism, but simply long-distance or deterritorialised nationalism. Therefore, if we continue to label any social process that takes place across national borders as transnational regardless of its simultaneity, we risk losing what is truly distinctive about transnationalism and merely reducing it to a variant of nationalism. In this sense, simultaneity is what transnationalism is all about.",NA,NA,"The Importance of Simultaneity in Transnational Migration Theory:The development of transnational migration theory, like other new social science paradigms, has followed a predictable pattern 
 Because these transborder ‘social fields’ are embedded in two societies, they enable immigrants to simultaneously affect and influence both the sending and receiving countries. This is the simultaneity aspect of transnationalism. Because of their emphasis on simultaneous participation and dual engagement in two nation-states, Basch, Glick Schiller and Szanton Blanc’s (1994) seminal book, Nations Unbound, emphasised how Haitian and Filipino transmigrants who had settled in the United States and were becoming socially and politically incorporated into the host society were able to remain involved in their home country through their transborder political and social connections

 If a certain amount of upward social mobility in the receiving country is necessary for immigrants to acquire the resources to engage in transborder activities, those who are socio-economically marginalised in the host society may be unable to develop extensive transborder ties with the homeland.2 Likewise, if immigrants are cut off from the home country, their inability to draw on the resources available through their transborder networks may simultaneously make it difficult for them to invest in their incorporation in the host society.",NA,NA,"Simultaneous transnational affiliations with both home and host countries are certainly possible, they seem mainly limited to more-highly skilled and professional immigrants who experience greater social acceptance and less discrimination in the host society because of their higher socio-economic status and better language skills.4 Since identity is based on an individual’s sense of belonging to specific social groups, immigrants who are more socially integrated and have more positive experiences in the host country will identify with it to a greater extent while maintaining their transborder affiliations to their countries of origin. 
 If transnational identities are based on the social incorporation and engagement of immigrants in the sending and receiving countries and if increased socio-economic incorporation in the host society enables greater transborder ties to the homeland, transnational identification with both countries could be positively reinforcing. 
 If socio-economic status enhances the prospects of transnational simultaneity, it indicates that, as unskilled immigrants become more socially mobile over time, a greater number of them will become transnationally active in both the home and host societies. 
 The author has argued that the authors need to more explicitly theorise transnational simultaneity by exploring the relationship between immigrants’ transborder engagement in the country of origin and their social assimilation and incorporation in the host society.","Home- and host-society participation can counteract each other in a zero-sum relationship where immigrants’ transborder ties delay their assimilation to the receiving country or assimilation processes discourage transborder attachments to the homeland, leading to less simultaneity. 
 The analysis of immigrant assimilation and social incorporation is an important component of transnationalism theory.6 Instead of focusing on the study of the various cross-border activities of immigrants, transnational migration theory must become more cognisant of the relative assimilation and incorporation of immigrants in the host society, which affect their transborder engagements but, in turn, are affected by them.",NA,NA,NA,"2012"

 These studies provide evidence for the validity of the model along a behavioral dimension, and the results suggest that the behavioral acculturation scale is a useful, operational measure of the construct of acculturation as presented above. 
 A basic hypothesis of the theoretical model is that individual acculturation is a linear process that progresses as a function of the length of time the person has been exposed to the host culture4. 
 The model predicts that indi­ vidual differences in measured acculturation covary with the number of years of exposure to the host culture so that the longer an individual has been exposed to the language, customs, habits, norms, and values, of a cultural reference group, the higher that person's acculturation score will be. 
 It is possible to estimate directly the validity of the acculturation model by examining Hypothesis 1 regarding the relation­ ship between scores on the scales and the length of time an individual has been exposed to a cultural reference group. 
 In order to test Hypotheses 1, scores on the acculturation scales were correlated with the years in the United States for subjects in Sample 3. 
 Since Hypotheses 1 and 2 demonstrated that individual differences in measured acculturation are related to both years in U .S. and age, separate analyses were conducted to determine the equivalency of males and females along these dimensions.","These findings indicate that males acculturate along the behavioral dimension more rapidly than females, and further that this difference is independent of age and length of exposure to the host culture.

 The literature on the subject of privacy in its relation to personal development is fragmentary but highly promising for future research. The study of the introspective type of personality suggests that selfanalysis is the counterpart of the inhibition of immediate and impulsive self-expression in social relations. J\!Iiterials for an understanding of the relation of retirement and privacy to the aesthetic, moral, and creative life of the person may be found in the lives of hermits, inventors, and religious leaders; in the studies of seclusion, prayer, and meditation; and in research upon taboo, prestige, and attitudes of superiority and inferiority. 
 A mass of descriptive material for the further study of the primary contacts is available from many sources. Studies of primitive peoples indicate that early social organizations were based upon ties of kinship and primary group contacts. Village life in all ages and with all races exhibits absolute standards and stringent primary controls of behavior. The Blue L8.ws of Connecticut are little else than primary-group attitudes written into law. Common law, the traditional code of legal conduct sanctioned by the experience of primary groups, may be compared with statute law, which is an abstract prescription for social life in secondary societies. Should be included the consideration of programs and projects for community organization upon the basis of primary contacts, as for example, Ward's The Social Center.

 Stimulation at one point of the animal organism produces contraction at another.

This is specific response or behavior. 
 The application of our knowledge of rapport, esprit de corps, and morale to an explanation of personal conduct and group behavior is one of the most promising fields for future research. In the family, rapport and consensus represent the most complete co-ordination of its members. The life of the family should be studied intensively in order to -define more exactly the nature of the family consensus, the mechanism of family rapport, and minor accommodations made to minimize conflict and to avert tendencies to disintegration in the interest of this real unity. 
 Future research will provide a more adequate sociology of subordination and superordination. A survey of the present output of material upon the nature and the effects of personal contacts reinforces the need for such a fundamental study. The obsolete writings upon personal magnetism have been replaced by the so-called ""psychology of salesmanship,"" ""scientific methods of character reading,"" and '' the psychology of leadership."" The wide sale of these books indicates the popular interest, quite as much as the lack of any fundamental understanding of the technique of human re;ations. 
 The popular conception is that labor unrest is due to the dull driving routine of machine industry. The matter needs further study.

Journal of Refugee Studies, 21(1), 1–18. https://doi.org/10.1093/jrs/fem047","Ryan2008","The model outlined here emphasizes four key issues. First, resources are central to the migrant adaptation process. The nature and level of these resources must be understood in the context of the individual’s needs and goals, as well as the demands he or she encounters. Second, an analysis of the psychological adaptation of refugees must take into account experiences from the pre-migration, flight and post-migration temporal phases. Third, resources are in a constant state of flux. The pre-migration and flight phases will primarily be characterized by resource loss, especially in terms of personal, material and social resources. The mere act of entering a new sociocultural environment means that the migrant will almost inevitably experience the loss or devaluing of some cultural resources, such as social status, education, occupational skills and experience. Fourth, the authorities of the host society may place constraints on access to key resources (e.g. employment, education, a secure legal status). 
At the heart of it lies the concept of resources. However, resources must be understood in terms of the individual’s needs, personal goals and the demands he or she encounters. Each of these concepts must be examined in the context of the pre-migration, flight and post-migration phases. The additional concept of constraints on the use of or access to resources is particularly relevant to the post-migration phase. Personal resources can be physical or psychological in nature. Health, mobility, energy and physical attractiveness are physical resources. Psychological resources include both skills and personal traits. Examples of skills-based resources are problem-solving and social skills. Trait-based resources include self-esteem, optimism, self-efficacy and hope. Material resources include money, property, means of transport and personal possessions in general. Paid employment can also be seen as a material resource. Social resources refer to the beneficial aspects of personal relationships. These include emotional, informational and tangible support, as well as the sense of identity and belonging that integration in a social network brings. cultural resources to describe skills, knowledge and beliefs that are learned within a particular cultural setting, and whose adaptive value is often intimately related to their being deployed in such a setting or in similar ones.

 The model outlined here aims to sensitize researchers to the wide range of variables that need to be taken into consideration when examining the psychological well-being of refugees. This is not to suggest that there are no researchers out there who are sensitive to the complexity of refugee wellbeing. Silove and his co-workers, for example, have conducted a number of excellent studies which examine the interplay of pre- and post-migration factors in relation to the well-being of asylum seekers (e.g. Silove et al 1997). In a sense, what we have aimed to provide here is an explicit statement of the theoretical assumptions that underpin such work.:The two dominant models applied to the study of psychological well-being among refugees—the medical model and the psychosocial stress model—have inspired a great deal of quantitative research on refugees. However, the actual human stories and voices of the refugees themselves are curiously absent in much of literature in psychiatry and psychology, though there are noteworthy exceptions (e.g. Miller et al 2002). The broader range of conceptual tools outlined here (resources, needs, goals, demands and constraints) provides a basis for researchers to go beyond the one-dimensional views of refugees that are often portrayed in the literature—as bearers of symptoms, coping styles etc.—and to give them a voice. In addition to giving refugees a voice, researchers should strive to identify effective methods for arresting resource loss and promoting resource gain among this population. We need to look at the deficiencies within ourselves as host societies—within our attitudes and policies—and at the types of changes that we need to make to allow the resourcefulness of refugees to flourish.","To achieve a more holistic view of the life experiences of refugees, we need to look at the limitations of our current theoretical models. This article critically examines some of the major theoretical approaches that have guided research on the psychological well-being of refugees: the medical model, the psychosocial stress model and Berry’s (1997) ‘acculturation framework’. It goes on to examine Hobfoll’s (2001) Conservation of Resources stress theory, a model which has important implications for refugee research. Drawing upon the models reviewed, the last section outlines a conceptual framework for adaptation among refugees. At the heart of it lies the concept of resources. However, resources must be understood in terms of the individual’s needs, personal goals and the demands he or she encounters. Each of these concepts must be examined in the context of the pre-migration, flight and post-migration phases. The additional concept of constraints on the use of or access to resources is particularly relevant to the post-migration phase.

Others from similar backgrounds, or with lower levels of human capital but ensconced in strong co-ethnic communities, undergo selective acculturation, where the learning of English and American ways takes place simultaneously with the preservation of key elements of the parental culture. youths from working-class migrant families who lack strong community support may experience dissonant acculturation, where introjection of the values and language of the host society is accompanied by rejection of those brought by and associated with their parents. + External Obstacles: The barriers that confront the children of immigrants can be summarised as racism, bifurcated labour markets, and the existence of alternative deviant lifestyles grounded in gangs and the drug trade.","Theory","General",NA,NA,1,1,NA,NA,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"dynamic","theoretical",NA,"journal-article","The Adaptation of the Immigrant Second Generation in America: A Theoretical Overview and Recent Evidence","Alejandro Portes, Patricia Fernández-Kelly, William Haller","Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies",2009,"10.1080/13691830903006127",NA,NA,NA,"The analysis finds that Mexican-Americans are doubly handicapped, both by their lower educational achievement and by the much higher returns to education at the present time 
 Soon, one in four young Americans will be an immigrant or the child of an immigrant.

Following the lead of classic assimilation theory, some scholars have advanced a highly optimistic prognosis about the future of this population: the children of immigrants will assimilate into English and American ways, advance educationally and occupationally, and take their rightful place in society’s mainstream (Alba and Nee 2003).:There are valid grounds for this prognosis since the majority of this population is managing to do well in school and avoid the pitfalls that can derail their progress. However, this optimistic outlook neglects two facts: first, a sizeable minority is not managing to overcome these challenges; second, those who do not overcome them come disproportionately from certain immigrant groups and not others.

 The process had become segmented into several distinct paths, some leading upwards but others downward

 Exogenous factors can be conceptualised as the principal resources that immigrant families bring to the confrontation with the external challenges facing their children 
 These factors are: 1) the human capital that immigrant parents possess; 2) the social context that receives them in America; and 3) the composition of the immigrant family.",NA,NA,NA,"One in four young Americans will be an immigrant or the child of an immigrant. This surging population cannot but have a deep effect on the entire society and, especially, on the cities and regions where it concentrates. 
 This article presents a synthesis of more recent findings, showing how the process plays itself over time and what effects school context, academic outcomes and selective acculturation have on it 
 These effects are of two types: first, those that mediate or reinforce the three exogenous determinants in Figure 1; second, countervailing factors in the process of acculturation, leading to upward mobility. 
 The results point to the resilient effects of certain national origins, used as a proxy for a negative mode of incorporation 
 These effects are impervious to mediation by school characteristics or academic outcomes and impinge directly on the likelihood of downward assimilation. 
 The second set of effects draws on the intervening variables identified in Figure 2 to show how factors associated with selective acculturation may countermand the power of exogenous determinants and lead, in exceptional cases, to educational and occupational success from backgrounds of severe disadvantage. 
 Making assimilation less ‘segmented’ emerges from this analysis as a public good to be sought, for the sake of immigrant children, but of the entire society","The nine national groups identified are representative of over 80 per cent of the contemporary immigrant population of the United States 
 The rate then rises to about 10 per cent of the Vietnamese; over 15 per cent of Colombians, public-school Cubans and Filipinos; 25 per cent among Haitians, West Indians, Laotians and Cambodians; and a remarkable 41 per cent among Mexican-Americans 
 The influence of educational ambition, although weaker, runs in the same direction, with college and post-college aspirations reducing DAI scores by 9 per cent 
 Stable families still reduce the likelihood of downward assimilation by a net 25 per cent and each standard deviation in the family SES index leads to an additional 10 per cent reduction 
 Average school SES continues to have its expected significant effect, with each additional SES point reducing DAI scores by 0.4 per cent 
 Less expected is the effect of school ethnic composition. This coefficient is now highly significant, but its direction is the opposite of that expected: junior-high schools with 60 per cent or more of minority students (coded higher) reduce downward assimilation, controlling for other variables 
 After controlling for all early school variables, Mexican-American youths continue to have a 26 per cent chance of greater downward assimilation and the two predominantly black minorities in the sample*Haitians and Jamaican/West Indians*about a 40 per cent greater chance relative to the rest of the sample 
 Previous studies based on CILS and other data have shown that fluent bilingualism is significantly associated with positive outcomes in late adolescence, including higher school grades, educational aspirations and self-esteem, and lesser intergenerational conflict (Hakuta 1986; Peal and Lambert 1962; Portes and Hao 2002; Rumbaut 1994) 
 While over 40 per cent of the Mexican-American youths in the sample were burdened by premature childbearing and 20 per cent of the MexicanAmerican, Central American and West Indian young males had already been incarcerated for a crime, just 50 cases or less than 1 per cent of the original sample managed to overcome the consequences of a heavily disadvantaged upbringing",NA,"3564 cases","2009"

 Among the findings from this study were the following: (1) in the overall sample, nearly one-third of the immigrant women reported at least one first-hand encounter with racism since immigrating to their host country; (2) the majority of these encounters occurred in workplace settings; and (3) in participants’ descriptions of the effects of racism on their emotional well-being, the most commonly reported effects included self-directed blame and a loss of a sense of one’s self-worth 
 The findings from these studies raised several questions, including the following: How might immigration and adaptation to Canada or the United States influence self-silencing among women from the Caribbean? What is the relationship between self-silencing and systemic racism in the experiences of Caribbean immigrant women in Canada and the United States? And, more broadly, what can the interplay between self-silencing, racism, and emotional distress tell us about the immigrant experience? All of these questions are embedded in an assumption that aspects of a host culture create a social experience for immigrant women in which emotional well-being can be compromised through prolonged acculturative stress

 A More Expansive Analysis of Transnationalism:This paper has argued that transnationalism is a social process that is both transborder and simultaneously engages two nation-states. I have suggested that the literature on transnational migration has focused mainly on the transborder connections of immigrants to their home countries and has yet to systematically explore simultaneity either theoretically or ethnographically. In fact, what most researchers have referred to as ‘transnationalism’ should more aptly be called ‘transborderism’, since simultaneity is not directly interrogated in most cases. However, because transnational is not the same thing as transborder, the two concepts should not be conflated. If the transborder linkages of immigrants affect only the sending country and do not have a simultaneous impact on the receiving country, we are not really dealing with transnationalism, but simply long-distance or deterritorialised nationalism. Therefore, if we continue to label any social process that takes place across national borders as transnational regardless of its simultaneity, we risk losing what is truly distinctive about transnationalism and merely reducing it to a variant of nationalism. In this sense, simultaneity is what transnationalism is all about.",NA,NA,"The Importance of Simultaneity in Transnational Migration Theory:The development of transnational migration theory, like other new social science paradigms, has followed a predictable pattern 
 Because these transborder ‘social fields’ are embedded in two societies, they enable immigrants to simultaneously affect and influence both the sending and receiving countries. This is the simultaneity aspect of transnationalism. Because of their emphasis on simultaneous participation and dual engagement in two nation-states, Basch, Glick Schiller and Szanton Blanc’s (1994) seminal book, Nations Unbound, emphasised how Haitian and Filipino transmigrants who had settled in the United States and were becoming socially and politically incorporated into the host society were able to remain involved in their home country through their transborder political and social connections

 If a certain amount of upward social mobility in the receiving country is necessary for immigrants to acquire the resources to engage in transborder activities, those who are socio-economically marginalised in the host society may be unable to develop extensive transborder ties with the homeland.2 Likewise, if immigrants are cut off from the home country, their inability to draw on the resources available through their transborder networks may simultaneously make it difficult for them to invest in their incorporation in the host society.",NA,NA,"Simultaneous transnational affiliations with both home and host countries are certainly possible, they seem mainly limited to more-highly skilled and professional immigrants who experience greater social acceptance and less discrimination in the host society because of their higher socio-economic status and better language skills.4 Since identity is based on an individual’s sense of belonging to specific social groups, immigrants who are more socially integrated and have more positive experiences in the host country will identify with it to a greater extent while maintaining their transborder affiliations to their countries of origin. 
 If transnational identities are based on the social incorporation and engagement of immigrants in the sending and receiving countries and if increased socio-economic incorporation in the host society enables greater transborder ties to the homeland, transnational identification with both countries could be positively reinforcing. 
 If socio-economic status enhances the prospects of transnational simultaneity, it indicates that, as unskilled immigrants become more socially mobile over time, a greater number of them will become transnationally active in both the home and host societies. 
 The author has argued that the authors need to more explicitly theorise transnational simultaneity by exploring the relationship between immigrants’ transborder engagement in the country of origin and their social assimilation and incorporation in the host society.","Home- and host-society participation can counteract each other in a zero-sum relationship where immigrants’ transborder ties delay their assimilation to the receiving country or assimilation processes discourage transborder attachments to the homeland, leading to less simultaneity. 
 The analysis of immigrant assimilation and social incorporation is an important component of transnationalism theory.6 Instead of focusing on the study of the various cross-border activities of immigrants, transnational migration theory must become more cognisant of the relative assimilation and incorporation of immigrants in the host society, which affect their transborder engagements but, in turn, are affected by them.",NA,NA,NA,"2012"

 During all phases of the intercultural migration process, newcomers must continuously reorganize the delicate structure of their various subidentities—those related to their membership in the new host society and those involving their attachment to the values of their former culture (Horenczyk, 1996). 
 Posing the two issues simultaneously generates a framework that defines four types of acculturation attitudes: integration, assimilation, separation, and marginalization. 
 Two modes of acculturation indicate the adoption of monocultural identities: Assimilation refers to the relinquishing of one’s minority identity and the attempt to adopt the new one, whereas separation refers to the rejection of the new dominant culture and the maintaining of one’s minority identity. 
 The bicultural option (LaFromboise, Coleman, & Gerton, 1993), termed integration by Berry (1990), is characterized by the immigrant’s adoption of aspects from the new society and culture without rejecting their former or minority identity. 
 Marginalization occurs when immigrants reject both their former or minority identity and that of the dominant host society",NA,"PARTICIPANTS:The participants in the study were 526 young soldiers, serving their compulsory military service in the Israeli Defense Forces, who immigrated to Israel from the former Soviet Union during the years 1989-1999.

 The authors' findings provided support for the validity of Horenczyk’s (1996) elaboration of the bidimensional model: As predicted by the theory conceptualized in the mapping sentence, the perspective facet performed a modulating function in the SSA configuration. 
 The two kinds of partitions, polarizing and modulating, resulted in the radex spatial structure predicted by the mapping sentence, contributing to the validation of the theory","Given the low proportion of immigrant respondents who preferred to complete the Hebrew questionnaire (less than 20%), this finding could suggest that this choice reflects an assimilationist orientation","Future research can make use of the mapping sentence for the development and refinement of the acculturation orientations model. Facet theory proposes two ways in which this can be done. The extension method involves the addition of one or more elements to an existing facet. Our model of acculturation orientations can be “extended” by including additional perspectives within the mapping sentence. Higgins’s (1987) conceptualization of the self, on which his “self-discrepancies theory” is based, can provide additional elements and broaden our view of the immigrant’s self following cultural transition. Our self/ own and perceived expected perspectives roughly correspond to the actual and expected domains of the self; one extension of this facet could add Higgins’s Future Self perspective (“what acculturation orientation do I foresee for myself”). Following such an extension, the perspectives facet would include three elements, allowing the examination of internal order between the various elements of the modulating facet. The second method for theory development is that of intension, namely, the addition of facets to the mapping sentence. We could broaden our understanding of acculturation orientations among immigrants by examining their differential patterns in diverse intra- and intercultural settings. When dealing with immigrants in the army, a new facet representing “setting” could include elements such as home, army, and leisure time outside the army. The addition of facets to the mapping sentence can lead to predictions of three-dimensional spatial structures.","195 respondents","2003"

 Minorities, and relatedly, the issue of cultural transmission in minorities living in a foreign cultural majority environment, have become focal topics in several branches of social science, including sociology, psychology, and educational science 
 The theory of cultural transmission in minorities proposed in this article is tailored to the social phenomenon in question 
 We argue, the theory is able to explain several findings that pose difficulties to existing theories, in particular the frequently observed stability of cultural traits in ethnic minorities (e.g. Bisin and Verdier, 2011; Mchitarjan and Reisenzein, 2013a) 
 The theory suggests refined answers to scientific as well as political questions surrounding minority–majority relations, such as: What are the reasons for, and the conditions that aid or hinder, cultural transmission in minorities in a foreign cultural environment? Which factors determine the educational policies of a majority society towards a particular minority? Under what conditions can the integration of minorities succeed, and when will it fail?

 The main thesis posited in this work is that immigrants’ political experiences concerning their countries of origin will influence post-migration political attitudes, predispositions and behaviors once these individuals cross nations’ borders. This thesis encompasses multiple facets of political life. The first one of those facets has been examined in this chapter, namely political attitudes. I examined whether levels of trust in the country of origin’s government influences an individual’s broader views of the political sphere, including trust in the U.S government. Also, I tested whether prior political experiences, defined in contextual terms, have an impact on levels of trust in the U.S government. In this chapter, I showed that trust in one’s country of origin’s government increases the prospects of becoming more trusting of the American government following migration. Acknowledging the limitations of the cross-sectional nature of the data, the analyses presented hints to the possibility that the “imported trust” effect might not wane with the passage of time. Results also provided support for this chapter’s contention that trust in the U.S government is at least partially explained by the level of democracy encountered during the socialization process in one’s country of origin. Immigrants who were socialized under highly democratic regimes exhibit less trust in government once they arrive in the United States. Bearing in mind these initial findings regarding political attitudes, let me focus now on another matter: whether an immigrant’s political predispositions in the country of origin influence the prospects that the individual will be politically engaged once in the United States.","Another main advantage of this type of study is that, due to the experimental nature of this method, small number of participants can still provide for reliable and systematic evidence.",NA,"People’s experiences throughout their lives influence their later thoughts and actions, including thoughts and actions about politics 
 The core thesis advanced in this dissertation is that immigrants’ political connections and attitudes with regard to their countries of origin will influence postmigration political predispositions and behaviors once these individuals have settled in the United States 
 When immigrants are treated as political blank slates, we completely overlook these important components of political behavior 
 This study has focused on the intensity and directionality of engagement by looking at the effect of both “contextual” and “individual” forces that shape the size and content of immigrants’ political suitcases 
 These individuals come to the United States with political suitcases, which are important, if not fundamental, components of their political behavior 
 The core thesis advanced in this dissertation is that immigrants’ political suitcases will influence post-migration political predispositions and behaviors once these individuals have crossed nations’ borders",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"In Table 3.1, we see that nearly 50 percent of Mexican non-partisans either had no preference in the U.S election or were indifferent between the Democrats and Republicans, whereas the comparable mark among Mexican partisans is just over 40 percent","These individuals come to the United States with political suitcases, which are important, if not fundamental, components of their political behavior. Further research is still required to determine the specific weight of such suitcases on particular political activities and whether this study’s findings can be extended to immigrants from other regions of the world. After three empirical chapters, several dependent variables and two very different ways to approach the imported socialization phenomenon, I feel comfortable to say that this theory was laid out to generate “as many observable implications as possible,” which allowed to “put the theory at risk of being falsified more times” (King et al 1994: 19). Building on all of these findings, let me turn our attention to some final considerations both in terms of the research steps to follow and certain policy consequences that may be derived from this study’s findings. 
 Because I view it as important that future research parse out the effects of various factors that contribute to immigrants’ political orientations, follow-up work that accounts for enduring influences is to be encouraged. I would be interested in incorporating the “Big Five”39 framework (as suggested by Mondak 2010) into my analyses of immigrants’ political behavior. The idea of this incorporation is two-fold. As posited earlier, the incorporation of such framework should allow me to disentangle the effects of personality trait factors from socialization-driven forces on individuals’ attitudes and behaviors after migration. But not less importantly, this framework should allow me to approach situational variance from a new angle. It might be the case that the imported socialization process operates differently on individuals due to their personality traits rather than due to their education/sophistication levels. In the following paragraphs, I elaborate a bit further on this point. 
 The results offered in Chapter Three regarding the effects of pre-migration partisan attachments and ideological predispositions on the directionality of political engagement following migration call for further research. Recall that my findings suggest that, though to varying degrees, all of the three main partisan identifications in Mexico provide an important baseline to become engaged with either of the two main political parties in the United States. This result is present among Mexicans in the before migration portion of my analyses in that chapter. These two sets of results imply that translation of partisan attachments from one’s country of origin to the new host country are rather complex, new studies are in order to better capture the underpinnings of such a translation process. The same can be said regarding the translation of ideological predispositions from the old political world to the new political world. The possibility of two interrelated follow-up studies comes to mind.","3 hypothetical immigrants","2009"

 A More Expansive Analysis of Transnationalism:This paper has argued that transnationalism is a social process that is both transborder and simultaneously engages two nation-states. I have suggested that the literature on transnational migration has focused mainly on the transborder connections of immigrants to their home countries and has yet to systematically explore simultaneity either theoretically or ethnographically. In fact, what most researchers have referred to as ‘transnationalism’ should more aptly be called ‘transborderism’, since simultaneity is not directly interrogated in most cases. However, because transnational is not the same thing as transborder, the two concepts should not be conflated. If the transborder linkages of immigrants affect only the sending country and do not have a simultaneous impact on the receiving country, we are not really dealing with transnationalism, but simply long-distance or deterritorialised nationalism. Therefore, if we continue to label any social process that takes place across national borders as transnational regardless of its simultaneity, we risk losing what is truly distinctive about transnationalism and merely reducing it to a variant of nationalism. In this sense, simultaneity is what transnationalism is all about.",NA,NA,"The Importance of Simultaneity in Transnational Migration Theory:The development of transnational migration theory, like other new social science paradigms, has followed a predictable pattern 
 Because these transborder ‘social fields’ are embedded in two societies, they enable immigrants to simultaneously affect and influence both the sending and receiving countries. This is the simultaneity aspect of transnationalism. Because of their emphasis on simultaneous participation and dual engagement in two nation-states, Basch, Glick Schiller and Szanton Blanc’s (1994) seminal book, Nations Unbound, emphasised how Haitian and Filipino transmigrants who had settled in the United States and were becoming socially and politically incorporated into the host society were able to remain involved in their home country through their transborder political and social connections 
 This paper argues that transnationalism research needs to go beyond transborder linkages and more extensively theorise the significance of simultaneity

 If a certain amount of upward social mobility in the receiving country is necessary for immigrants to acquire the resources to engage in transborder activities, those who are socio-economically marginalised in the host society may be unable to develop extensive transborder ties with the homeland.2 Likewise, if immigrants are cut off from the home country, their inability to draw on the resources available through their transborder networks may simultaneously make it difficult for them to invest in their incorporation in the host society.",NA,NA,"Simultaneous transnational affiliations with both home and host countries are certainly possible, they seem mainly limited to more-highly skilled and professional immigrants who experience greater social acceptance and less discrimination in the host society because of their higher socio-economic status and better language skills.4 Since identity is based on an individual’s sense of belonging to specific social groups, immigrants who are more socially integrated and have more positive experiences in the host country will identify with it to a greater extent while maintaining their transborder affiliations to their countries of origin. 
 If transnational identities are based on the social incorporation and engagement of immigrants in the sending and receiving countries and if increased socio-economic incorporation in the host society enables greater transborder ties to the homeland, transnational identification with both countries could be positively reinforcing. 
 If socio-economic status enhances the prospects of transnational simultaneity, it indicates that, as unskilled immigrants become more socially mobile over time, a greater number of them will become transnationally active in both the home and host societies. 
 The author has argued that the authors need to more explicitly theorise transnational simultaneity by exploring the relationship between immigrants’ transborder engagement in the country of origin and their social assimilation and incorporation in the host society.","Home- and host-society participation can counteract each other in a zero-sum relationship where immigrants’ transborder ties delay their assimilation to the receiving country or assimilation processes discourage transborder attachments to the homeland, leading to less simultaneity. 
 The analysis of immigrant assimilation and social incorporation is an important component of transnationalism theory.6 Instead of focusing on the study of the various cross-border activities of immigrants, transnational migration theory must become more cognisant of the relative assimilation and incorporation of immigrants in the host society, which affect their transborder engagements but, in turn, are affected by them.",NA,NA,NA,"2012"

Rational choice theory fails because it views the people as atomistic agents, be they individual potential migrants, groups, households, organizations, and nation-states. In order to bridge analytical levels, ties and linkages between the positions these agents take within these broader structures could then only be introduced in an ad hoc manner.

 In the case of international migration, new webs of ties and corresponding capital often crystallize in migrant networks

Per the original framework introduced 40 years ago, the more vitality an ethnolinguistic group perceives itself to have, the more likely that it will thrive as a collective entity in an intergroup context. Consequently, research adopting this paradigm—herein termed vitality theory—has studied ways in which objective and subjective group vitality has manifested itself in the endurance of ethnolinguistic groups. The notion of objective vitality includes the factors of demographics, institutional support, and status that characterize the strength of a group in comparison to others present in an intergroup setting. Contrastively, subjective vitality was introduced to highlight how groups may cognitively and affectively perceive these same factors.

A large body of empirical research has been conducted within the vitality theory framework that has resulted in several stages of development. Evidence has shown that while the components of objective vitality (demographics, institutional support, status) do not typically manifest themselves as distinct components in the structure of subjective vitality, they do form a single component reflecting the perceived strength of the group. In addition, several other social psychological factors, such as perception of the legitimacy of intergroup relations, the level of ethnocentrism, and perception of intergroup distance, were incorporated into models of subjective vitality. Relatedly, these factors are shaped into group members’ discourse of vitality, which is a highly dialogical process of negotiation of subjective vitality of the groups engaged in intergroup contact.

The vitality framework has been usefully invoked beyond ethnolinguistic groups, embracing several intergroup settings including age, gender, and sexual orientation. Vitality, which has provoked some controversy in the literature, has also been widely adopted by very different approaches as an umbrella term to denote the long-term sustainability of a group. Scholars in linguistics, sociology, psychology, education, anthropology, and beyond have contributed much to the concept, helping to educate and raise awareness as to why languages die out and the effects of such languages dying out.","Theory","Aspect","Language",1,NA,1,NA,1,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"static","theoretical","also lit on how this is predicted by motivational and predicts behavioral","book-chapter","Towards a Theory of Language in Ethnic Group Relations","Howard Giles, Richard Y.

 Institutional settings and policies vary greatly across industrialized countries, so comparative analysis can seek to identify which settings and policies are most efective in promoting the well-being of immigrant youth. Recent studies and monitoring procedures in relation to well-being, social inclusion/exclusion, and child well-being provide a framework within which this can be set, distinguishing key dimensions. his chapter has sought to place:Nolan some key indings from the disparate social science research literature on immigration and youth within that framework, dealing in turn with the domains of education, employment and earnings, economic resources and poverty, housing, and family and peer relationships.:To assess which institutional settings and policies are most efective, one needs to look at how similar immigrants fare in diferent countries, but that is very demanding in terms of information, in relation to institutions and policies, to outcomes, and most important to the migrants themselves and their backgrounds – treating immigrants as a homogenous group is highly misleading. Furthermore, whether migrant youth are doing better in terms of key outcomes in one country versus another in absolute terms is distinct from the “migrant penalty,” which compares their outcomes with others in the country in question.:In discussing educational outcomes, traditional explanations emphasizing social background were seen to work rather well in explaining ethnic minority disadvantage; targeted programs aimed at migrants did not appear to be responsible for much of the diference in outcomes for migrant youth across countries, with the way the education system is structured in the irst place being much more important. hough the comparative research available to support it is less well developed, this broad conclusion may hold across other domains as well. Structures that are unfavorable for the disadvantaged are also likely to handicap many immigrants, and strategies to improve the situation of those with limited educational and skills – for example directing resources toward schools in deprived neighborhoods or toward retraining and reintegration of the unemployed – will also beneit without targeting them explicitly. First generation migrants (and the “1.5” generation) may still face particular obstacles across the various domains, due for example to limited entitlements to social protection and to language and other socioeconomic and cultural barriers to integration. his provides a clear rationale for targeted support in language acquisition and schooling, for health and social services directed toward the special needs of migrants and aimed at promoting and facilitating appropriate utilization patterns, and for housing policies that prioritize access of recent migrants to rental or social housing. Antidiscrimination policies may be at least as important. Many countries have implemented stringent antidiscrimination legislation and education programs aimed at changing attitudes, and vigorous implementation on both fronts seems essential if outcomes for migrants from particular minority groups are to be improved. he conditions under which airmative action does more good than harm for such groups need careful study.",NA,NA,"Introduction he well-being of immigrant youth – of the irst or second generation – is intimately tied to their socioeconomic status and success, and these are important for social cohesion in society 
 Capturing Well-being To assess the well-being of immigrant youth, one needs a clear conceptual perspective. here is a substantial body of research focused on monitoring well-being, including across countries, from which much can be learned about the key dimensions of well-being and how they are measured for the general population and for children and young people. his can provide a general framework within which to set assessment of the situation of immigrant youth, supplemented by speciic features of particular relevance for them
