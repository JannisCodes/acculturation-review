This can be tested by analyzing the concentration tendency among immigrants who arrive in Japan from overseas and relocate within the country. Using spatial models, we find that immigrants from overseas tend to move to ethnically concentrated regions in Japan, which is in line with SAT. By contrast, this trend substantially weakens with their subsequent domestic relocation, and it differs by national group. The results reveal slow assimilation among nationals from countries characterized as being low-income or culturally dissimilar from Japan. Based on these findings, we discuss potential deficiencies in a new immigration policy (2018), which has been designed to increase the number of immigrants and compensate for a labor shortage in Japan.",NA,NA,"SUSTAINABILITY","Sustainability",NA,"2071-1050",NA,NA,13,"7",NA,NA,16,NA,46,0,0,0,0,"WOS:000638922100001","10.3390/su13073849",NA,"MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,"spatial assimilation; social integration; spatial interaction model; migration; Japan",NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Utilizing the specific case of Japanese and foreigners in Japan, this study aimed to validate Komisarof's framework of workplace belonging. The framework refines understanding of how perceptions of belonging - particularly the degrees to which people see themselves accepted as members of another group's cultural-linguistic community and as core members of their shared work organization - impact quality and effectiveness of intercultural work relations for both migrants and members of the host society. Instruments measuring both dimensions of belonging were validated first through a review of potential items by a panel of experts, followed by an exploratory factor analysis of retained items with a sample of 228 respondents (116 Japanese and 112 non-Japanese representing 24 nationalities). Relationships between four permutations of belonging, termed ontological interpretive spaces (OIS), and four outcome variables (job effectiveness, flourishing, organizational commitment, and intercultural competence) were hypothesized and tested. Significant effects of OIS were found for job effectiveness, flourishing, and organizational commitment, providing evidence of belonging's effects on these crucial acculturation outcomes in intercultural work contexts.",NA,NA,"JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AND INTERCULTURAL COMMUNICATION","Journal Of International And Intercultural Communication","1751-3057","1751-3065",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,22,NA,40,0,0,2,2,"WOS:000632713300001","10.1080/17513057.2021.1897152",NA,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",NA,"Inclusion; acculturation in Japan; migrant belonging; national identity; workplace belonging",NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Both approaches have their merits but also their shortcomings. This paper tries to overcome these shortcomings by combining the advantages of both perspectives to suggest a unified theoretical concept of transnational life courses (TNLC). TNLC builds on the multidimensional understanding of transnational migration research that (potential) migrants live in multiple social and cultural spaces leading to parallel assimilation and dissimilation processes. This perspective is merged with the life course approach with its chronologically ordered understanding of causality relying on preceding determinants and subsequent outcomes in form of events and periods.

Approximately 16% of global refugees resettle in high-income countries which are often culturally very different from their home countries. This can create cross-cultural challenges when accessing health services, leading to inappropriate assessments, diagnoses and treatments if cultural background is not factored in. The impact of culture on the conceptualization and experience of postpartum depression (PPD) amongst migrant women has received growing attention in recent years, however, a specific focus on refugee and asylum-seeking women is lacking. Given the unique mental health challenges refugee women face, it is hypothesized that the interplay between culture and postpartum depression amongst refugee women may differ from other migrant women. Therefore, a scoping review was conducted to characterize what is known about the impact of culture on the conceptualization and experience of PPD in refugee women resettled in high-income countries. Methods and findings This study was conducted as a scoping review in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute's Methodology for Scoping Reviews. A systematic search of studies addressing the relationship between culture and postpartum depression amongst refugee women (including asylum-seeking women) resettled in high-income countries was conducted across 6 databases including MEDLINE, PsycINFO and SOCINDEX between June 2018 and August 2019. A total of 637 articles were found. Studies were eligible if they focused on refugee women who had a pregnancy during forced migration or upon resettlement in a high-income country and focused on the impact of culture on women's conceptualization and/or experience of PPD. Eight studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis, the majority of which were qualitatively driven. Four key themes emerged: 1) there are diverse conceptualizations and experiences of postpartum depression amongst refugee women; 2) mental health stigma has a significant impact on women's conceptualizations and experiences of postpartum depression and help-seeking behaviors; 3) cultural traditions and social support play protective roles in postpartum mental wellbeing; and, 4) host culture has a significant influence on the pregnancy and postpartum experience of refugee women. The overall themes align with those seen in the literature on migrant women in general, however significant research gaps remain. Conclusion The studies identified through this scoping review provide a rich description of the significant impact culture has on the conceptualization and experience of postpartum depression among refugee women resettled in high-income countries. Though overall themes align with those seen in the literature on migrant women in general, further research is needed to better characterize how culture impacts refugee women's experiences of PPD as a distinct sub-group of migrant women.",NA,NA,"PLOS ONE","Plos One","1932-6203",NA,NA,NA,15,"9",NA,NA,21,NA,35,0,0,1,1,"WOS:000568872300029","10.1371/journal.pone.0238109",32870929,"PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","SAN FRANCISCO","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","POSTNATAL DEPRESSION; ASYLUM SEEKERS; IMMIGRANT; ACCULTURATION; SYMPTOMS; SEEKING; HEALTH; RISK; CARE",NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We conducted in-depth interviews with 23 immigrant clients at Federally Qualified Health Care Centers (FQHC) in Southeast Michigan and 28 in-depth interviews with staff at two FQHC's and a non-profit agency serving immigrants. Findings suggest that immigrants face heightened anxiety and adverse mental health outcomes because of unique minority identity-related stressors created by a growing anti-immigrant social environment. Chronic stress experienced stems from restrictive immigration policies, anti-immigrant rhetoric in the media and by political leaders, fear of deportation, discriminatory events, concealment, and internalized anti-immigrant sentiment. Though identity can be an important effect modifier in the stress process, social isolation in the immigrant community has heightened the impact of stress and impeded coping strategies.

The purported difficulty in the assimilation of Muslims in America was linked with their religious affiliation, an indelible marker of their ideology, and one that supersedes any national identity. Given the paucity of research on the assimilation of Muslims in America, this paper sought to explore if-and-how this group is assimilating into American culture. Utilizing a mixed-method design, we conducted focus groups, followed by a multi-state survey. Using segmented assimilation theory, we found evidence that Muslims with higher educational attainment and household incomes are well-assimilated.

Acculturative stress is assumed to be one the reasons for higher prevalence of postnatal depression among immigrant women compared to non-immigrant women. Theories and models of acculturation and coping strategies suggest that certain cultural orientations or behaviors could mitigate acculturative stress and postnatal depression. Nevertheless, quantitative studies applying these theories have so far revealed inconsistent results. Given this background, we ask: what can a qualitative study of immigrant women's postnatal experiences tell us about the interrelationships between immigrant mothers' acculturation behaviors or cultural orientations, and maternal psychological health? Particularly, we explore the postnatal experiences of Chinese and Japanese women who gave birth in Austria, focusing on their experiences and behaviors influenced by their heritage culture's postnatal practices (zuo yue ziandsatogaeri). Theoretically, we apply Berry's acculturation model through a focus on what we call 'Postnatal Acculturative Stress' (PAS). By doing so, we identify factors that prevent or mitigate PAS. Another aim of this article is to critically reassess Berry's model in the context of postnatal care and maternal psychological health. Data were analyzed using a combination of deductive and inductive method through the application of directed content analysis and phenomenological approach. Women's postnatal experiences were summarized as an 'unexpected solitary struggle in the midst of dual identity change' in four specific domains: postnatal rest and diet, social support, feelings toward significant others and identity. Preventive and mitigating factors against PAS included trust (in self and one's health beliefs) and mutual respectful relationships with and between the significant others. The application of Berry's acculturation model provided a useful framework of analysis. Nevertheless, the multifarious complexity involved in the process of acculturation as well as different power dynamics in the family and healthcare settings makes it difficult to draw causal relationships between certain acculturation behaviors or cultural orientations with specific health outcomes.

Method Using a large, national-level sample of Latino native-born and immigrant youth, analyses are conducted using both ordinary least squares (OLS) and logistic regression. Results Findings support hypotheses, showing that increases in cultural retention are associated with less coercion and more social support, both of which are, in turn, related to delinquency.

Not only has the volume of migration substantially increased but also the patterns of migration have become more complex. This paper began by focusing on the drivers of international migration and how health inequalities are linked to migration. Situating migration within the broader structural contexts, the paper calls for using the unharnessed potential of the intersectionality framework to advance immigrant health research. Despite coming from poorer socioeconomic backgrounds and facing disparities in the host society, the immigrants are often paradoxically shown to be healthier than the native population, although this health advantage diminishes over time. Studies on immigrant health, however, are traditionally informed by the acculturation framework which holds the assimilation of unhealthy lifestyles primarily responsible for immigrant health deterioration, diverting the attention away from the structural factors. Although the alternative structural framework came up with the promise to explore the structural factors, it is criticised for an overwhelming focus on access to healthcare and inadequate attention to institutional and societal contexts. However, the heterogeneity of the immigrant population across multiple dimensions of vulnerability demands a novel approach that can bring to the fore both premigratory and postmigratory contextual factors and adequately capture the picture of immigrant health. The paper concludes by questioning the acculturation perspective and pushing the structural paradigm to embrace the intersectionality framework which has the potential to address a wide range of vulnerabilities that intersect to produce health inequalities among the immigrants.",1,NA,"BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH","Bmj Global Health","2059-7908",NA,NA,NA,5,"2",NA,NA,7,NA,66,5,5,0,0,"WOS:000527707600006","10.1136/bmjgh-2019-001938",32180999,"BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP","LONDON","BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON WC1H 9JR, ENGLAND","SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; INTERSECTIONALITY THEORY; FORCED MIGRATION; UNITED-STATES; IMMIGRANT; GENDER; MORTALITY; DISCRIMINATION; SELECTION; MIGRANTS",NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"T-007",NA,1,NA,0,"not acculturation",NA,NA

Drawing upon a case study of a family originating in Calabria, Italy, and living in Adelaide, South Australia, I consider the way in which the three generations perceive their ?being ethnic? across time and space. The first-generation participants were born in Italy and migrated to Australia during the 1950s; the second generation are their children; and the third generation are the children of the second generation. The findings show a widespread intergenerational identification of ethnicity as ?being Italian?, which, however, has different meanings across the three generations. This depends on the participants? phenomenological perceptions of being thrown into the world [Heidegger, M. (1962). Being and time. (J. Macquarie & E. Robinson, Trans.). New York, NY: Harper].

Essential in such a shift of ethnic identity is what I refer to as institutional positionality; that is, one?s perceptions of the position of one?s ?ethnic being in the world?. This is investigated by combining with the sociology of migration, including the Bourdieusian conceptual apparatus of capital [Bourdieu, P. (1986). The forms of capital. In J.

A number of qualitative methods such as in-depth interviews, observation and photographs were used to assess consumers' acculturation strategies in a multicultural environment and how that is influenced by consumer cosmopolitanism. Findings Ethnic consumers' food consumption behaviour reflects their acculturation strategies, which can be classified into four groups: rebellion, rarefaction, resonance and refrainment. This classification demonstrates ethnic consumers' multi-directional acculturation strategies, which are also determined by their level of cosmopolitanism. Originality/value The paper makes original contribution by introducing a multi-directional perspective to acculturation by delineating four-group taxonomy (rebellion, rarefaction, resonance and refrainment).

At the same time, immigrant cohorts are becoming more and more diverse, leading host societies to become increasingly heterogeneous across multiple dimensions. For scholars who study demographic or socio-economic behaviours, the need to account for ethno-cultural super-diversity brings new challenges. OBJECTIVE The main objective of this paper is to present a framework for the prospective analysis of super-diversity in several high immigration countries. METHODS We developed microsimulation models that simultaneously project several population dimensions for Canada, the United States and countries of the European Union, with the aim of studying the consequences of alternate future population and migration trends. RESULTS The paper presents the projected progression of three indicators of diversity: percentage of foreign-born population, percentage of the population using a non-official language at home and percentage of non-Christians. It also examines the projected changes in the labour force by education levels and language. Using alternative scenarios, we also show that the proportion of highly educated in the US and EU28 labour force could increase by 11 and 15 percentage points respectively if future immigrants were selected as in Canada. Finally, the paper proposes a new longitudinal indicator that counts the number of years lived as active and inactive over the life course for foreign-and nativeborn cohorts.

This assumption results in a gap between the origin and destination dimensions of this phenomenon, which may lead to unsatisfactory visiting experiences. In this paper, we conducted a critical review on a wide range of research undertaken on diaspora, migration and home return tourism, and proposed a conceptual framework by synthesizing significant themes in both dimensions identified from the review. The conceptual framework provides a holistic view for researchers and destination managers to examine diaspora tourism. It suggests that the demand dimension of diaspora tourism concerns the structure of diaspora communities; the diasporic individual's migration histories, acculturation level and sense of place will determine their motives to return; the destination dimension involves debates on the issues of why current diasporic destinations and their products may not be able to meet the needs of different types of tourists.

Prior research has shown that PWID who started injecting drugs in Puerto Rico (P.R.) tend to maintain the risky injection behaviors learned there. This study identifies the P.R.-native norms supporting the continued injection risk behavior of migrant Puerto Rican PWID in NYC to inform a culturally appropriate risk-reduction intervention. Methods: 40 migrant Puerto Rican PWID were recruited in NYC for a longitudinal qualitative study. The sample was stratified to include 20 migrants with < 3 years in NYC and 20 migrants with > 3-6 years in NYC. Time-location sampling was used to curb possible network bias in recruitment. Over 12 months, migrants completed semi-structured interviews at baseline, monthly follow-ups, and study exit. Analyses were guided by grounded theory. Results: Most participants (90%) reported having had chronic HCV, and 22.5% reported being HIV-positive. Syringe-and cooker-/cotton-sharing were widespread in both P.R. and NYC. The ubiquitous practice of cleaning used syringes by water-rinsing and air-blowing was guided by a normative belief, learned in P.R., that water and air kill HIV. Sterile syringe use was not a priority. HCV was not a concern. P.R.-native abstinence-only narratives discouraged opioid agonist treatment (OAT) enrollment among recent migrants (<= 3 years). Experiences with drug dealers, prison-power groups, and injection doctors (Gancheros) in P.R. influenced migrants' injection risk behavior in NYC. Those who were Gancheros in P.R. continued working as Gancheros in NYC. Conclusions: Injection risks make migrant Puerto Rican PWID in NYC vulnerable to HIV/HCV. Harm reduction programs should pay closer attention to the rationales behind these injection risks. A risk-reduction intervention that incorporates the Ganchero figure may be a credible way to help migrants reduce injection risk and accept OAT and syringe exchange programs (SEP).",0,"not acculturation","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY","International Journal Of Drug Policy","0955-3959","1873-4758",NA,NA,69,NA,60,"69",10,NA,43,2,2,0,3,"WOS:000474312600010","10.1016/j.drugpo.2019.03.016",31196730,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","AMSTERDAM","PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","EAST HARLEM; HIV; USERS; BEHAVIORS; INFECTION; MORTALITY; VANCOUVER; EPIDEMIC; SYRINGES; BAYAMON","Puerto Rican; Migrant; PWID; Injection risks; New York City; HIV; HCV; Overdose",NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study investigates the migration, work, and adaptation experiences of North Korean escapees living and working in capitalist South Korean society. Using grounded theory methods, we uncover an underlying mechanism of cross-regime work adaptation, the internalization of capitalist work norms into the migrants' personal values. This mechanism is linked with the migrants' adoption of an opportunity-focused approach to the new environment and the emergence of postmigration goals in response to perceived opportunities. This adaptation process is particularly characteristic of those motivated to escape for economic reasons, whereas those motivated to escape by political reasons actually resist assimilation. As a function of pre-and postmigration experiences, individual migrants are found to differ in their internalization of capitalist work norms-from high (integration of norms) to moderate (compliance with norms) to low (resistance to norms). High internalization is linked to such work-related adaptation behaviors such as acquiring new skills and building supportive workplace relationships.

The massive influx of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa exacerbated the growing contradictions in French society related to the colonial past. The author introduces the concept of an interdependent triad of notions tolerance - identity - nationalism and through this concept examines the social processes in the country referring on the latest statistical data. According to the last social surveys, the French overestimate the number of Muslims in the country by 4 times. More than a half of French citizens are against continuing the policy of accepting migrants. The author comes to the conclusion that under the strain of migration flows the French lose both national identity and tolerance towards accepting the culture of the other. However no obvious manifestations of nationalism have been found, but the nationalist's rhetoric is increasingly being used by right-wing parties to gain political points, while the authorities are still in the process of developing a new concept for receiving migrants.

The purpose of this poster is to present and critique the theory chosen as the guiding framework for the first author’s master’s thesis. Chinn and Kramer’s (2011) guide to theory analysis was used to describe and to critically reflect on Baird’s (2012) Theory of Well-Being in Refugee Women Experiencing Cultural Transition. This process enabled the researchers to more thoroughly and critically explore the links between the theory and the proposed research, a qualitative study exploring the health-care experiences of Somali refugee women in Manitoba. Baird developed her theory from the findings of two studies she conducted with refugee women from South Sudan who were living in the United States (2012). Although this theory focuses on well-being and the cultural transition of refugee women, it has theoretical relevance for exploring refugee women’s experiences while accessing health-care services. As a nursing discipline theory, there are many linkages between nurses assisting refugee women to improve their well-being and nurses assisting refugee women to access health-care services. Many of the concepts in the theory have also been identified in the Canadian literature on immigrant and refugee health, whereas other concepts in this theory such as autonomy, mastery of skills, and hope are not as prevalent. Although this theory fits with the proposed research, using an access to health-care framework may add breadth and scope to future studies among refugee populations access to health-care services.",0,"poster not accessible","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITATIVE METHODS","International Journal Of Qualitative Methods","1609-4069",NA,NA,NA,18,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,0,0,0,0,1,"WOS:000456661900027",NA,NA,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","THOUSAND OAKS","2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",NA,NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The spatial characteristics of some fundamental benefits - transport and settlement, fisheries and waste assimilation - of coastal dwelling and their associated environmental costs are first analysed using modern and historical examples. A variety of spatial characteristics describing human use patterns are then identified. On this basis, the implications of the variety of spatial scales in benefits and costs for effective governance are discussed with reference to historical and current marine and coastal management practice.

The paper explores the role of 'spatial mobility' in these classics and its re-emerging importance in more recent social theory. The influence of geography is highlighted, as John Urry's 'mobility turn' draws on the earlier 'spatial turn' of human geographers.

Whereas cross-sectional studies have shown support for these theory-informed relations, comparatively little is known about whether acculturation mismatch negatively affects psychological functioning, or whether offspring's psychological problems precipitate greater perceived acculturation mismatch via intergenerational cultural conflict. Furthermore, more research is needed to investigate how acculturation and family conflict affect Asian Americans transitioning into college and emerging adulthood. Across two measurement occasions, two cohorts of Asian American first-year college students (N = 555, M-age = 17.99, 56.0% women) completed survey questionnaires assessing their perception of parent-offspring acculturation discrepancies, acculturation-related intergenerational conflict, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. For both sets of psychological functioning, gender invariant structural equation models testing the bidirectional relations demonstrated adequate fit for the data. In the case of externalizing symptoms, acculturation mismatch marginally significantly predicted subsequent intergenerational conflict, but acculturation mismatch did not predict externalizing symptoms via intergenerational cultural conflict. By contrast, offspring's internalizing and externalizing symptoms respectively predicted greater self-reported intergenerational cultural conflict, which in turn predicted perceived parent-offspring acculturation mismatch over time. These indirect relations suggested that both internalizing and externalizing symptoms indirectly contributed to greater acculturation mismatch through the presence of intergenerational cultural conflict, but data did not support the acculturation gap-distress theory.

In our theoretical model, when mobility is free, individuals with a stronger taste for their native culture migrate temporarily. When immigration is restricted, however, these individuals are incentivized to relocate permanently. Permanent emigrants procreate in the destination country and convey their cultural traits to the second generation, who will therefore find assimilation harder. We test this prediction by using the 1973 immigration ban in Germany (Anwerbestopp) as a quasi-experiment. Since the ban only concerned immigrants from countries outside the European Economic Community, they act as a treatment group. According to our estimates, the Anwerbestopp has reduced the cultural assimilation of the second generation. This result demonstrated robustness to several checks.

Case-in-point is our understanding of psychophysiological responses to stress which suggest universality despite our knowledge that these pathways are moderated by factors such as ethnicity and culture. Here we discuss the epidemiological phenomenon commonly referred to as the Hispanic health paradox to illustrate the importance of culture in understanding stress.

Methods: Electronic databases Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Knowledge and OECD publications were systematically searched for English language publications from January 2000 to January 2017. A total of 31 qualitative studies were selected and quality appraised and meta-synthesis of the qualitative data was carried out using framework synthesis. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were applied to present the findings. Results: There were no studies on migration motives and one study on integration experiences of international dentists in the UK. The nursing literature had the highest volume and quality of evidence on nursing workforce, whilst there was limited literature on international doctors in the UK. Migration of health professionals to the UK is determined by personal and professional factors, together with source country-specific and UK drivers. Active recruitment, post graduate training and financial gain act as strong common macro, meso and micro drivers that perpetuate migration into the UK, but the extent to which each of these drivers influence nurses' and doctors' migration is different. Integration experiences for international nurses and doctors differed based on their source country experiences and the work environment they entered. Nurses reported a wider knowledge and skills gap, more multi-level discrimination and less career progression compared to the doctors. The migrants' integration experiences depend on their cultural awareness, discrimination exposure, English language and communication skills, social and professional support networks, social integration and personal attributes. Conclusion: Migration of international health professionals is motivated by macro, meso and micro drivers at the international, national, professional and personal levels. The UK has strong common macro pull factors which attract nurses, doctors and dentists and may impact on the effectiveness of policies to restrict their migration. The integration experiences of nurses and doctors differ and further research is required to understand the integration experiences of dentists, in order to retain these professionals by tailoring policies to each of these professions.",1,NA,"HUMAN RESOURCES FOR HEALTH","Human Resources For Health","1478-4491",NA,NA,NA,16,NA,NA,NA,13,NA,60,8,8,0,17,"WOS:000436835600001","10.1186/s12960-018-0293-9",29945616,"BMC","LONDON","CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","QUALIFIED DOCTORS WORKING; OVERSEAS NURSES; CAREER PROGRESSION; BRAIN-DRAIN; EXPERIENCES; UK; COUNTRIES; EU; PROFESSIONALS; BARRIERS","Migration motives; Integration barriers and facilitators; Internationally trained nurses; International medical graduates; International dental graduates",NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"T-016",NA,1,NA,0,"not theory",NA,NA

In this article we analyze the dietary changes experienced by Mexican migrants, employing as a theoretical framework the concept of social practice. According to this framework, practices integrate material elements, meanings and competences that provide their conditions of possibility. Practices are shared by members of social groups, and interact with other competing or reinforcing practices. Between 2014 and 2015, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 27 women, international return migrants living in Tijuana, Mexico. The interview guide asked about history of migration and dietary change. We found three main areas of dietary change: from subsistence farming to ready meals, abundance vs. restriction, and adoption of new food items. The first one was associated with changes in food procurement and female work: when moving from rural to urban areas, participants substituted self-produced for purchased food; and as migrant women joined the labor force, consumption of ready meals increased. The second was the result of changes in income: participants of lower socioeconomic position modified the logic of food acquisition from restriction to abundance and back, depending on the available resources. The third change was relatively minor, with occasional consumption of new dishes or food items, and was associated with exposure to different cuisines and with learning how to cook them. Public health efforts to improve the migrants' diets should take into account the constitutive elements of dietary practices, instead of isolating individuals from their social contexts.

This paper describes the process of theory derivation to develop a strengths-based theory of parental transformation (STPT). We used the theory of well-being of refugee women experiencing cultural transition to gain insights into parents' experiences related to their child's diagnosis.

The emphasis on cultural commonalities between patient and medical staff is as important as the cognition of cultural differences.

Results of migration research show that understanding of disease, expression of pain, therapy expectations, and the subjective beliefs of the cause of disease are dependent on culture. Methods. Using the examples hyperemesis gravidarum, perception and expression of pain as well as subjective disease theory in fibroid patients, cultural influences with regard to clinically relevant aspects are analyzed and our own study results interpreted. Results. In our study, the proportion of migrant women with hyperemesis was disproportionately high. Affected migrant women did not have a higher psychological burden than patients without a migration background. Acculturation stress was not a disease-enhancing factor in our collective. In our survey on ethnicity and pain, patients with a migration background reported >= 5 pain regions significantly more often. The overall results generally confirm that women with a migration background have different lamentation levels. The sociocultural-ethnic background as well as the concrete life situation should always be taken into account when assessing and treating pain. Subjective disease concepts are therapeutically relevant because they can influence compliance, disease history, and treatment efficacy as well as symptom awareness and treatment expectation.

A systematic literature review about the conceptualization and measurement of international relocation mobility readiness",0,"not migration","Purpose Employees' readiness to relocate abroad plays a crucial role for the success or failure of expatriate assignments. Hence, companies should consider employees' international relocation mobility readiness (IRMR) when selecting candidates for international postings. However, past research has conceptualized and measured IRMR heterogeneously, hampering the interpretation and comparability of IRMR research results. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to provide a new conceptualization of IRMR and to give recommendations for its measurement. Design/methodology/approach Based on the business, psychological and sociological literature, this paper reviews and categorizes how IRMR has been conceptualized and measured. To structure the findings, a directed content analysis was applied. The sample comprises 88 journal articles. Findings The results reveal that studies seldom provide a conceptualization of IRMR. While the authors often find a misfit between the studies' explicit conceptualization and the actual measurement of IRMR, most scales actually measure willingness (i.e. usually a predictor of risky and spontaneous behavior). Research limitations/implications Based on the results and the Rubicon model of action phases (Heckhausen and Gollwitzer, 1987), the authors recommend future research to conceptualize IRMR as a dynamic multidimensional construct, covering the different phases of an individual's decision to relocate internationally. Future, IRMR measurements should also cover the complexity of IRMR, e.g. regarding specific location characteristics. Practical implications Companies should consider the whole decision-making process regarding IRMR to apply specific measures at the best possible time.

This article contributes a quantitative assessment of cannabis normalization as differentiated by social location predictors. Methods: Logistic and zero-inflated negative binomial regression models assess three areas of cannabis normalization: accessibility, acceptability, and recent use. Peer network cannabis use prevalence, gender, nativity, campus locale and living arrangement are explored as focal predictors of variation in normalization among 1,713 cannabis using and nonusing undergraduate students in Canada. Results: Women report lower odds of positive cannabis acceptability attitudes. While women report lower rates of recent cannabis use, gender is not a significant predictor for lifetime prevalence. Being a recent immigrant significantly predicts lower recent use, lower odds of favorable attitudes to cannabis, and reduced accessibility in comparison to students born in Canada. Longer-term immigrants do not show significant differences from students born in Canada on accessibility and acceptability, suggesting a substance use acculturation effect. Lower peer cannabis use prevalence exhibits a protective effect against use. In comparison to students who report that some of their peer network uses cannabis, those with all users in their network exhibit lower acceptability attitudes. This suggests a threshold relationship between peer use prevalence and acceptability.

Thus, the purpose of this paper is to explore the social transition of young Vietnamese migrants into city life. Design/methodology/approach In-depth interviews were conducted among ten female and six male temporary unmarried migrants, between ages of 18 and 25 years, currently living in Ha Noi through purposive sampling. Findings Despite a higher income in the city, young migrants often suffer from physical and mental health strains that decrease their overall well-being, caused by the factors such as barriers to assimilation to new lifestyles, continued attachment to origin hometowns, financial pressures, and poor living conditions. Important aspects in pre-migration expectations and actual experiences influenced the psychosocial well-being of these young migrants as they transitioned into adulthood during their migration process. Migration to the city and assimilation into city life also changed young migrants' views on lifestyles and behaviors often considered misconducts in their rural hometowns, such as premarital sex.

Immigrants and their children can make claims to modify the normative content of citizenship, affect recognition evaluations and change the allocation of status and rights. But they are also constrained by legal structures, a society's institutional practices, and prevailing public perceptions. Citizenship as claims-making may require a reassessment of boundary approaches and a turn to metaphors of positionality, as well as more serious commitment to mixed-methods research.

Diet and physical activity behaviours contribute to this risk, shaped by a system of inter-related factors. This study mapped a systems-based framework of the factors influencing dietary and physical activity behaviours in ethnic minority populations living in Europe, to inform research prioritisation and intervention development. Methods: A concept mapping approach guided by systems thinking was used: i. Preparation (protocol and terminology); ii. Generating a list of factors influencing dietary and physical activity behaviours in ethnic minority populations living in Europe from evidence (systematic mapping reviews) and ` eminence' (89 participants from 24 academic disciplines via brainstorming, an international symposium and expert review) and; iii. Seeking consensus on structuring, rating and clustering factors, based on how they relate to each other; and iv. Interpreting/utilising the framework for research and interventions. Similar steps were undertaken for frameworks developed for the majority European population. Results: Seven distinct clusters emerged for dietary behaviour (containing 85 factors) and 8 for physical activity behaviours (containing 183 factors). Four clusters were similar across behaviours: Social and cultural environment; Social and material resources; Psychosocial; and Migration context. Similar clusters of factors emerged in the frameworks for diet and physical activity behaviours of the majority European population, except for ` migration context'. The importance of factors across all clusters was acknowledged, but their relative importance differed for ethnic minority populations compared with the majority population. Conclusions: This systems-based framework integrates evidence from both expert opinion and published literature, to map the factors influencing dietary and physical activity behaviours in ethnic minority groups. Our findings illustrate that innovative research and complex interventions need to be developed that are sensitive to the needs of ethnic minority populations. A systems approach that encompasses the complexity of the inter-related factors that drive behaviours may inform a more holistic public health paradigm to more effectively reach ethnic minorities living in Europe, as well as the majority host population.",0,"not acculturation","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY","International Journal Of Behavioral Nutrition And Physical Activity","1479-5868",NA,NA,NA,14,NA,NA,NA,15,NA,49,10,10,1,11,"WOS:000414670200001","10.1186/s12966-017-0608-6",29115995,"BMC","LONDON","CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","PUBLIC-HEALTH; DISEASE RISK; PREVENTION; FOOD; INTERVENTIONS; IMMIGRANTS; OBESITY; ORIGIN; ACCULTURATION; EXPERIENCES","Minority populations; Europe; Migrants; Immigrants; Physical activity; Sedentary behaviour; Diet; Framework; Systems",NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The article detects that in contemporary liberal theories, assigning an independent normative value to time spent by the migrant in the receiving country is a key move in balancing the competing interests of migrants and of the migrant-receiving country, where the right of the country to regulate migration is taken as given: the longer a migrant is present in a country, the stronger her interests become in receiving citizenship status or treatment akin to citizens. The article then surveys the case law of the ECtHR relating to long-term migrants. It finds that time is often one of multiple normative considerations in the balancing exercise, in conjunction with whether a migrant has achieved social integration in the migrant-receiving country and whether the right of the receiving community to regulate migration for reasons of affording citizenship, national security or distributive justice is paramount. The article argues that the lack of an independent normative weight afforded to time in the case law of the ECtHR is not merely a tension between the translation of liberal normative theory to legal policy. It also shows a deeper tension in liberal theories of migration between national liberalism and cosmopolitan liberalism.",NA,NA,"ISRAEL LAW REVIEW","Israel Law Review","0021-2237","2047-9336",NA,NA,50,"3",447,"462",16,NA,23,0,0,0,2,"WOS:000416761000010",NA,NA,"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","NEW YORK","32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","IMMIGRATION CONTROLS","jus temporis; long-term migrants; liberal theories of migration; European Court of Human Rights",NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Therefore, we developed a method that enables us to systematically compare CCMRs (cross-cultural migrations per capita) through time and space. This CCMR method puts issues of state policies and citizenship in a much broader social context. We conclude that the presentist approach to migration in the social sciences is highly myopic, as it privileges migrations crossing state borders over internal moves, and favors migrants who have the intention to settle for good. In itself this is a legitimate choice, especially if the core explanandum is the way migrants' long-term settlement process in another (modern) state evolves. In the more empirical parts of this article however we have concentrated on the effects of Eurasian societies since 1500 that have received migrants. Sending societies and individual migrants and nonmigrants in sending and receiving societies have been largely left out. Finally, and paradoxically, integration and assimilation in the long run leads to diminishing opportunities of social development by cross-cultural experiences, because one could argue that due to globalizing migrations cultures converge further and thus cultural boundaries (as is already the case in migration to cities within culturally homogenous nation-states in the twentieth century) become less salient or disappear entirely.

This study extends the theory of person organization fit in the context of hospitality migrant workers. This study also examines the effect of person-organization fit on migrant workers' turnover intentions via job satisfaction and work adjustment. The results reveal that all three levels of fit, person-supervisor, person-group, and person-job, have a significant influence on work adjustment and job satisfaction, which in turn influence migrant employees' turnover intentions. Among the three types of fit, person-group fit was the only one to have a direct effect on predicting turnover intentions.

"95","WebOfScience","Article",2017,"Repke, L; Benet-Martinez, V","Conceptualizing the Dynamics between Bicultural Identification and Personal Social Networks",1,NA,"An adequate understanding of the acculturation processes affecting immigrants and their descendants involves ascertaining the dynamic interplay between the way these individuals manage their multiple (and sometimes conflictual) cultural value systems and identifications and possible changes in their social networks. To fill this gap, the present research examines how key acculturation variables (e.g., strength of ethnic/host cultural identifications, bicultural identity integration or BII) relate to the composition and structure of bicultural individuals' personal social networks. In Study 1, we relied on a generationally and culturally diverse community sample of 123 Latinos residing in the US. Participants nominated eight individuals (i.e., alters) from their habitual social networks and across two relational domains: friendships and colleagues. Results indicated that the interconnection of same ethnicity alters across different relationship domains is linked to cultural identifications, while the amount of coethnic and host individuals in the network is not. In particular, higher interconnection between Latino friends and colleagues was linked to lower levels of U.S. identification. Conversely, the interconnection of non-Latino friends and colleagues was associated with lower levels of Latino identification. This pattern of results suggests that the relational context for each type of cultural identification works in a subtractive and inverse manner. Further, time spent in the US was linked to both Latino and U.S. cultural identifications, but this relationship was moderated by the level of BII. Specifically, the association between time in the US and strength of both cultural identities was stronger for individuals reporting low levels of BII. Taking the findings from Study 1 as departure point, Study 2 used an agent-based model data simulation approach to explore the dynamic ways in which the content and the structure of an immigrant's social network might matter over time in predicting three possible identity patterns: coexisting cultural identifications, conflicting cultural identifications, and a mixture of the two. These simulations allowed us to detect network constellations, which lead to identification or disidentification with both cultures. We showed that distinct patterns of social relations do not lead to identity outcomes in a deterministic fashion, but that often many different outcomes are probable.",0,"not theory","FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY","Frontiers In Psychology","1664-1078",NA,NA,NA,8,NA,NA,NA,19,NA,66,10,10,0,18,"WOS:000397996200001","10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00469",28408892,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","LONGITUDINAL TEST; IDENTITY; ACCULTURATION; BEHAVIOR; CULTURE; ADOLESCENTS; PREDICTION; COMPONENTS; LANGUAGE; PROTOCOL","social networks; acculturation; immigration; cultural identification; complex contagions",NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study aimed to identify the predominant culture within the Palestinian Primary Healthcare Centers of the Ministry of Health (PHC-MoH) and the Primary Healthcare Centers of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (PHC-UNRWA) by using the competing values framework (CVF) and examining its influence on the adherence to the Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) for DM. Methods: A cross-sectional design was employed with a census sample of all the Palestinian family doctors and nurses (n= 323) who work within 71 PHC clinic. A cross-cultural adaptation framework was followed to develop the Arabic version of the CVF questionnaire. Results: The overall adherence level to the diabetic guideline was disappointingly suboptimal (51.5%, p< 0.001; 47.3% in the PHC-MoH and 55.5% in the PHC-UNRWA).

Latino mothers were targeted to understand their beliefs about children's healthy eating needs and identify communication campaign opportunities that would reinforce choices made in the home, surrounding meal planning, food selection and preparation and portion sizes. Design/methodology/approach - A sequential mixed-methods approach using focus group, group interview and qualitative message concept testing was used in three distinct stages of research exploration. An independent sample was recruited at each stage through convenience sampling and snowball sampling methods. The stages of change theory provided a framework for research inquiry in the context of healthy eating- at- home practices. Findings - In general, mothers were aware and participatory in the effort to serve healthy meals for their children at home. The time and money associated with buying nutritious foods and cooking healthy meals daily was stressful, but they were receptive to communication efforts to help them maintain their commitment to give their children healthy foods. These findings provided directional opportunities for the discovery and implementation of health communication strategies. Test results found that the target was most receptive to message strategies that acknowledged the responsibility of both parents to model healthy eating practices to children. Research limitations/implications - Recruiting resulted in small sample sizes at each stage of the investigation. The reliability of quantitative measurement was a limitation to the research conclusions. Practical implications - Partnership with the audience from discovery to conceptualization resulted in messages that uniquely resonated with the audience for which they were aimed. Understanding about the target stage of readiness improves message effectiveness to the target group. Social implications - Health communication campaigns planned and developed with the target audience at its center will generate message strategies that effectively address issues of greatest relevance to those communication agents that seek to change.

Transnational mobility has called into question dominant notions of migrant acculturation or assimilation. Migrants no longer feel obligated to remain tied to or locatable in a given, unitary culture. Rather, they are becoming embedded within a shifting field of increasingly transcultural identities. While migrants are becoming more transnational and adopting fluid, transcultural identities, there is a lack of focus and engagement with transnationalism as well as transculturalism in the official Canadian public school curricula. As scholars contend, Canadian school curricula are still based on Eurocentric, homogenizing, nationalistic discourses that tend to normalize values, norms, and behaviours that are perceived as different from the dominant norm. In response to the limitations of Canadian official curricula, as noted by various scholars who have examined curriculum documents, this essay proposes a revision of Canadian curricula in the context of transnational mobility with the aim of developing an approach that would integrate transnational and transcultural perspectives into the existing system.

Latino/a youth are at risk for alcohol use. This risk seems to rise with increasing US cultural orientation and decreasing Latino cultural orientation, especially among girls. To ascertain how acculturation may influence Latino/a youth alcohol use, we integrated an expanded multi-domain model of acculturation with the Theory of Reasoned Action.Design. Participants were 302 recent Latino/a immigrant youth (141 girls, 160 boys; 152 from Miami, 150 from Los Angeles) who completed surveys at 4 time points. Youth completed measures of acculturation, attitudes toward drinking, perceived subjective norms regarding alcohol use, intention to drink, and alcohol use.Results. Structural equation modeling indicated that collectivistic values predicted more perceived disapproval of drinking, which negatively predicted intention to drink. Intention to drink predicted elevated alcohol use.Conclusion. Although the association between collectivistic values and social disapproval of drinking was relatively small ( = .19, p < .05), findings suggest that collectivistic values may help protect Latino/a immigrant youth from alcohol use by influencing their perceived social disapproval of drinking, leading to lower intention to drink. Educational preventive interventions aimed at reducing or preventing alcohol use in recent Latino/a immigrant youth could promote collectivistic values and disseminate messages about the negative consequences of drinking.",NA,NA,"ETHNICITY & HEALTH","Ethnicity & Health","1355-7858","1465-3419",NA,NA,21,"6",609,"627",19,NA,48,7,7,0,48,"WOS:000384015600007","10.1080/13557858.2016.1179723",27220730,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","HISPANIC COLLEGE-STUDENTS; SUBSTANCE USE; DRUG-USE; PLANNED BEHAVIOR; ADOLESCENTS; INVARIANCE; ATTITUDES; AMERICAN; DRINKING; IDENTITY","Acculturation; alcohol use; Theory of Reasoned Action; Latino; a youth; gender",NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We present a theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of policy decisions about immigrant inclusion. We apply the framework to investigate the effect of the state safety net on educational attainment. We focus on the years following welfare reform in 1996, when states gained considerable autonomy over welfare policy, including decisions about the eligibility of immigrant residents. Leveraging state-level data from before and after reform, we estimate a difference-in-difference model to identify the effect of variation in immigrant inclusivity on educational attainment. We find that when states broaden the inclusivity of the social safety net to immigrants, young Latinos are more likely to graduate from high school. This effect is present beyond the group of Latino residents who receive additional benefits, suggesting that policy decisions about immigrants spill over to broader communities and communicate broader messages about social inclusion to racial and ethnic groups. We find similar patterns among Asian youth, but not among black and non-Hispanic white youth.

Existing programs tend to conflate issues related to immigrant status with ethnic or racial minorities. These programs also tend to ignore that acculturation and cultural discourse in health may vary depending on the immigrant subgroup and the host community's social environment. This paper addresses the gap in the literature by proposing a conceptual framework that uses a socioecological perspective to outline acculturation and cultural factors in immigrants' preventive health behaviours. To this end, we synthesized the literature on acculturation and cultural perspectives on preventive health among immigrants. We used a case study on influenza vaccination among Chinese immigrants to illustrate the importance of targeting and tailoring approaches to specific immigrant subgroups. We performed a critical examination of 10 existing influenza vaccination programs adapted for immigrants and ethnic minorities to outline their cultural sensitivity in surface- and deep- structure components. Finally, we proposed a conceptual framework integrating the acculturation factors, cultural elements, and cultural anatomy of the reviewed programs with application to Chinese immigrants as a demonstration of cultural sensitivity.

For the most part, however, these treatments have been validated in resource-rich settings and with individuals whose traumatic experiences are not ongoing. Many children living in conflict-affected settings experience symptoms of PTSD, and there are emerging data to support the effective generalization of evidence-based paradigms across contexts. Yet there remains a need for a deeper examination of the adaptation and implementation of evidence-based care in conflict-affected settings given the unique characteristics of providing care in these contexts. The aim of the current review is to provide an integrative social-ecological framework for the adaptation and implementation of child PTSD treatment in conflict-affected settings that synthesizes basic research and treatment evaluations. In summary, there is strong evidence to suggest the utility of evidence-based treatments for child PTSD in conflict-affected settings, but several recommendations regarding adaptation and implementation are evident. Because children in these contexts are likely to have ongoing exposure to violence and adversity, treatment adaptations should deeply consider how to deliver individual-level treatment for child PTSD with multisystemic supports. Identifying culturally relevant ways of delivering care within a multisystemic framework that maintains core effective mechanisms of treatment will necessarily involve emic investigations and should draw on the expertise of local professionals and paraprofessionals.",NA,NA,"PEACE AND CONFLICT-JOURNAL OF PEACE PSYCHOLOGY","Peace And Conflict-Journal Of Peace Psychology","1078-1919","1532-7949",NA,NA,22,"3",262,"271",10,NA,104,4,4,1,5,"WOS:000383593100009","10.1037/pac0000190",NA,"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","WASHINGTON","750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; MENTAL-HEALTH INTERVENTION; POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS SYMPTOMS; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE; PSYCHOSOCIAL TREATMENTS; CULTURAL-ADAPTATION; POLITICAL VIOLENCE; REFUGEE CHILDREN; OUTCOME RESEARCH","posttraumatic stress; violence; conflict; postconflict; children",NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Method: Large-scale survey data are used in 2 studies, capturing 6 recent immigrant groups (Afghanis, Chinese, Iranians, Iraqis, Polish, and Somalis; Study 1, N = 5,877) and immigrants from Turkey (Study 2, N = 427) to The Netherlands. We investigate the associations between the different measures of dual identity as well as how each relates to indicators of intergroup relations (perceived subgroup respect and perceived discrimination) and immigrants' psychological outcomes (feeling at home in The Netherlands, happiness, affect toward the Dutch). Results: The findings show that dual self-identification differs most markedly from high identification on separate ethnic and national identities. The latter conceptualization largely overlaps with the strength of dual identification, both in terms of the classification of who is a dual identifier, as well as the associations with intergroup relations and immigrants' psychological outcomes.

The findings suggest that the association declines rapidly as the distance moved increases, but it remains robust even at long distances. It is also stronger for African Americans and more assimilated Latinos than for whites and less assimilated Latinos. These findings suggests that to some extent, young white, African American, and Latino adults are residentially segregated from each other because they grew up that way.

The present research proposed a construct termed global orientation to denote individual differences in the psychological processes of acculturating to the globalizing world. It encompasses multicultural acquisition as a proactive response and ethnic protection as a defensive response to globalization. Ten studies examined the applicability of global orientations among majority and minority groups, including immigrants and sojourners, in multicultural and relatively monocultural contexts, and across Eastern and Western cultures. Multicultural acquisition is positively correlated with both independent and interdependent self-construals, bilingual proficiency and usage, and dual cultural identifications. Multicultural acquisition is promotion-focused, while ethnic protection is prevention-focused and related to acculturative stress.

The paper engages in both theoretical and empirical assessment. We critically examine the concept of mode of incorporation, demonstrating that its operational implications have not been correctly understood; consequently, the core hypothesis has never been appropriately tested.

In Mexico, exclusive breast-feeding under 6 months of age has deteriorated among the poor, rural and indigenous populations from 1999 to 2012. Our objective of the present study was to identify the main social obstacles to breast-feeding in a low-income population in Tijuana, Mexico. Design: Qualitative study using a socio-ecological framework for data collection. Setting: Low-income communities in Tijuana, Mexico. Subjects: Mothers (n 66), fathers (n 11), grandparents (n 27) and key informants (n 25). Results: One hundred and twenty-nine individuals participated in the study: six focus groups (n 53) and fifty-one interviews among mothers, fathers and grandparents; and twenty-five interviews among key informants. Seven social themes were identified: (i) embarrassment to breast-feed in public; (ii) migrant experience; (iii) women's role in society; (iv) association of formula with higher social status; (v) marketing by the infant food industry; (vi) perception of a non-breast-feeding culture; and (vii) lack of breast-feeding social programmes. Conclusions: Socio-structural factors influence infant feeding practices in low-income communities in Tijuana.

Methods: We used data from a longitudinal survey (German Socio-economic Panel). Immigrants were identified by country of birth (Turkey: respondents n = 828, observations n = 3871; Eastern Europe: respondents n = 2009, observations n = 7202; non-immigrants: respondents n = 34,011, observations n = 140,701). Smoking status data was available for nine years between 1998 and 2012. Length of stay (LOS, in years) was used as proxy for acculturation. We calculated smoking prevalences, prevalence ratios and a random intercept multilevel logistic regression model. Results: With each year spent in Germany, smoking prevalence increases among Turkish women (OR = 1.14 (95%CI = 1.06-1.21)) and slightly decreases among men. Recently immigrated Turkish women smoke less than non-immigrant women (0-5 years: SPR = 0.25 (95%CI = 0.10-0.57)); prevalences converge with increasing LOS (31+ years: SPR = 1.25 (95%CI = 1.06-1.48)). Among Eastern European immigrants no significant changes were apparent. Conclusions: Immigrants from Turkey import their smoking prevalence from a country which is in the earlier stages of the smoking epidemic. With increasing LOS (thus, advancing acculturation), they move to the later stages. Anti-smoking interventions should consider different smoking attitudes in Turkey/Germany and need to discourage women from initiating smoking.

Most interpretations of these health patterns by duration of U.S. residence rely on theories of immigrant integration; they posit that with increasing time in the United States, immigrants incorporate economically, socially, and culturally into aspects of U.S. society, and that these changes impact health. Few studies empirically examine whether these aspects of integration are indeed mediators of the association between duration of U.S. stay and BMI, and if their patterns differ across immigrant subgroups. This study examines data from the National Latino and Asian American Survey, using path analytic methods to simultaneously test six hypothesized mediators between duration and BMI: household income, English language ability, ethnic identity, family cohesion, acculturative stress and discrimination for both Latino and Asian immigrants, stratified by gender. We find little evidence for an association between duration and BMI for either Latino or Asian men. For women, duration and BMI have a significant and positive relationship, although the pathways differ between the two ethnic groups. For Latina women, household income and acculturative stress are significant indirect pathways, although they work in opposing directions. For Asian women, English proficiency and discrimination are significant indirect pathways. Our findings reveal complex pathways between duration and BMI that vary by ethnicity and gender and highlight limitations in the negative acculturation theory, which suggests that exposure to the United States should have a net negative impact on health. In contrast, our findings suggest that not all groups show declining health with longer duration, as measured by BMI, and that integration processes do not always translate into health differences in the expected directions. Future research on duration patterns may need to consider alternative explanations beyond incorporation-based processes, such as cross-national health theories or age, period, cohort effects.

It expressed a new appreciation of the danger to Whites of conflict based on colour. Before 1905 most observers assumed the inferiority of Blacks and saw race conflict as the fault of African Americans. But a new possibility arose when the fate of African Americans was linked to the rising power of Japan, occurring after the defeat of Russia by Japan in 1904-5. Race conflict, in this new model, was a form of conflict between nations. Race relations pioneer Robert E. Park, in his 1913 article, Racial Assimilation in Secondary Groups', noted that under conditions. . . of individual liberty and individual competition, characteristic of modern civilization, depressed racial groups tend to assume the form of nationalities. A nationality, in this narrower sense, may be defined as the racial group which has attained self-consciousness, no matter whether it has at the same time gained political independence or not.' Yuill's paper will explore the thesis that a liberal perspective based on developments in contemporary international relations slowly changed the way race was regarded in the United States.

We sought to understand the multiple influences on behaviour (hence risks to metabolic health) of South Asian mothers and their unborn child, theorise how these influences interact and build over time, and inform the design of culturally congruent, multi-level interventions. Methods: Our sample for this qualitative study was 45 women of Bangladeshi, Indian, Sri Lankan, or Pakistani origin aged 21-45 years with a history of diabetes in pregnancy, recruited from diabetes and antenatal services in two deprived London boroughs. Overall, 17 women shared their experiences of diabetes, pregnancy, and health services in group discussions and 28 women gave individual narrative interviews, facilitated by multilingual researchers, audiotaped, translated, and transcribed. Data were analysed using the constant comparative method, drawing on sociological and narrative theories. Results: Key storylines (over-arching narratives) recurred across all ethnic groups studied. Short-term storylines depicted the experience of diabetic pregnancy as stressful, difficult to control, and associated with negative symptoms, especially tiredness. Taking exercise and restricting diet often worsened these symptoms and conflicted with advice from relatives and peers. Many women believed that exercise in pregnancy would damage the fetus and drain the mother's strength, and that eating would be strength-giving for mother and fetus. These short-term storylines were nested within medium-term storylines about family life, especially the cultural, practical, and material constraints of the traditional South Asian wife and mother role and past experiences of illness and healthcare, and within longer-term storylines about genetic, cultural, and material heritage -including migration, acculturation, and family memories of food insecurity.

Conclusions: 'Behaviour change' interventions aimed at preventing and managing diabetes in South Asian women before and during pregnancy are likely to be ineffective if delivered in a socio-cultural vacuum.

To encourage research on immigrants and aging by analyzing theoretical commonalities in the two fields and identifying potential contributions of aging theories, specifically to the understanding of neglected age differences in the pace of immigrant incorporation. Methods. Survey of the historical development of assimilation theory and its successors and systematic comparison of key concepts in aging and immigrant incorporation theories. Results. Studies of immigrants, as well as of the life course, trace their origins to the Chicago School at the turn of the 20th century. Today, both theoretical perspectives emphasize adaptation as a time-dependent, multidimensional, nonlinear, and multidirectional process. Immigrant incorporation theories have not fully engaged with a key concern of aging theory-why there are age differences. Insights from cognitive aging and developmental biology, life-span developmental psychology, and age stratification and the life course suggest explanations for age differences in the speed of immigrant incorporation. Discussion. Theories of adaptation to aging and theories of immigrant incorporation developed so independently that they neglected the subject they have in common, namely, older immigrants.

A theoretical model, which was developed based on transitions theory and the midlife women's attitudes toward physical activity theory, consists of 4 major variables, including length of stay in the United States, country of birth, level of acculturation, and midlife women's physical activity. To test the theoretical model, a secondary analysis with data from 127 Hispanic women and 123 non-Hispanic (NH) Asian women in a national Internet study was used. Among the major variables of the model, length of stay in the United States was negatively associated with physical activity in Hispanic women. Level of acculturation in NH Asian women was positively correlated with women's physical activity. Country of birth and level of acculturation were significant factors that influenced physical activity in both Hispanic and NH Asian women. The findings support the theoretical model that was developed to examine relationships between immigration transition and physical activity; it shows that immigration transition can play an essential role in influencing health behaviors of immigrant populations in the United States.

This concept helps us to fill the gap between scholars of migration and people's movement on the one hand, and scholars of integration and incorporation in the new country, on the other hand.

This paper presents a conceptual map that allows tracing emerging and proposed forms of citizenship within and beyond the nation state in a comprehensive and differentiated way. We disentangle two anchor points: membership in a political community as the fundament of citizenship and the arena of political decision-making as the focal point of citizenship rights, identities and practices. For the former we differentiate between a single national community, the universal community of humankind and multiple (national) communities. For the latter we distinguish the national, supra-national and transnational arena. Our typology thus consists of nine different forms of democratic citizenship. It is used to provide a brief overview over normative proposals and empirical findings leading to the following insights: while membership in a particular national community still dominates the reality in all three political arenas, in the normative discourse it is perceived as deficient. Membership in the universal community of humankind is widely endorsed in the normative discourse, but almost nonexistent.

A Critical Review of the Negative Acculturation Theory among Asian Immigrants",1,NA,"Researchers have become increasingly interested in the health patterns of immigrants with longer residence in the United States, as this reveals the health consequences of integration processes. The negative acculturation effect has been the dominant interpretation of duration patterns, despite empirical and theoretical uncertainties about this assumption. This theory assumes that immigrant health declines with longer residence in the United States because of poorer health behaviors and health risks that reflect Americanized lifestyles. This paper reviews the empirical support for the negative acculturation theory among Asian immigrants to determine if and when it is an appropriate interpretation for duration patterns. I conclude that empirical inconsistencies and methodological issues limit the negative acculturation theory as the primary interpretation for duration patterns. First, there is no consistent evidence that health behaviors decline with time. There is also substantial group heterogeneity in duration patterns as well as heterogeneity across health outcomes. The literature has not adequately addressed methodological shortcomings, such as confounding by cohort effects or non-linear duration patterns. Length of residence in the United States is still an important aspect of Asian immigrant health, but the mechanisms of this relationship are still understudied.

From participants' descriptions of family challenges emerged a picture of a social ecology in flux, with traditional, socially conservative modes of resolving family conflict transposed across migration into the more liberal and state-oriented familial context of the United States. This transposition results in a loss spiral for the traditional social ecology, differentially affecting individual actors within families.

Although research using this approach, including that by Kershaw et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2013;177(4):299-309), has been valuable, I argue that to advance our understanding of how residential segregation influences health and health disparities, it is critical to incorporate a life-course perspective and integrate social theory. Applying a life-course perspective would entail modeling transitions, cumulative risk, and developmental and dynamic processes and mechanisms, as well as recognizing the contingency of contextual effects on different social groups. I discuss the need for analytic methods appropriate for modeling health effects of distal causes experienced across the life course, such as segregation, that operate through multiple levels and sequences of mediators, potentially across decades. Sociological theories of neighborhood attainment (e. g., segmented assimilation, ethnic resurgence, and place stratification theories) can guide effect-modification tests to help illuminate health effects resulting from intersections of residential processes, race/ethnicity, immigration, and other social determinants of health.

This line of inquiry is often approached as a specialty topic involving a discrete de-contextualized population, rather than a topic that is central for understanding patterns of population health within and between sending and receiving countries. Frequently immigrant health research employs theoretical frameworks (e.g., acculturation) that emphasize cultural explanations, while less commonly utilized is the social determinants of health framework, which emphasizes social and structural explanations. Drawing upon literature in the fields of economics, sociology of immigration, and social epidemiology, we present a conceptual framework for understanding immigrant health from a cross-national perspective. We discuss the theoretical foundations of this framework; the methodological challenges for undertaking research on immigration and health using this framework; examples of emerging research in this area; and directions for future research. Progress in immigrant health research and population health improvements can be achieved through an enhanced understanding of population health patterns in sending and receiving societies. Immigrant health research needs to be better integrated into social epidemiology. Concurrently, immigrant health research offers conceptual, empirical, and analytic opportunities to advance social epidemiological research. Together, scholarship in immigrant health and social epidemiology can make significant contributions toward one of their mutual and ultimate goals: to improve knowledge about population health.

The over reliance on cultural explanations for immigrant health outcomes has been the topic of growing debate, with the critics' main concern being that such explanations obscure the impact of structural factors on immigrant health disparities. In this paper, we highlight the shortcomings of cultural explanations as currently employed in the health literature, and argue for a shift from individual culture-based frameworks, to perspectives that address how multiple dimensions of inequality intersect to impact health outcomes. Based on our review of the literature, we suggest specific lines of inquiry regarding immigrants' experiences with day-to-day discrimination, as well as on the roles that place and immigration policies play in shaping immigrant health outcomes.

Results provide partial support for the validity of the framework in which mothers' acculturative status and socialization of respeto (a Latino cultural value of respect) and independence (a U.S. American cultural value) predict parenting practices. For both groups, English language competence was related to less socialization of respeto, and other domains of acculturative status (i.e., U.S. American/ethnic identity, and U.S. American/ethnic cultural competence) were related to more socialization of respeto and independence. Socialization of respeto was related to the use of authoritarian practices and socialization of independence was related to the use of authoritative practices. Socialization of respeto was also related to lower school readiness for DA children, whereas socialization of independence was related to higher school readiness for MA children. Independence was also related to higher teacher-rated externalizing problems for MA children.

Participants were presented with a fictitious interview with an African immigrant whose generational Status, desire for Culture Maintenance and Intercultural Contact (Study 1) or host Culture Adoption (Study 2) were manipulated (2 x 2 x 2 design). Results showed that both perceived desire for contact and for culture adoption positively affected host members' attitudes, and that the culture adoption attitudes relationship was partially mediated by perceived threat. These effects were stronger than those attributable to perceived Culture Maintenance. The latter variable moderated the Desire for Contact but not the Desire for Culture Adoption main effect. Moreover, Contact and Culture Adoption and generational Status all influenced the way in which host members perceived immigrants sociocultural adjustment.

In the present study, the AIM was assessed among high-school adolescents who immigrated from Russia and Ukraine to Israel as part of an educational program (n = 151). The adolescents completed questionnaires twice: half a year before and three years after their immigration. In accordance with the theoretical model, attitudes towards the country of origin and the host country and perceived environmental constraints (including perceived discrimination as well as perceived social support from parents, peers, and teachers) affected the immigrants' acculturation intentions.

However, the MC hosts some of the world's most complicated meteorology, and we wish to understand how tropical phenomena at a range of scales influence observed burning activity. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived active fire hotspot patterns coupled with aerosol data assimilation products, satellite based precipitation, and meteorological indices, the meteorological context of observed fire prevalence and smoke optical depth in the MC are examined. Relationships of burning and smoke transport to such meteorological and climatic factors as the interannual El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), El Nino Modoki, Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), the seasonal migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, the 30-90 day Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO), tropical waves, tropical cyclone activity, and diurnal convection were investigated. A conceptual model of how all of the differing meteorological scales affect fire activity is presented. Each island and its internal geography have different sensitivities to these factors which are likely relatable to precipitation patterns and land use practices. At the broadest scales as previously reported, we corroborate ENSO is indeed the largest factor. However, burning is also enhanced by periods of El Nino Modoki. Conversely, IOD influences are unclear. While interannual phenomena correlate to total seasonal burning, the MJO largely controls when visible burning occurs. High frequency phenomena which are poorly constrained in models such as diurnal convection and tropical cyclone activity also have an impact which cannot be ignored. Finally, we emphasize that these phenomena not only influence burning, but also the observability of burning, further complicating our ability to assign reasonable emissions.",NA,NA,"ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS","Atmospheric Chemistry And Physics","1680-7316","1680-7324",NA,NA,12,"4",2117,"2147",31,NA,140,85,85,0,30,"WOS:000300875900027","10.5194/acp-12-2117-2012",NA,"COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH","GOTTINGEN","BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY","MADDEN-JULIAN OSCILLATION; NINO-SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; INDONESIAN FOREST-FIRES; EL-NINO; INDIAN-OCEAN; KELVIN WAVES; HAZE EPISODE; DIPOLE MODE; LAND-USE; PRECIPITATION",NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper argues that simultaneity is an important part of transnationalism that distinguishes it from long-distance nationalism. We therefore need to more extensively analyse how immigrants' transborder involvement in their home country simultaneously affects their participation in the host country. I suggest four ways in which the dynamic relationship between home- and host-country engagement can be conceived. The first is a zero-sum relationship, where increased engagement in one country leads to decreased involvement in the other. The second involves the side-by-side co-existence of sending-and receiving-country engagement without one directly influencing the other. The third is a positively reinforcing relationship, where increased engagement in one country leads to increased involvement in the other. The final option is a negatively reinforcing relationship.

We studied two kinds of antecedents: majority members' perceptions of Turkish minorities' acculturation behavior and their experiences of intergroup contact. The possible mediating role of outgroup affect was also investigated. 247 Flemish high school students completed a survey. Data were analyzed using path analyses. Results show that positive contact experiences and perceiving that Turkish immigrants make efforts to engage in contact with the host group and/or to adopt the host culture are associated with less negative affective reactions towards Turkish migrants. Perceiving that Turkish immigrants maintain their heritage culture is associated with more negative affective reactions. Our results further revealed that increased negative affective reactions are associated with less support for culture maintenance and for contact with the host group but with a higher demand for host culture adoption. The present results also show that expectations of contact engagement and expectations of host culture adoption cannot be considered as equivalent. This implies that results from studies using Berry's conceptualization of acculturation expectations (Berry, 2001) and results from studies using Bourhis' conceptualization of acculturation expectations (Bourhis, Moise, Perreault, & Senecal, 1997) are not directly comparable. Our data also clearly disconfirm the orthogonal structure of the fourfold acculturation model for majority members' acculturation expectations, suggesting that relying on the specific dimensions defining acculturation expectations may constitute a more valid approach to understand ongoing acculturation processes.

While the theory has been interpreted in many different ways, we emphasize its implications for the important role of social context: both processes and consequences of assimilation should depend on the local social context in which immigrants are embedded. We derive empirically falsifiable hypotheses about the interaction effects between social context and assimilation on immigrant children's well-being. We then test the hypotheses using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Our empirical analyses yield two main findings. First, for immigrant adolescents living in non-poverty neighborhoods, we find assimilation to be positively associated with educational achievement and psychological well-being but also positively associated with at-risk behavior. Second, there is little empirical evidence supporting our hypotheses derived from segmented assimilation theory. We interpret these results to mean that future research would be more fruitful focusing on differential processes of assimilation rather than differential consequences of assimilation.

The importance of the composition of those fat stores to flight performance is a field of recent interest. Here I review the evidence that dietary lipid fat composition affects exercise in birds. Seasonal changes in adipose composition and diet choice experiments have yet to provide strong evidence that fatty acid composition can affect flight performance. Direct manipulations of dietary fat, however, have been demonstrated to affect exercise performance in both avian and non-avian species. I also describe the major hypotheses for the mechanisms by which dietary fat affects exercise, focusing on the role of fatty acids as oxidative substrates and as structural components of membranes. Evidence is accumulating that fatty acids that are shorter or have more double bonds increase peak performance due to their higher transport rates en route to oxidation. Endurance and efficiency of flight may or may not be affected in similar ways. Other mechanisms requiring further investigation include membrane composition, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, and eicosanoid-mediated inflammation. Finally. I develop a theoretical framework for studying the composition of fat stores in migrants, focusing on the tradeoffs between fatty acid transport rates, energy storage, and assimilation during stopover refueling.

There is now a voluminous literature dealing with the emergence and above all the forms of transnational activities of migrants and the attendant consequences for the social integration of immigrants. If transnational ties and formations are consequential for social change and perhaps even social transformation, we also need to find indications about changing institutions in the national, international and local realms of transnational spaces. From this perspective we need not only to look at various transnational ties and formations across the borders of national states, but also at the repercussions for national and local institutions. In order to address this problem, the paper argues that both the concept of transnationalisationincluding transnational social spacesand world approaches, such as world systems and world polity theories, could be useful lenses to describe different aspects of transnational processes and boundaries.

Method: The factorial structure, reliability, and associations of the VDS factors with recognized socio-demographic correlates were examined using data collected from interviews with a non-probability community sample of 180 Vietnamese refugee adults in the Houston area. Results: The empirically derived factorial structure of the VDS approximated the theorized conceptualization of depression introduced by the scale's originators. Three factors (depressed affect, somatic symptoms, and cultural-specific symptoms) accounted for 65% of the variance. As hypothesized, the VDS factors correlated with age and acculturation variables.

Religiosity does not decline between the first and the second generation, nor does it become more symbolic in character. Furthermore, empirical evidence yields only limited support for the hypothesis that high levels of individual religiosity can only be found among structurally and socially less assimilated segments of the immigrant population. The same holds true for the argument that they just reflect generally high intergenerational value stability among immigrants.

Tests of the acculturation hypothesis have established that disparities in certain risks for low birth weight exist between subgroups of women of Mexican-origin. However, disparities observed by neighborhood of residence have yet to be explained. Most tests of the acculturation hypothesis assume a classical path of assimilation, whereby Mexican American health is expected to deteriorate with time spent residing in the U.S. and across the generations. The theory of segmented assimilation suggests that alternative paths are possible depending upon individual characteristics and the context of the neighborhood into which immigrant families and their children reside. This study tested the theory of segmented assimilation as a framework for examining the geographic, cultural, and socioeconomic underpinnings of population differences in infant low birth weight among women of Mexican descent in California using the 2000 U.S. Census and population-based data from the Maternal and Infant Health Assessment (1999-2005) (n = 6442). Little support was found for the theory's hypotheses. Rather, increased odds for infant low birth weight were observed for English speakers residing in Latino immigrant neighborhoods when compared to English speakers in other neighborhoods, an effect attenuated for Spanish speakers. Elevated odds of low birth weight were also observed among English speakers residing in Latino immigrant neighborhoods when compared to Spanish speakers in the same neighborhoods. Findings suggest the transfer of health-specific social capital in ethnic neighborhoods may depend upon sociocultural consonance between individuals and neighborhood residents. The authors call for additional research that sheds light on the sociocultural dynamics of maternal and infant health at multiple levels. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The author tests these ideas by examining variation in the generational pattern of achievement in low-income schools among Latino high school students.

Analysis of processes of development, maintenance and redefinition of identity in contexts of alternative cultural norms contends with the assumption of conscious choice or strategy towards mainstream and heritage cultures. From the perspective of identity issues, enculturation of cultural elements rather than acculturation is often the more significant process. Going beyond critique to consider issues of the persistence of ethnic identity and processes of cultural reformulation, brings attention to the origins of primordialist sentiment within ethnic identity and the possibilities for generating situationalist perspectives. Reference to empirical investigations using Identity Structure Analysis (introduced as a conceptual framework for explicating complex identity processes) provides evidence for different identity processes and structures according to socio-historical context and the greater malleability of situationalists compared with primordialists in their empathetic identifications with alternative cultural groups.

The current research, however, centers on the recipient nationals' attitudes toward immigrants and multiculturalism. Three distinctive frameworks to examine host nationals' perceptions are proposed based on (1) intergroup relations, (2) individual level differences, and (3) cultural level differences. Five studies were conducted in line with the three frameworks using attitudes toward immigrants as the common dependent measure. Based on the intergroup framework, Studies I and 2 examined the influence of intergroup contact, national pride, perceived permeability, fairness, intergroup threat, and host community acculturation strategies. Results showed that decreased contact and increased threat predicted less favorable perception toward immigrants (Study 1); respondents who espoused a need for immigrant assimilation and exclusionism, and those who espoused a less individualistic perception toward migration expressed more negative immigrant attitudes (Study 2). In the second framework on individual differences, the influence of personal enduring dispositions on immigrant attitudes was examined. The independent variables included social dominance orientation, self-esteem, individualism-collectivism, national pride, and Schwartz's personal values. Low self-esteem and individualism, and high social dominance predicted less favorable attitudes toward immigrants. Furthermore, high social dominance predicted less favorable perceptions but only among host nationals who also rated high on individualism (Study 3). Regarding personal values orientation, respondents who placed greater emphasis on security and achievement motivation expressed more negative attitudes, but endorsement of the stimulation value type predicted more favorable perceptions (Study 4). In the third and final framework, effects of cultural differences on immigrant attitudes were examined (Study 5). Secondary data from the Eurobarometer [Eurobarometer, 2000. Attitudes towards minority groups in the European Union: A special analysis of the Eurobarometer 2000 opinion poll on behalf of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia. Eurobarometer Opinion Poll. Retrieved September 1, 2003 from http://europa.eu.int/comm//public_opinion/index_en.htm] and Hofstede's cultural typologies were used. Masculinity was associated with reduced multicultural optimism and support for policies that promote social co-existence; uncertainty avoidance, collectivism, and power distance were related to weaker support for multicultural policies. Overall, two broad dimensions of acculturation experience emerged from the research, the first one is based on an 'invasion' perspective and the second one reflects an 'enrichment' experience.

It goes on to examine Hobfoll's (2001) Conservation of Resources stress theory, a model which has important implications for refugee research. Drawing upon the models reviewed, the last section outlines a conceptual framework for adaptation among refugees. At the heart of it lies the concept of resources. However, resources must be understood in terms of the individual's needs, personal goals and the demands he or she encounters. Each of these concepts must be examined in the context of the pre-migration, flight and post-migration phases. The additional concept of constraints on the use of or access to resources is particularly relevant to the post-migration phase.

Much of this work has questioned whether classical theories of immigrant adaptation, which assumed assimilation to be an integral part of the process of upward mobility for immigrants, are still applicable to today's immigrant children. This study reevaluates the applicability of classical assimilation theory with a comprehensive empirical assessment of the relationship between assimilation and the well-being of Hispanic and Asian immigrant adolescents. Using Add Health data, we examine the effect of different aspects of assimilation on educational achievement, psychological well-being, and at-risk behaviors. We find that the effect of assimilation varies greatly depending on the ethnic group and outcome under consideration, but that it is generally related to both greater academic achievement and more at-risk behavior. We conclude that assimilation theory is still relevant, but suggest an interpretation that emphasizes a process of decreasing differences between groups rather than either detrimental or beneficial effects of assimilation.

Results verified that both Chinese and western acculturation occurred on individual psychological levels and that the bidimensional model was a suitable acculturation framework. Using hierarchical multiple regression, results suggested that acculturation towards Chinese (majority) culture was related to better adaptation in terms of higher academic achievement and positive family dynamics (parental nurturance and closer family relationships). Acculturation towards western (minority) culture was related to poorer adaptation in terms of engaging in greater misconduct and negative family interactions (larger intergenerational value discrepancies and family conflicts). Thus, acculturation towards the majority culture held adaptive implications, whereas acculturation towards the minority culture held maladaptive implications.

We address this issue considering two cohorts of young people who left school in the last decade of the twentieth century. Our results show that, with educational qualifications kept constant, the penalty remains basically the same over the years for young people of North African origin -who were already experiencing difficulties in the 1980s- in spite of relatively favorable labor market conditions and regardless of the ongoing educational expansion. Two other groups were also subjected to a significant penalty: young people of sub-Saharan African origin and, to a lesser degree, young people of Southeast Asian origin. Over this period, while the improvement of economic conditions benefited most degree-holders, high numbers of young people of North African immigrant origin remained stuck in lower educational positions. The group was overtaken by young people of Portuguese origin, who seem to have gained access to higher educational levels through the extension of vocational education to the lower tertiary level. Such facts would seem to support the idea of statistical discrimination, a mechanism based on a given group's average characteristics. However, the boundary line between this and more overtly racist discrimination remains indistinct. In any case, the strong feeling of being discriminated against expressed by young people of North African and black African origins, as well as their pessimistic view of the future, reveals a sharp cleavage within French society -a statement that does not hold, however, for young people of Turkish origin. These pessimistic perceptions may also work to amplify a negative dynamic over the longer term, as shown by longitudinal data available on the second cohort.

Contribution to segmented assimilation theory",0,"not migrant","This article examines the strength over time of the ethnic penalty in hiring in France for two cohorts of young people who left school in the last decade of the twentieth century. The results show that for equal educational degrees, the penalty affecting the Maghrebin group, who were already in difficulty in the 1980s despite a temporary fall in unemployment and continued democratizing of the school system, did not change substantially. The penalty was also significant for two other groups : young people of sub-Saharan African origin and, to a lesser degree, young people of Southeast Asian origin. During this period the improving economic context was more favorable to degree-holding applicants than others, while children of Maghrebin immigrants were still numerically more likely to have low qualifications. Young people of Portuguese origin, who seem to have advanced upon expansion of vocational specialization programs into higher education, pulled ahead of the Maghrebin group and they are from now ahead. This may strengthen the hypothesis of << statistical discrimination >>, a mechanism based on a group's average characteristics. The borderline between statistical discrimination and more overtly racist discrimination remains unclear, however. The strong feeling of being discriminated against that is expressed by young people whose parents immigrated from North Africa or Black Africa, together with their pessimistic vision of the future, are indications of a serious split running through French society, though this does not affect the Turkish group.

Montgomery and Ervin Briones (see record 2006-03287-001). Schwartz et al. begin the process of developing a model with which to understand the acculturation of immigrants within the context of identity theory. To further the development of this model, in this commentary I will lay stress on the point that acculturation among immigrant people can be seen as a special form of the individualization of the life course. In their approach to acculturation among non-white, non-Western immigrants moving to Western nations, the authors argue that identity theory is essential in understanding the adjustments made as part of the acculturation process. The acculturation process is, in their view, an individual one, with each new member both adopting new beliefs and values from the receiving culture and retaining beliefs and values from the culture of origin. Although no empirical work has yet been undertaken extending the identity capital model to how immigrants specifically accrue and exchange identity capital resources, it does provide a theoretical starting point in an area that is without theoretical foundations, as noted by Schwartz, Montgomery and Briones in this issue, and alerts us to factors that can specifically advantage or disadvantage those with different backgrounds and personal characteristics.

"219","WebOfScience","Article",2005,"Wang, W","Ideological orientation and the PRC academic migration: A theoretical and longitudinal analysis",0,"not acculturation","Since the end of the Cold War era, Western capitalist countries have experienced increased immigration of highly trained professionals from former socialist Eastern European countries and from socialist countries such as China and Cuba. In studies of the determinants of international migration, the focus has repeatedly been on demographic, economic, social network, and political explanations. This study addresses the migration of highly trained professionals from the People's Republic of China (PRC) to the United States of America (USA). Logistic regression analyses of longitudinal data collected between mid-1988 and the beginning of 1992 show that, in addition to the explanatory power of the above predictors, transvaluation-the shift emphases from the socialist collectivist and interdependent ideological orientations to individualistic, independent, and competitive ideological orientations contribute to the migration decisions of the Chinese intellectuals. The results of field interviews and longitudinal comparisons suggest that the academics who come from an oppressed bourgeois-class origin, and who experience more independent and competitive lifestyles in China, are more likely to acquire individualistic and independent ideologies than those who come from privileged and working-class origins in China. The transvaluation is thus argued as a determinant of international migration, rather than as the post facto justfication or the assimilation effect that was argued in previous migration studies. The modest erosion of the socialist collectivist and interdependent orientations among Chinese academics in the 1988 to 1992 three-and-half-year time firame further enhanced their migration decisions. The longitudinal analyses suggest that the modifications of the individual ideological orientations among the Chinese academics may have occurred betbre the migration movement, rather than after. This finding thus challenges previous research regarding the determinants of international migration.",NA,NA,"SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY","Sociological Inquiry","0038-0245","1475-682X",NA,NA,75,"2",216,"248",33,NA,57,5,5,0,5,"WOS:000228121600004","10.1111/j.1475-682X.2005.00120.x",NA,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","IMMIGRATION",NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Logistic regression analysis looking at female headship is conducted using the 1960-1990 IPUMS. Additional analyses use the 1995 CPS to look at intergenerational patterns of female headship, divorce, and nonmarital fertility among Mexican-origin women relative to other groups of women. Results. Analysis using the IPUMS finds that U.S.-born Mexican-origin women have higher levels of female headship in every year compared to white women, and this difference has actually increased over time. Additionally, analysis using the 1995 CPS finds that while levels of female headship for second-generation Mexican-origin women are no higher, levels for third-generation Mexican-origin women far surpass those of white women. The high levels of female headship and the proportion of never married women with children in the household among third-generation Mexican-American women are startling and lend more support to a segmented assimilation framework.",0,"not theory","SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY","Social Science Quarterly","0038-4941","1540-6237",NA,NA,85,"1",89,"106",18,NA,40,19,19,0,7,"WOS:000188893300007","10.1111/j.0038-4941.2004.08501007.x",NA,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","UNITED-STATES; MEXICAN-AMERICANS; FAMILIES; ORIGIN; COHABITATION; IMMIGRATION; HISPANICS; FERTILITY; PATTERNS; MARRIAGE",NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Second , the effect of youths' immigration experience on the relationship among the protective factors was examined. Results showed partial support for the validity of the peer cluster model for this sample. As hypothesized, the peer domain variable Was significantly related to substance use, while the family domain variable served as a Protective factor against substance use. However, the school domain variable did not have any direct or indirect effects on substance use.

The former assumes that people move abroad permanently to maximize lifetime earnings whereas the latter assumes they leave temporarily to overcome market deficiencies at home. As a result, the two models yield very different conceptualizations of return migration. We draw upon each theoretical model to derive predictions about how different variables are likely to influence the probability of return migration. We use data from the German Socio-economic Panel to test specific hypotheses derived from each model. Finding some support for both perspectives, we suggest that migrants may be heterogeneous with respect to their migratory motivations. If so, then parameters associated with the determinants of return migration in any population of international migration will reflect a blending of parameters associated with two distinct economic rationales.

Design: A survey questionnaire was administered to a convenience sample of Chinese Americans and analyzed for descriptive statistics and relationships among variables. Subjects/Settings: Participants were 600 healthy individuals, ranging from 21 to 70 years of age, living in New York City. Variables Measured: Demographic factors, degree of acculturation, food preferences, and 13 social psychological scales derived from the Theory of Planned Behavior, the Healthy Belief Model, and Social Cognitive Theory. Dependent measures assessed were intention to reduce dietary fat and behaviors related to the selection of reduced-fat diets. Statistical Analyses: Descriptive statistics, Pearsons' correlation coefficients, t-tests, one-way analysis of variance, and multiple regression analyses were used. Results: Attitude, overall health concern, and self-efficacy accounted for 58% of the variance in behavioral intention for the entire sample. Attitude, perceived barriers, and self-efficacy accounted for 19% of the variance in the prediction of dietary fat reduction behaviors. In general, a gradient was seen in the increased predictiveness of cacti regression model by degree of acculturation of the immigrants to American culture: predictiveness (R2) for behavior ranged from 15% for the least to 34%, for the most acculturated. Acculturation was significantly related to declines in the influence of habit and of social norms. These effects were not seen by length of residency.

Drawing from a recent study of domestic violence among four generations of Japanese American women, this paper elucidates approaches to address methodological challenges in research with immigrant populations. Preliminary studies in both the respondents' country of origin and the United States assisted the identification of socio-culturally rooted manifestations of partners' violence; the development of an expanded, socio-culturally relevant measure of domestic violence; and the examination of within-group variations in the perception about and coping responses to partners' violence. Based on the findings of this and other studies of immigrants, this paper proposes the Immigrants-in-Context framework to conceptualize immigrants' experiences in the context of interactive and transgenerational influences of the socio-cultural factors in the country of origin and those in the country of immigration/residence.

Alejandro Portes and Min Zhou's theory offers a new perspective to the question: Under what conditions are youth susceptible to marijuana use and delinquent behavior? In contrast to Milton Gordon's classic one-path theory, segmented assimilation theory looks to the immigrant culture and social capital (e.g., social solidarity) as critical factors in the assimilation process. The theory suggests several different types of adaptation by immigrant youth and Asian youth born in the United States. The data from the Asian Student Drug Survey were used to analyze the patterns of marijuana use and delinquent behavior among Japanese, Chinese, Filipino, Korean, Southeast Asian, Asian Indian, and Pacific Islander youth, controlling for human capital and social capital, as well as other relevant factors. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors that affect the odds of marijuana use and delinquent behavior for the seven ethnic groups in this study. The likelihood of marijuana use differed significantly among the ethnic groups. For example, Pacific Islander and Filipino youth were much more likely than Japanese youth to use marijuana. Korean, Southeast Asian, and Asian Indian youth did not differ significantly from the Japanese youth in marijuana use. Like the model that predicted marijuana use, the Chinese youth were least likely to engage in delinquent behavior, while Filipino and Pacific Islander youth were most likely.

The distinctions between perspectives such as qualitative-quantitative, subjective-objective, functional-interpretive, etc., dominate theoretical and methodological writings. These distinctions ave important for outlining the parameters of various research programs, however, many interesting issues in the cultural adjustment process deny the dichotomization of experience and require an approach that addresses a reality that is both reliable and present while at the same lime situated and emergent. Recently our focus in the field has been trained on how we might bridge those distinct paradigms with a plausible intercultural theory. In the first portion of this article I outline three common research paradigms employed in intercultural relations. The social network perspective is then offered as a cross-paradigmatic research and theorizing approach. The conceptual history and relevant properties of social networks for intercultural research are described as part of the foundation for a theory of intercultural social networks that allows us to address the relational quality of intercultural interaction while acknowledging the stability of structural phenomena. I then propose seven assumptions and seven propositions comprising the beginning of a dynamic theory of intercultural social networks. Based upon the propositions put forward, future research avenues are suggested, I conclude that a socio-structural approach to acculturation, and the study of intercultural relations ill general, is uniquely suited to capture and reconcile situated, emergent phenomena with reliable, present phenomena and increase our understanding of inter-cultural relations.

A theoretical-empirical essay",1,NA,"This paper argues that expellees and refugees typically had different courses of integration into the society of postwar Germany. Census data in 1971 showed that expellees had been integrated with a high proportion experiencing downward social mobility upon their re-entry into the labour market but also attaining lower scores on educational achievement, whereas refugees were more often upwardly occupationally mobile and had higher scores on educational achievement. On a theoretical level, these two types of social integration epitomize one focusing on work, and one hinging on preservation of cultural identity as it relates to the country of origin. These two types fit into two classical models: Alfred Schutz's as contrasted with Georg Simmel's conceptions of the social role of the stranger.

Though a number of barriers toward professional treatment of this minority population have been considered, a significant barrier, namely the unique conceptualization of mental distress within this ethnic population and its divergence from mainstream American models of illness, has rarely been explored in depth. Further, though conceptual models and beliefs about depression in different ethnic groups have been addressed, the literature on conceptual models of anxiety is scarce. This investigation explored and compared conceptual models of anxiety and depression as well as treatment preferences in a largely immigrant, adult Chinese American sample and an adult European American sample in the United States. This study further explored the relationships between the cultural variables of individualism and collectivism, acculturation, and conceptual models of depression and anxiety. Results from this study did not support hypotheses that Chinese Americans would endorse more collectivistic values than European Americans, finding only that European Americans endorsed independent self-construal values to a greater degree than Chinese Americans. Conceptual models were found to differ between ethnic groups with European American participants endorsing biopsychiatic models of depression and anxiety significantly more than Chinese American participants, though both groups were found to demonstrate mixed models including biological, situational, and psychological causes for distress. Though European Americans were found to prefer psychotherapy as treatment more than Chinese Americans, medication and lay referral treatment preferences were not found to be different between groups in quantitative analyses. Qualitative analyses, however, revealed some of the stigma attitudes in Chinese Americans regarding professional mental health treatment. Results suggested that higher American acculturation significantly correlated with chemical biological causal models and psychological models of mental health distress. However, results did not support the hypothesis that cultural values such as individualism/collectivism or independent/interdependent self construal would be better predictors of conceputal model than ethnic group background. American acculturation also was not found to moderate the relationship between ethnicity and conceptual model of distress.

This critical review takes stock of the literature on exclusion of social relations. Social relations are defined as comprising social resources, social connections and social networks. An evidence review group undertook a critical review which integrates, interprets and synthesizes information across studies to develop a conceptual model of exclusion from social relations. The resulting model is a subjective interpretation of the literature and is intended to be the starting point for further evaluations. The conceptual model identifies individual risks for exclusion from social relations (personal attributes, biological and neurological risk, retirement, socio-economic status, exclusion from material resources and migration). It incorporates the evaluation of social relations, and the influence of psychosocial resources and socio-emotional processes, sociocultural, social-structural, environmental and policy contextual influences on exclusion from social relations. It includes distal outcomes of exclusion from social relations, that is, individual well-being, health and functioning, social opportunities and social cohesion. The dynamic relationships between elements of the model are also reported. We conclude that the model provides a subjective interpretation of the data and an excellent starting point for further phases of conceptual development and systematic evaluation(s).

Aim: The primary aim of the study is to empirically derive the factorial structure of the VDS to support its use as a culturally responsive depression screening tool in community samples of Vietnamese adults. Method: The factorial structure, reliability, and associations of the VDS factors with recognized socio-demographic correlates were examined using data collected from interviews with a non-probability community sample of 180 Vietnamese refugee adults in the Houston area. Results: The empirically derived factorial structure of the VDS approximated the theorized conceptualization of depression introduced by the scale’s originators. Three factors (depressed affect, somatic symptoms, and cultural-specific symptoms) accounted for 65% of the variance. As hypothesized, the VDS factors correlated with age and acculturation variables.

The current research, however, centers on the recipient nationals' attitudes toward immigrants and multiculturalism. Three distinctive frameworks to examine host nationals' perceptions are proposed based on (1) intergroup relations, (2) individual level differences, and (3) cultural level differences. Five studies were conducted in line with the three frameworks using attitudes toward immigrants as the common dependent measure. Based on the intergroup framework, Studies 1 and 2 examined the influence of intergroup contact, national pride, perceived permeability, fairness, intergroup threat, and host community acculturation strategies. Results showed that decreased contact and increased threat predicted less favorable perception toward immigrants (Study 1); respondents who espoused a need for immigrant assimilation and exclusionism, and those who espoused a less individualistic perception toward migration expressed more negative immigrant attitudes (Study 2). In the second framework on individual differences, the influence of personal enduring dispositions on immigrant attitudes was examined. The independent variables included social dominance orientation, self-esteem, individualism-collectivism, national pride, and Schwartz's personal values. Low self-esteem and individualism, and high social dominance predicted less favorable attitudes toward immigrants. Furthermore, high social dominance predicted less favorable perceptions but only among host nationals who also rated high on individualism (Study 3). Regarding personal values orientation, respondents who placed greater emphasis on security and achievement motivation expressed more negative attitudes, but endorsement of the stimulation value type predicted more favorable perceptions (Study 4). In the third and final framework, effects of cultural differences on immigrant attitudes were examined (Study 5). Secondary data from the Eurobarometer [Eurobarometer, 2000.

The current dissertation however, centers on recipient nationals' attitudes toward immigrants and perceptions of multiculturalism. Three distinctive frameworks to study host nationals' perceptions are adopted; they include: (1) intergroup relations, (2) individual differences, and (3) cultural differences. Five separate studies were done based on the three frameworks using attitudes toward Chinese immigrants as the dependent measure in all except the final study. Based on the intergroup framework, Study 1 and 2 examined the influence of intergroup contact, national pride, perceived permeability, fairness, threat and host community acculturation strategies. Results showed that decreased contact and increased threat predicted less favorable perception towards immigrants (Study 1); respondents who espoused a need for immigrant assimilation and exclusionism, and those who adopted a less individualistic perception towards migration tended to express a more negative attitude (Study 2). Based on an individual differences framework, Study 3 and 4 examined the influence of social dominance orientation, self-esteem, individualism-collectivism, national pride and personal values. Increased self-esteem and collectivism predicted more favorable attitudes toward immigrants, and increased social dominance orientation predicted less favourable perceptions among host nationals who rated high on individualism (Study 3); respondents who placed greater emphases on security and achievement motivation have expressed more negative attitudes, but endorsement of stimulation value predicted more favourable perceptions (Study 4). In the final study, cultural differences were adopted as correlates of attitudes. Secondary data from the Eurobarometer (2000) and Schwartz's and Hofstede's typologies of cultural differences were used. Based on Schwartz's model, increased mastery was associated with less multicultural optimism; increased egalitarian commitment was linked to lesser support for policies that promote co-existence; and increased harmony was related to less demand for cultural assimilation. Based on Hofstede's model, increased masculinity was associated with less multicultural optimism and lower demand for cultural assimilation; and increased uncertainty avoidance was related to decreased multicultural optimism.

Two directions for future acculturation research are proposed to follow this research paradigm shift: (1) to identify the positive adaptation outcomes in me process of acculturation; and (2) to identify significant protective factors and to investigate the protective mechanisms of how these factors work to promote positive adaptation outcomes in the context of acculturation.

Montgomery and Ervin Briones (see record [rid]2006-03287-001[/rid]). Schwartz et al. begin the process of developing a model with which to understand the acculturation of immigrants within the context of identity theory. To further the development of this model, in this commentary I will lay stress on the point that acculturation among immigrant people can be seen as a special form of the individualization of the life course. In their approach to acculturation among non-white, non-Western immigrants moving to Western nations, the authors argue that identity theory is essential in understanding the adjustments made as part of the acculturation process. The acculturation process is, in their view, an individual one, with each new member both adopting new beliefs and values from the receiving culture and retaining beliefs and values from the culture of origin. Although no empirical work has yet been undertaken extending the identity capital model to how immigrants specifically accrue and exchange identity capital resources, it does provide a theoretical starting point in an area that is without theoretical foundations, as noted by Schwartz, Montgomery and Briones in this issue, and alerts us to factors that can specifically advantage or disadvantage those with different backgrounds and personal characteristics.

We call this approach the Ecological Acculturation Framework (EAF). Results of a structural equation model (SEM) showed that job satisfaction fully mediated the relationship between American acculturation and psychological distress, demonstrating that this relationship was specific to an occupational domain.

It also provides a number of factors involved in the acculturative process and attainment of acculturative goals for the participants. Social, psychological, cultural, and environmental supports and barriers are presented that impact the acculturative process.

Existing programs tend to conflate issues related to immigrant status with ethnic or racial minorities. These programs also tend to ignore that acculturation and cultural discourse in health may vary depending on the immigrant subgroup and the host community’s social environment. This paper addresses the gap in the literature by proposing a conceptual framework that uses a socioecological perspective to outline acculturation and cultural factors in immigrants’ preventive health behaviours. To this end, we synthesized the literature on acculturation and cultural perspectives on preventive health among immigrants. We used a case study on influenza vaccination among Chinese immigrants to illustrate the importance of targeting and tailoring approaches to specific immigrant subgroups. We performed a critical examination of 10 existing influenza vaccination programs adapted for immigrants and ethnic minorities to outline their cultural sensitivity in surface- and deep- structure components. Finally, we proposed a conceptual framework integrating the acculturation factors, cultural elements, and cultural anatomy of the reviewed programs with application to Chinese immigrants as a demonstration of cultural sensitivity. The discussion includes limitations, recommendations, and future directions resulting from this framework to help inform cultural adaptation of preventive health programs for immigrants.

For example, studies have examined stressors surrounding the resettlement of Central Americans in Canada and workplace stress of women in the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong as well as the US. The phenomenon of flow of professional immigrants and the accompanying acculturative stresses is not limited to the US. In fact, there have been parallel incidents of acculturative stresses in countries such as France, the UK, Germany, Israel, and Russia. What we notice in each of these cases is that acculturation and acculturative stresses are primarily confined to the professional immigrant groups who migrate from collectivistic countries of Southeast and South Asia to G8 countries. Pottie et al. (2005) examined acculturation and acculturative stress of Central American male immigrants into Canada. There have also been several studies focusing on Russian immigrants to Israel in the 1980s; however, our research shows that there have been considerably more studies of acculturation and acculturative stresses of immigrants from developing nations into the US and Canada.

To ascertain how acculturation may influence Latino/a youth alcohol use, we integrated an expanded multi-domain model of acculturation with the Theory of Reasoned Action.

Youth completed measures of acculturation, attitudes toward drinking, perceived subjective norms regarding alcohol use, intention to drink, and alcohol use.Results. Structural equation modeling indicated that collectivistic values predicted more perceived disapproval of drinking, which negatively predicted intention to drink. Intention to drink predicted elevated alcohol use. Conclusion: Although the association between collectivistic values and social disapproval of drinking was relatively small (β = .19, p < .05), findings suggest that collectivistic values may help protect Latino/a immigrant youth from alcohol use by influencing their perceived social disapproval of drinking, leading to lower intention to drink.

The lack of focus on process integration has inhibited our understanding of precisely why and how adjustment processes unfold and ultimately cause (dys)functional change in criteria. In response, we review the motives and processes of cross-cultural adjustment and integrate these into a theoretical framework, examining the discrete episode of expatriate-host national interaction as the focal vehicle for change. First, we synthesize the general causal sequence within an interaction episode. We then summarize state inputs that condition processing. Next, we describe identity management and learning processing in depth. Then, we discuss key interactions among the motive and processing categories. Finally, we orient the cross-cultural interaction episode within the nomological network of cross-cultural adjustment predictors and criteria. This framework prescribes that an expatriate should initially reduce acculturative stress through repeated, functional identity management and learning processing of novelty encountered in cross-cultural interaction episodes. To do so, one must avoid inhibitory input states and the many potential processing failures identified here. If the expatriate experiences enough such functional interaction episodes, a 'Stage 2' is reached where the motive to reduce stress has been largely overcome, and thereafter, interaction episode processing proceeds more functionally in general.

In this context, cross-cultural dimensions of psychological disorders receive increased attention, especially depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorders among the migrant population. In this paper we propose a theoretical framework for the understanding of migrant mental health. This framework combines elements from Berry's acculturation model and Antonovsky's salutogenic theory. The former illustrates the main factors that affect an individual's adaptation in a new cultural context. The term acculturative stress denotes unresolved problems resulting from intercultural contact that cannot be overcome easily by simply adjusting or assimilating. The latter specifies the relationship between culturally associated stress and mental health more distinctive, introducing the concepts of generalized resistance resources and sense of coherence that determine mental health outcomes of migrants during acculturative stress periods. Specifically, we provide an integrative framework of acculturation and salutogenesis that helps to integrate inconsistent findings in the migrant mental health literature. The current paper focuses on the effect of resource factors for positive mental health outcomes in the migrant population and summarises some implications for future research activities.

Drawing upon a case study of a family originating in Calabria, Italy, and living in Adelaide, South Australia, I consider the way in which the three generations perceive their ‘being ethnic’ across time and space. The first-generation participants were born in Italy and migrated to Australia during the 1950s; the second generation are their children; and the third generation are the children of the second generation. The findings show a widespread intergenerational identification of ethnicity as ‘being Italian’, which, however, has different meanings across the three generations. This depends on the participants’ phenomenological perceptions of being thrown into the world [Heidegger, M. (1962). Being and time. (J. Macquarie & E. Robinson, Trans.). New York, NY: Harper]. Some 40 years after Huber’s [(1977). From pasta to Pavlova: A comparative study of Italian settlers in Sydney and Griffith. St Lucia: University of Queensland Press] study about the assimilation of Italian-Australians published in her book From Pasta to Pavlova, the present paper shows a movement from pavlova to pasta, especially by the third-generation participants, who experience a sense of ethnic revival. Essential in such a shift of ethnic identity is what I refer to as institutional positionality; that is, one’s perceptions of the position of one’s ‘ethnic being in the world’. This is investigated by combining with the sociology of migration, including the Bourdieusian conceptual apparatus of capital [Bourdieu, P. (1986). The forms of capital. In J. Richardson (Ed.), Handbook of theory and research in the sociology of education (pp. 241–258). New York, NY: Greenwood Press], a Heideggerian existential theory [Heidegger, 1962].

Conflict, or the discrepancy between NV and FM, was assessed to predict psychological distress, the outcome variable in this study, among South Asian parents. The goal was to establish the generalizability of SLT as well as empirically establish areas of conflict around which psychological intervention might be beneficial. Two hundred and six volunteer South Asian subjects completed the questionnaires utilized in this study. Two samples, each consisting of 103 subjects were created with the constraint that equal numbers of males and females and equal numbers of the three main South Asian religious groups (Muslim, Hindu, and Sikh) were included in each sample. This was done to maintain independence of data due to the fact that the majority of the subject pool consisted of both members of a marital dyad. It was hypothesized that there would be a positive correlation between level of conflict (defined as magnitude of positive discrepancy when FM is subtracted from NV) and level of psychological distress as measured by the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). Empirical questions were also formulated based on variables including acculturation, ethnic identity, marital satisfaction, life stress, SLT variables, and demographics. A final empirical question, concerned with whether any of the 10 SCL-90-R subscales would be better predicted by the SLT variables, was also constructed. Overall, the main hypothesis concerning the predicted positive relationship between conflict (NV minus FM) and SCL-90-R scores was not confirmed. The two samples provided weak and somewhat mixed results. Data from Sample 1 did yield limited support for the correlation between conflict and psychological distress.

This study explored risk and protective factors that influence high-risk behaviors in Hispanic adolescents. A theoretical model was developed based on an integration of Ecodevelopmental Theory and the Theory of Reasoned Action to investigate individual and social factors that affect the risk behaviors of Hispanic adolescents. This study was a cross-sectional, descriptive, secondary investigation of the baseline data of a combined sample of 493 Hispanic adolescent 7th and 8th graders and their immigrant parents who had been recruited for participation in the Familias Efficacy I and II studies. The hypothesized model of relationships included 3 direct effects variables: parent-adolescent communication about sex; adolescent condom use self-efficacy; and family functioning, which integrated 4 constructs: parental involvement; positive parenting; family communication; and parent-adolescent communication. The study model also included 3 indirect variables: parents’ acculturation; differential acculturation; and parent’s HIV knowledge. Three adolescent risk behaviors served as outcome variables: condom use; drinking alcohol while having sex; and substance use. It was hypothesized that (1) family functioning, parent-adolescent communication about sex, and adolescent self efficacy would all be directly related to adolescent risk behaviors; (2) parent’s acculturation would be related to adolescent risk behaviors indirectly through its association with parent’s HIV knowledge and parent-adolescent communication about sex; and (3) differential acculturation would be related to adolescent risk behaviors indirectly through its association with family functioning, adolescent condom use self-efficacy, and parent-adolescent communication about sex. Cronbach’s α computed for all measures yielded good to excellent reliability coefficients. Pearson linear correlation coefficients were calculated between all of the study variables, followed by confirmatory factor analysis to ascertain the feasibility of collapsing multiple indicators of family functioning and HIV/STIs risk behaviors into single latent variables. Finally, the hypothesized structural equation model was estimated. Beta coefficients were calculated to examine direct effects and Mackinnon’s asymmetric distribution of product test was used to evaluate mediated effects. Data analysis failed to confirm any of the study hypotheses; however, post-hoc analyses yielded findings that merit further study. Family functioning emerged as the heart of the model, embedded within a web of direct and mediated relationships. Additional findings suggest that family functioning mediates the effect of parents’ acculturation and of parents’ HIV knowledge on adolescent risk behaviors. Study limitations include its cross-sectional design, self-report measures, convenience sample and integration of clinical and non-clinical samples. Suggestions are provided for researchers to further explore relationships among the variables, and recommendations made for community nursing practitioners to develop, implement and evaluate HIV/STIs prevention programs for Hispanic adolescents.

The purpose of this descriptive cross-sectional study was to identify factors associated with disparities in self-rated health (SRH) among Asian and Hispanic immigrants. The acculturation theory and intersectionality framework were used to select predictors of SRH that included age, gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status, depressive symptoms, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, acculturation status, social position, and acculturative stress and discrimination events. A systematic review of the literature was completed and data from the 2009-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the 2002-2003 National Latino and Asian American Study were reviewed. This study found that acculturation status was associated with reporting disparities in SRH for both Asian and Hispanic immigrants. Limited English proficiency and being foreign-born was associated with worse SRH for Korean, Chinese, and Mexican immigrants, and in aggregate samples of Asian and Hispanic immigrants, compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Additionally, limited English proficiency was associated with worse SRH for Vietnamese immigrants. Among Mexican immigrants, higher levels of acculturation were associated with better SRH. Other key findings among Mexican immigrants were that depressive symptoms, increasing age, female gender, and elevated CRP were predictors of worse SRH compared to U.S.-born, non-Hispanic Whites. However, female gender and higher CRP were not predictors of worse SRH when level of acculturation was controlled for. For Chinese immigrants, acculturative stress was associated with worse SRH in an additive model while the interactions between social position and discrimination, and between gender, acculturative stress, and social position and education were predictive of worse SRH in multiplicative models. In summary, age, gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status, depressive symptoms, CRP, acculturation status, social position, and acculturative stress and discrimination were associated with disparities in SRH among two ethnic minorities in the U.S. These findings can be used to improve awareness and understanding of these immigrant populations who are vulnerable to poor health outcomes. Additionally, outcomes can assist in developing interventions to reduce the influence of social structures on health and to capture the true complexities of immigrants' lives.

This research examines the distributions of acculturation attitudes based on his original cultural maintenance–cultural contact conceptualization and on a later cultural maintenance–cultural adoption model. In line with the Relative Extended Acculturation Model it also compares the outcomes of real (self-reported behavioral) and ideal (attitudinal) assessments of acculturation. Two hundred and eighty-nine first generation immigrants in New Zealand participated in the study. In line with the hypotheses, integration occurred more frequently when derived from cultural contact than from cultural adoption and when acculturation was framed in attitudinal, rather than behavioral, terms.

The two groups of Haitian immigrant mothers were recruited from cities throughout the Northeast region of the United States. Using Harkness and Super's Developmental Niche as a theoretical guide, the researcher developed a qualitative interview protocol to assess the three components of this study's conceptualization of racial and ethnic socialization: (a) Haitian immigrant mothers' racial and ethnic messages and practices; (b) role the place in which the mothers were born and raised plays in their racial and ethnic socialization messages and practices; and (c) the factors that influence the mothers' racial and ethnic socialization messages and practices. Constructive grounded theory procedures were used to find themes and patterns of racial and ethnic socialization within the two groups of Haitian immigrant mothers and to identify similarities and differences among the two groups. The results from this study reveal that racial and ethnic socialization are processes of child development that are intricately related to the culture in which the family lives. Haitian immigrant mothers in Group A had similar racial socialization messages and practices to the Haitian immigrant mothers in Group B; however, the two groups differed greatly in their ethnic socialization messages and practices. Their messages and practices were influenced by the lessons they learned from their parents and the experiences that they had with race and ethnicity in Haiti and in the United States. In addition, being born and raised in Haiti and in the United States dictated the social contexts that Haitian immigrant mothers in Group A and Group B were exposed to, which shaped their understanding of and beliefs about race and ethnicity, their racial and ethnic identity, and the racial and ethnic identity they prescribed to their children.

In particular, I explore whether fluent bilingualism—proficiency in both minority home language and English—provides an adaptation advantage to the children of the post-1960 immigrants in terms of educational aspirations, expectations, college enrollment and graduation, compared to their English- monolingual or limited-bilingual peers. The results indicate that high school seniors from homes in which a second language is spoken prefer English over the parental language and that a shift to the dominant use of English by the third generation appears to be occurring. However, a quarter of those seniors maintain some proficiency in the minority home language. Proficiency rates vary by minority language group, but one in four youths from dual-language homes is fluently bilingual. Length of residence in the United States, measured as generational status, largely determines proficiency in minority home language, English and fluent bilingualism. Family social background and family structure are only weakly associated with language proficiency. However, family social background is a strong predictor of educational aspirations and attainment. Korean- and Vietnamese-speaking seniors not only report higher educational ambitions but also enroll in and graduate from a four-year college at higher rates than Spanish, Khmer- and Russian- speaking seniors. Spanish speakers appear to the most disadvantaged in terms of graduating from college Fluently bilingual youths hold higher educational aspirations and expectations than their English monolingual peers when family social background, family structure and generational status are controlled and are also more likely to attend a four-year college. However, fluent bilingualism does not provide an advantage in graduating from a four-year college.

Using a nation wide survey of 445 Chinese immigrants in November 2017, this study investigates the effects of cognitive barriers (i.e., acculturation levels) and affective obstacles (i.e., mental illness stigma) on Chinese immigrants' perceptual, attitudinal, and behavioral responses toward mental health services, by combing situational theory of problem solving and the theory of planned behavior. This study also examines the effects of mainstream and ethnic media use on acculturation and perceived stigma. Findings provide empirical support for the combined model, showing that all the cognitive and affective factors can predict Chinese immigrants' communicative action and behaviors regarding mental health services utilization. In addition, this study found that acculturation (cognitive barriers) is an effective predictor of individuals' ability to recognize the problem, connection to the problem, subjective norms regarding the problem, and their perceived behavioral control over the problem. On the other hand, mental illness stigma (affective barriers) can predict individuals' constraint recognition, attitudes, and perceived behavioral control over the issue. Practical implications are discussed for health public relations practitioners and communicators to better identify publics, propose strategic messages, and implement communication campaigns to improve Chinese immigrants' mental health services utilization rates.

This conceptual framework addresses the potential of groups with multiple social backgrounds to play a role in the facilitation of positive intergroup relations between their distinct social counterparts (e.g., immigrants as a gateway between home and host countries). Given their shared identity with different social groups, people with multiple identities can potentially bridge the cleft between the two otherwise separate groups with which they are affiliated. In this article, we first provide a theoretical introduction to the gateway group notion and review preliminary experimental and social network‐based research on gateway groups' potential to improve intergroup relations. We then integrate this novel concept with the existing literature on intergroup contact and social categorization and discuss the potential social implications of gateway groups.

We studied two kinds of antecedents: majority members’ perceptions of Turkish minorities’ acculturation behavior and their experiences of intergroup contact. The possible mediating role of outgroup affect was also investigated. 247 Flemish high school students completed a survey. Data were analyzed using path analyses. Results show that positive contact experiences and perceiving that Turkish immigrants make efforts to engage in contact with the host group and/or to adopt the host culture are associated with less negative affective reactions towards Turkish migrants. Perceiving that Turkish immigrants maintain their heritage culture is associated with more negative affective reactions. Our results further revealed that increased negative affective reactions are associated with less support for culture maintenance and for contact with the host group but with a higher demand for host culture adoption. The present results also show that expectations of contact engagement and expectations of host culture adoption cannot be considered as equivalent. This implies that results from studies using Berry's conceptualization of acculturation expectations (Berry, 2001) and results from studies using Bourhis’ conceptualization of acculturation expectations (Bourhis, Moïse, Perreault, & Senécal, 1997) are not directly comparable. Our data also clearly disconfirm the orthogonal structure of the fourfold acculturation model for majority members’ acculturation expectations, suggesting that relying on the specific dimensions defining acculturation expectations may constitute a more valid approach to understand ongoing acculturation processes.

This may be due, in large part, to the lack of theory in commonly used methods to match programmatic content and delivery to the culture of a population, particularly at the deep structural level. This paper asserts that prior to the cultural adaptation of prevention programs, it is necessary to first develop a conceptual framework. We propose a multiphase approach to address key challenges in the science of cultural adaptation by first identifying and exploring relevant cultural factors that may affect the targeted health-related behavior prior to proceeding through steps of a stage model. The first phase involves developing an underlying conceptual framework that integrates cultural factors to ground this process. The second phase employs the different steps of a stage model. For Phase I of our approach, we offer four key steps and use our research study as an example of how these steps were applied to build a framework for the cultural adaptation of a family-based intervention to prevent adolescent alcohol use, Guiding Good Choices (GGC), to Chinese American families. We then provide a summary of the preliminary evidence from a few key relationships that were tested among our sample with the greater purpose of discussing how these findings might be used to culturally adapt GGC.

The three featured articles in the December 2010 section on cultural diversity across the Pacific address important cultural issues in psychology. Berry (2010) applied these issues to intercultural relations and acculturation, Furnham (2010) to culture shock, and Marsella and Yamada (2010) to psychopathology. The common theme among these articles was the Western-centric dominance of psychology’s research, theories, models and practice, in part because of structural discrimination such as ethnocentric curricula, policies and teaching methods within academic institutions. In Aotearoa New Zealand, including mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge) and kaupapa Māori (Māori philosophy) within curricula for clinical psychology has started to address that Western-centric dominance, but more importantly, resulted in more culturally safe and responsive psychological services being provided to Māori users of those services. The present commentary suggested that including and integrating more cross-cultural and indigenous knowledge into the tertiary curricula of applied psychology fields, such as clinical, industrial-organisational, and coaching psychology would be one way to counter the Western-centric dominance.

The three articles in this special edition of the Journal of Pacific Rim Psychology encompass a range of approaches within cross-cultural psychology. Adrian Furnham’s (2011) culture shock shows how academic psychology can be applied to, and helps to inform a popular concept. John Berry’s (2011) acculturation theory demonstrates how focused theory and empirical data can align with a national agenda. Anthony J.

The theory presented in this book is grounded in a systems perspective, based on which a set of assumptions, axioms, theorems, and a model are explicated. It emphasizes the stress-adapatation-growth dynamics of cross-cultural experiences, which bring about cultural strangers' gradual transformation toward increased functional fitness in the host milieu. Effective intrapersonal (cognitive, affective, and behavioural) and social (interpersonal and mass) communication activities are theorized as being at the heart of successful adaptation—along with individual background characteristics and host environmental conditions.

The present research proposed a construct termed global orientation to denote individual differences in the psychological processes of acculturating to the globalizing world. It encompasses multicultural acquisition as a proactive response and ethnic protection as a defensive response to globalization. Ten studies examined the applicability of global orientations among majority and minority groups, including immigrants and sojourners, in multicultural and relatively monocultural contexts, and across Eastern and Western cultures. Multicultural acquisition is positively correlated with both independent and interdependent self-construals, bilingual proficiency and usage, and dual cultural identifications. Multicultural acquisition is promotion-focused, while ethnic protection is prevention-focused and related to acculturative stress. Global orientations affect individuating and modest behavior over and above multicultural ideology, predict overlap with outgroups over and above political orientation, and predict psychological adaptation, sociocultural competence, tolerance, and attitudes toward ethnocultural groups over and above acculturation expectations/strategies. Global orientations also predict English and Chinese oral presentation performance in multilevel analyses and the frequency and pleasantness of intercultural contact in cross-lagged panel models. We discuss how the psychological study of global orientations contributes to theory and research on acculturation, cultural identity, and intergroup relations.

To fill this gap, the present research examines how key acculturation variables (e.g., strength of ethnic/host cultural identifications, bicultural identity integration or BII) relate to the composition and structure of bicultural individuals’ personal social networks. In Study 1, we relied on a generationally and culturally diverse community sample of 123 Latinos residing in the US. Participants nominated eight individuals (i.e., alters) from their habitual social networks and across two relational domains: friendships and colleagues. Results indicated that the interconnection of same ethnicity alters across different relationship domains is linked to cultural identifications, while the amount of coethnic and host individuals in the network is not. In particular, higher interconnection between Latino friends and colleagues was linked to lower levels of U.S. identification. Conversely, the interconnection of non-Latino friends and colleagues was associated with lower levels of Latino identification. This pattern of results suggests that the relational context for each type of cultural identification works in a subtractive and inverse manner. Further, time spent in the US was linked to both Latino and U.S. cultural identifications, but this relationship was moderated by the level of BII. Specifically, the association between time in the US and strength of both cultural identities was stronger for individuals reporting low levels of BII. Taking the findings from Study 1 as departure point, Study 2 used an agent-based model data simulation approach to explore the dynamic ways in which the content and the structure of an immigrant’s social network might matter over time in predicting three possible identity patterns: coexisting cultural identifications, conflicting cultural identifications, and a mixture of the two. These simulations allowed us to detect network constellations, which lead to identification or disidentification with both cultures. We showed that distinct patterns of social relations do not lead to identity outcomes in a deterministic fashion, but that often many different outcomes are probable.

Many intercultural communication studies deliberately place ethnic identity at the core of identity research to avoid using racial identity. Influenced by the difference-as-problem viewpoint, sojourners’ and immigrants’ Other-identities are often viewed as abnormal, deviant, and alien and therefore should be managed, reduced, and even eliminated. However, critical scholarship has revealed that the sense of being the Other is the main theme of sojourners and immigrants. Drawing upon postmodern, postcolonial, and hermeneutic approaches, sojourners’ and immigrants’ 3 types of Other-identities are conceptualized in this review, and their embeddedness in asymmetric power structures is explained. These ideas emerge from social categorization processes that use both phenotypic and cultural markers as primary categorizing criteria. Consequently, the view held by biculturalists is refuted, and elaboration is presented about the ways migrating individuals—in intercultural encounters—enrich their sense of Self through integrating their Other-identities into their Self-identities, producing fused identities.

These challenges, such as language barriers, racial discrimination, underemployment, the loss of support networks, and changes in family role and structure, may exacerbate myriad mental health issues. In addition, their help-seeking behavior, as shaped by a general adherence to a collectivistic woridview and indirect communication style, often creates challenges for the practitioners who arc trained under a Western practice modality. Drawing on literature from English-speaking countries with sizable Asian immigrant populations such as the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United Kingdom, this text is designed especially for clinicians and students working with Asian immigrant populations. It discusses the therapeutic process in psychotherapy and counseling with these clients, exploring both key psychodynamic constructs and social systemic factors. Building on contemporary relational theory, which emphasizes the centrality of the helping relationship and sensitivity to the client's subjective realities, the book demonstrates how Western-based concepts and skills can be broadened and applied in an Asiacentric context, and can be therapeutic even in social service and case management service settings. There are chapters on issues such as domestic violence, intergenerational conflicts, depression amongst elders, and suicide, discussing the prevalence and nature of the mental health issues and each containing case vignettes from various Asian ethnic groups to illustrate the application of relational approaches.

They show how evolutionary stability may change because of differences in initial conditions, whereas previous work on cultural evolution has focused only on how a particular culture might spread. The authors use the cultural assimilation of immigrants as the narrative for exposition. Specifically they look at the interaction between immigrants with an independent self-construct and immigrants with an interdependent self-construct in 2 settings—in a society that is predominantly collectivistic and in a society that is predominantly individualistic. Immigrants, whether with an independent self-construct or with an interdependent self-construct, can also be entity theorists (i.e., fixed mindset) or incremental theorists (i.e., growth mindset) about the self in relation to others. The authors use evolutionary game theory to model how the host country cultural environment places selective pressure on the cultures of immigrant populations, which, in turn, influences how well immigrants assimilate into their host country. Their results lead to 5 testable hypotheses: (a) depending on the initial ratio of immigrants with an independent self-construct and immigrants with an interdependent self-construct, assimilation is either complete or nonexistent in collectivistic societies; (b) in individualistic societies assimilation is never complete; (c) the lower the cost of coordination for immigrants with an interdependent self-construct, the easier it becomes for both immigrants with an independent self-construct and immigrants with an interdependent self-construct to assimilate into collectivistic societies; (d) the lower the cost of coordination for immigrants with an interdependent self-construct, the harder it becomes for both immigrants with an independent self-construct and immigrants with an interdependent self-construct to assimilate into individualistic societies; and (e) entity theorists are more likely to have an assimilation advantage in individualistic societies. In sum, our modeling approach offers a new framework for the understanding of the dynamic link between psychology and cultural evolution.

Early theorists described values as the cultural heritage, passed from one generation to the next, that allows individuals to function efficiently in their social environment and to preserve the structure of society (Mannheim, 1952; Mead, 1934). Cross-cultural studies of intergenerational value transmission are few in number, however. This chapter addresses some of the core issues relevant to the study of value transmission across cultures. We focus on the interplay of culture, migration, and parenting style as they relate to socialization processes. We first propose two different processes through which parenting style and culture may affect value socialization. We then consider the role of parenting style in diverse cultures, focusing on Russian-immigrant and veteran-Israeli youth. Then we examine acculturation attitudes and acculturation contexts as they relate to value socialization in immigrant families. Finally, we briefly discuss implications of the findings for cross-cultural studies of value socialization. This chapter asked how culture and migration affect cultural transmission. Two studies investigated this question, using Russian immigrants in Israel as an exemplary cultural group. This is one of the first attempts to study value transmission with a focus on cross-cultural issues. The data on love withdrawal and its relationship with controlled versus autonomous acceptance of perceived parental values supported the view that culture--through its expression in such cultural practices as parenting styles--affects the transmission process. The studies also demonstrated the role of adolescents' acculturation attitudes and of the acculturation context provided by the school in cultural transmission. Both studies further illustrated the importance of the appropriateness of parenting practices to particular cultures and contexts as an influence on cultural transmission. Cross-cultural studies provide a unique opportunity to study cultural transmission from a comparative perspective. The findings of these studies present a complex picture in which the influence of parents on their children depends on parents' own characteristics, on the characteristics of the children, and on cultural and situational factors. We have also identified additional sources of complexity that make the cross-cultural study of cultural transmission especially challenging. There is much yet to do to unravel the influences of parental values, parenting behavior, family relationships, and cultural context in the process of cultural transmission.

This article contributes a quantitative assessment of cannabis normalization as differentiated by social location predictors. Methods: Logistic and zero-inflated negative binomial regression models assess three areas of cannabis normalization: accessibility, acceptability, and recent use. Peer network cannabis use prevalence, gender, nativity, campus locale and living arrangement are explored as focal predictors of variation in normalization among 1,713 cannabis using and nonusing undergraduate students in Canada. Results: Women report lower odds of positive cannabis acceptability attitudes. While women report lower rates of recent cannabis use, gender is not a significant predictor for lifetime prevalence. Being a recent immigrant significantly predicts lower recent use, lower odds of favorable attitudes to cannabis, and reduced accessibility in comparison to students born in Canada. Longer-term immigrants do not show significant differences from students born in Canada on accessibility and acceptability, suggesting a substance use acculturation effect. Lower peer cannabis use prevalence exhibits a protective effect against use. In comparison to students who report that 'some' of their peer network uses cannabis, those with 'all' users in their network exhibit lower acceptability attitudes. This suggests a threshold relationship between peer use prevalence and acceptability. Conclusions/Importance: This article provides a data point for assessing future shifts in cannabis normalization prior to impending changes in Canadian drug policy that will legalize recreational cannabis use.

Most interpretations of these health patterns by duration of U.S. residence rely on theories of immigrant integration; they posit that with increasing time in the United States, immigrants incorporate economically, socially, and culturally into aspects of U.S. society, and that these changes impact health. Few studies empirically examine whether these aspects of integration are indeed mediators of the association between duration of U.S. stay and BMI, and if their patterns differ across immigrant subgroups. This study examines data from the National Latino and Asian American Survey, using path analytic methods to simultaneously test six hypothesized mediators between duration and BMI: household income, English language ability, ethnic identity, family cohesion, acculturative stress and discrimination for both Latino and Asian immigrants, stratified by gender. We find little evidence for an association between duration and BMI for either Latino or Asian men. For women, duration and BMI have a significant and positive relationship, although the pathways differ between the two ethnic groups. For Latina women, household income and acculturative stress are significant indirect pathways, although they work in opposing directions. For Asian women, English proficiency and discrimination are significant indirect pathways. Our findings reveal complex pathways between duration and BMI that vary by ethnicity and gender and highlight limitations in the negative acculturation theory, which suggests that exposure to the United States should have a net negative impact on health. In contrast, our findings suggest that not all groups show declining health with longer duration, as measured by BMI, and that integration processes do not always translate into health differences in the expected directions. Future research on duration patterns may need to consider alternative explanations beyond incorporation-based processes, such as cross-national health theories or age, period, cohort effects.

The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between the acculturation, ethnic socialization practices, and transnationalism of Mexican immigrant mothers (N = 60) living in Chicago. Using hierarchical linear regression analysis, different dimensions of acculturation and transnationalism were tested as predictors of ethnic socialization practices (i.e., cultural socialization, preparation for bias, use of cultural resources), controlling for demographic variables. The construct of transnationalism was composed of two dimensions: transnational network and transnational practices, and conceptualized as the degree of orientation or connectedness to family, friends, or community in immigrants’ nation of origin. In addition to testing transnational network and practices as predictors of ethnic socialization, they were also tested as moderators of the relationship between the dimensions of acculturation and dimensions of ethnic socialization. Results indicated that Mexican and American acculturation dimensions significantly predicted preparation for bias. Also, a larger transnational network and more transnational practices predicted more preparation for bias and use of cultural resources. Both transnational dimensions also moderated the relationship between Mexican and American acculturation dimensions with preparation for bias and use of cultural resources.

Mothers and youth had significant perceptual gaps in parenting practices, especially in autonomy support and parental commitment to education. Therefore, path analyses were conducted separately for mother-reported versus youth-reported parenting.

Phenomenological interviews with voluntary migrants, individuals who choose to leave their homeland to become foreigners in a new culture, reveal consistently deep themes and motivations which could convincingly be labelled 'existential'. Rather than migrating in search of employment, career advancement, or overall improved economic conditions, these voluntary migrants are seeking greater possibilities for self-actualising, exploring foreign cultures in order to assess their own identity, and ultimately grappling with issues of home and belonging in the world generally. The article offers a sketch of this phenomenon with reference to Martin Heidegger's ontology, thereby indicating alternative understandings of 'home', 'not-being-at-home', 'belonging', which take into account the narratives of these migratory experiences. An example of the conceptual ramifications of this new understanding of voluntary migration is found in the definition of 'home as interaction' rather than the usual 'home as place'. The article offers a cautionary note regarding the potentially profound and mostly ignored psychological consequences of the contemporary push to increasing globalisation.

The sample included 138 girls (M = 13.8 years) and their parents from Hong Kong, a former British colony. Results verified that both Chinese and western acculturation occurred on individual psychological levels and that the bidimensional model was a suitable acculturation framework. Using hierarchical multiple regression, results suggested that acculturation towards Chinese (majority) culture was related to better adaptation in terms of higher academic achievement and positive family dynamics (parental nurturance and closer family relationships). Acculturation towards western (minority) culture was related to poorer adaptation in terms of engaging in greater misconduct and negative family interactions (larger intergenerational value discrepancies and family conflicts). Thus, acculturation towards the majority culture held adaptive implications, whereas acculturation towards the minority culture held maladaptive implications. Consideration of the bicultural composition (e.g., status, prestige, strength of cultural networks of each culture) should be incorporated into acculturation theory to better understand adjustment implications across a wide range of contexts.

Eight migrants participated in up to five sessions including narrative and in-depth interviews, Occupational Mapping, and participation in occupations. Findings highlight that integration involves a process of 'starting over,' which entails becoming aware of differences in fields and habitus within and between home and host societies, learning 'how things work' in the host community, and negotiating performances in social interactions. This negotiation, enacted primarily through occupation, is influenced by differential access to forms of capital. It is further related to ways immigrants' intersecting identity markers are constructed within particular places and embedded in broader social systems and structures.

Method: Using a large, national‐level sample of Latino native‐born and immigrant youth, analyses are conducted using both ordinary least squares (OLS) and logistic regression. Results: Findings support hypotheses, showing that increases in cultural retention are associated with less coercion and more social support, both of which are, in turn, related to delinquency. Importantly, an initial strong inverse relationship between cultural retention and delinquency disappears when coercion and social support are controlled.

Because the social world is constituted by the broader cultural milieu in which an individual and groups of individuals reside, silencing the self theory can be a powerful tool in examining the interface between self and culture. The theory can further be used to explore the process of transitioning from one culture to another, a process embodied in the immigrant experience. In this chapter, I describe the role of self-silencing in a particular type of immigrant experience: that of women who have emigrated from the English-speaking Caribbean to Canada or the United States. The basis for this discussion is a series of focus groups that were conducted in Toronto and New York City in which Caribbean immigrant women talked about the idea of self-silencing within the context of their lives as immigrant women. Through a comparison of the focus group findings from the Canadian immigrant sample and the American immigrant sample, it is possible to detect phenomenological differences in the role that self-silencing plays in adapting to the cultural context in the United States in contrast to the cultural adaptation described by the immigrant women in Canada. I contend that these differences, which I outline in this chapter, emerge from differing meanings and constructions around race, identity, and selfhood between these two host countries.

High income countries show an elevated rate of physical inactivity among children. Low- and middle-income countries are beginning to experience a gradual increase in this trend. Canada is a highly industrialized multicultural society with nearly 22% of foreign-born individuals coming through the immigration process. Recent immigrants tend to experience a decline in their health status, over time as their years in Canada increase (negative acculturation effect). This phenomenon can be attributed to several factors including adaptation to the new sociocultural environment. While a great deal of research has focused on children, there is paucity of research in this area among West African children in Canada. With Saskatchewan being one of the fastest growing populations in Canada, this study sought to gain a deeper understanding of the perspectives of West African immigrant families in Saskatchewan and assess the impact of the sociocultural environment on active living among their adolescent children. Using purposive sampling, a total of 15 families residing in Saskatchewan were interviewed. Children between 10 to 17 years and their parents were interviewed in each family. A grounded theory methodological approach by Charmaz (2014) was used in this study. This involved an immersion phase, a conceptual phase, and a constant comparative analytical process. The analysis allowed for emergence of themes. Both the children and their parents reported having experiential knowledge of physical activity and benefits. The children and their parents also showed some negative acculturative experiences associated with active living. They reported facilitators of physical activity for the children such as school influence, peer influence, and parental role-modelling. The children showed an inherent interest in engaging in risky play. Both the children and their parents reported beneficial outcomes of engaging in physical activity together as a family. Finally, parental positive and negative reinforcements was reported in relation to domestic activities. This study contributes to a conceptual understanding of the knowledge regarding internal, external, and transitional factors impacting the active living and well-being of West African children in Canada.

This critical theory study used a focus group and follow-up individual interviews to illuminate how five adult bicultural Koreans residing in the U.S. negotiate their sociocultural identities within the context of U.S. imperialist influences. Interpretive phenomenological analysis (Smith & Osborn, 2008) and methods drawn from feminist research (Anderson & Jack, 1991) were employed to analyze the data. The analysis of the focus group and individual interviews suggested that participants were influenced by their experiences of immigration, racialization, racism, and racial triangulation in the U.S. Moreover, participants' accounts manifested hegemonic ideologies of color-blindness and individualism, and revealed a mixture of false consciousness and critical consciousness about racism within the U.S. That is, colorblind ideology and individualistic ideology appeared to obscure the role of racialization and racism, resulting in a false consciousness. At the same time, participants also manifested a critical understanding of history and the call for sociopolitical activism. Additionally, participants' narratives revealed internalized beliefs about the superiority of the U.S. versus the inferiority of Korea. Although most participants explicitly denied the impact of these factors on their bicultural identity, they implicitly acknowledged ways in which the asymmetrical power dynamics between the U.S. and Korea on the global stage, and between White Americans and ethnic Koreans within the U.S., influence their negotiation of sociocultural identities. The present findings have theoretical and practical implications for understanding and working with bicultural Koreans within the U.S. First, identity theory and clinical practice associated with bicultural Koreans needs to attend to the experiences of loss of power, racism, and assimilation. Second, it is important to attend to the role of ideologies in bicultural Koreans' identity negotiation. Third, there needs to be a focus on the influence of false consciousness in bicultural Koreans' identities. Finally, because bicultural Koreans' internalization of the inferiority of Korean culture appears to influence their identities as Korean and American, this internalization should be attended to theorizing about and counseling with bicultural Koreans.

This pattern reflects the long-standing socio-political history between the U.S. and Mexico and is well-documented in the sociological literature along with discussion of transnational context. Despite data to suggest that serial migration separations increase risk for depression for both parents and children when compared to non-separated immigrant counterparts, few studies have specifically investigated the effects of these separations on individual-level and family-level outcomes. This study uses an acculturative stress model to examine the effects of serial-migration family separations on parent depression, family cohesion and general family functioning. Part of this study also served as a pilot phase for developing a measure to assess parents' appraisals of family separation and reunion experiences. Data were collected from a community sample of Mexican immigrant parents (N=53; 72% mothers) via surveys administered in Spanish by researchers. Seventy percent of the sample experienced a separation from at least one child during immigration to the U.S. A relatively high percentage (43.4%) met clinical cutoff scores for depression, but there was no significant difference in scores between separated status and non-separated status groups. These groups also did not differ on any family-level outcomes. Even though results did not support the proposed mediation models to predict depression or family-level outcomes, separated status parents reported significantly higher levels of acculturative stress than their non-separated counterparts. Pilot data suggest that negative appraisals of separation experiences were associated with higher levels of acculturative stress and depression, as well as poor family functioning and family cohesion. Overall, these findings endorse using an acculturative stress framework to understand the post-migration experiences of Mexican families in the U.S. Limitations of these findings are discussed along with suggestions for future research.

The last 15 years have seen a growth in research demonstrating increased rates of psychosis in migrant populations around the world, and in derivative literature exploring etiological hypotheses that might explain this disparity. The current study notes an absence in this literature of acknowledgement of the central role that culture, language, and transitional states play in both immigration and psychosis, which hampers a full and clinically useful understanding of what happens when these processes co-occur. To augment the literature, the author surveys topics such as anthropology's revisions to the concept of acculturation, postcolonial theories of cultural encounter and evolution, poststructuralist theories of language and meaning, and deconstructionist analysis of xenophobia's influence in the historical development of psychosis as a diagnosis, applying these to a more nuanced appreciation of the convergence of migration and psychosis. The review concludes explaining how interdisciplinary perspectives might play a larger role in guiding clinical research and training, and might allow for ways of thinking about psychosis that both improve patient care and help propel academic discourse on language, culture, meaning, and psychosis, the great conundrums of psychiatry and philosophy.

The author tests these ideas by examining variation in the generational pattern of achievement in low-income schools among Latino high school students. The author finds that changes in achievement across generations generally follow a pattern of classical assimilation with small, though not statistically significant, improvements in achievement from the first to the second generation and from the second to the third generation in both poor and nonpoor schools.

Host members’ attitudes and perceptions of immigrants’ adjustment to the host society were assessed in two experimental studies (N =251; N =124). Participants were presented with a fictitious interview with an African immigrant whose generational Status, desire for Culture Maintenance and Intercultural Contact (Study 1) or host Culture Adoption (Study 2) were manipulated (2 × 2 × 2 design). Results showed that both perceived desire for contact and for culture adoption positively affected host members’ attitudes, and that the culture adoption–attitudes relationship was partially mediated by perceived threat. These effects were stronger than those attributable to perceived Culture Maintenance. The latter variable moderated the Desire for Contact but not the Desire for Culture Adoption main effect. Moreover, Contact and Culture Adoption and generational Status all influenced the way in which host members perceived immigrants’ sociocultural adjustment. We conclude that more similarities than differences exist between the Contact and the Culture Adoption frameworks, at least in terms of their effects on majority attitudes towards immigrants.

Today's migration contexts differ significantly from those of the past. Moving within a globalized world impacts processes of risk and resilience in families. The changes imposed by migration on family processes deserve our careful study to inform better delivery of social, medical, and educational services attuned to the special needs of immigrants. Concepts from family systems theory and family therapy, supplemented with concepts from studies on migration, can be used to deepen our understanding of the family transformations brought about by migration. This chapter expands on the author's earlier writings about the dilemmas of personal, family, and social transformation faced by immigrants and their capacity to find 'both/and' solutions rather than forcing 'either/or' choices regarding cultural change (Falicov, 1998a, 2002). The chapter discusses the multidimensional, ecosystemic, comparative approach model (MECA) for understanding the experiences of migration and acculturation, the changed ecological context, and issues related to the family life cycle and family organization. It also explores variations in the experience of migration and acculturation; the loss, grief, and mourning that are characteristic of the migration experience; the impact of racism and anti-immigrant reception; and, how to successfully integrate the dual visions of continuity and change. Finally, the author discusses the emergence of resilient immigrant practices that she labels 'spontaneous rituals,' because they encapsulate in ritualized ways various family, social, and cultural restitutive attempts following migration. In addition, the author addresses situations in which migration risks test families' capacity for blending continuity and change, and may result in clinical symptoms.

By contrast, this study develops and tests a theory of imported socialization in an effort to understand how immigrants’ political socialization experiences before they left their countries of origin shape the way they view the new polity after migration; the extent to which this imported socialization affects their degree of post-migration political engagement; and finally for how long the content of immigrants’ political suitcases remains consequential during their civic lives in their new home. Specific questions examined include the extent to which immigrants’ political baggage affects the intensity and the directionality of that post-migration political engagement.

Methods: Survey of the historical development of assimilation theory and its successors and systematic comparison of key concepts in aging and immigrant incorporation theories. Results: Studies of immigrants, as well as of the life course, trace their origins to the Chicago School at the turn of the 20th century. Today, both theoretical perspectives emphasize adaptation as a time-dependent, multidimensional, nonlinear, and multidirectional process. Immigrant incorporation theories have not fully engaged with a key concern of aging theory—why there are age differences. Insights from cognitive aging and developmental biology, life-span developmental psychology, and age stratification and the life course suggest explanations for age differences in the speed of immigrant incorporation. Discussion: Theories of adaptation to aging and theories of immigrant incorporation developed so independently that they neglected the subject they have in common, namely, older immigrants. Because they address similar conceptual problems and share key assumptions, a productive dialogue between two vibrant fields is long overdue.

Prior research has shown that PWID who started injecting drugs in Puerto Rico (P.R.) tend to maintain the risky injection behaviors learned there. This study identifies the P.R.-native norms supporting the continued injection risk behavior of migrant Puerto Rican PWID in NYC to inform a culturally appropriate risk-reduction intervention. Methods: 40 migrant Puerto Rican PWID were recruited in NYC for a longitudinal qualitative study. The sample was stratified to include 20 migrants with <3 years in NYC and 20 migrants with >3-6 years in NYC. Time-location sampling was used to curb possible network bias in recruitment. Over 12 months, migrants completed semi-structured interviews at baseline, monthly follow-ups, and study exit. Analyses were guided by grounded theory. Results: Most participants (90%) reported having had chronic HCV, and 22.5% reported being HIV-positive. Syringe- and cooker-/cotton-sharing were widespread in both P.R. and NYC. The ubiquitous practice of cleaning used syringes by 'water-rinsing and air-blowing' was guided by a normative belief, learned in P.R., that 'water and air kill HIV.' Sterile syringe use was not a priority. HCV was not a concern. P.R.-native abstinence-only narratives discouraged opioid agonist treatment (OAT) enrollment among recent migrants (≤3 years). Experiences with drug dealers, prison-power groups, and injection doctors ('Gancheros') in P.R. influenced migrants’ injection risk behavior in NYC. Those who were Gancheros in P.R. continued working as Gancheros in NYC. Conclusions: Injection risks make migrant Puerto Rican PWID in NYC vulnerable to HIV/HCV. Harm reduction programs should pay closer attention to the rationales behind these injection risks. A risk-reduction intervention that incorporates the Ganchero figure may be a credible way to help migrants reduce injection risk and accept OAT and syringe exchange programs (SEP).

Prior to beginning his work at a local school district, a consultant reads that collectivism, spirituality, and interdependence are salient values of the majority culture in this particular district. A practitioner attends a conference seminar that highlights the role of acculturation theory (Kohatsu, this Handbook, Volume One; Padilla, 1980) in working with immigrant communities. Although each scenario is seemingly different, a common question binds each of these individuals. That is, how does one bridge the gap between racial-cultural counseling theory (RCT) and racial-cultural practice? At an abstract level, racial-cultural information and theories of racial-cultural counseling per se may be relatively straightforward to comprehend conceptually. Nevertheless, both practitioners and practitioners in training continue to struggle with questions of how theories of racial-cultural counseling (e.g., racial identity, acculturation), as well as their understanding of the values, beliefs, and history of a given community, can facilitate their ability to deliver culturally competent services. While the need to link RCT to practice is intuitively understandable, the framework for doing so remains surprisingly absent in the literature. Indeed, given the attention that has been devoted to developing standards of cross-cultural competence (American Psychological Association, 2003; Ponterotto & Austin, this Handbook, this volume; D. Sue, Arredondo, & McDavis, 1992; D. Sue & Torino, this Handbook, this volume), as well as developing training models (Pedersen, 1977b; A. Reynolds, 1997), training exercises (Katz, 1978; Singelis, 1998), curriculum designs (Adams, Bell, & Griffin, 1997; Carter, this Handbook, this volume; A. Reynolds, 1995), and so forth, the absence of a framework for linking RCT to practice is particularly striking. The absence of a framework seems to be due in large part to the fact that, in general, race and culture have not been included as factors in theories of counseling. Instead, they are often presented as an addendum to the psychological canon, rather than as an integral part of it. Nevertheless, in a profession that has actively strived to promote cross-cultural competence as a requisite professional foundation (D. Sue et al., 1992), logic suggests that a framework is needed to assist practitioners in utilizing the racial-cultural counseling literature to inform and enhance the cultural responsiveness of their services. To this end, the central goal of the current chapter is to examine the role of RCT in facilitating the delivery of culturally sensitive services. Specifically, the current chapter focuses on the practical interrelationships between RCT and clinical practice. Although we recognize that helping relationships may include various forms of service, for example, advocacy and consultation, we have chosen to focus the current chapter on exploring the counseling relationship for the sake of depth rather than breadth (see Vera, Buhin, Montgomery, & Shin, this Handbook, this volume). Moreover, to provide practical examples of translating theory into practice, Helms's theory of racial identity (1990, 2001) is used for illustrative purposes throughout this chapter. Consequently, we begin with a brief overview of Helms's (2001) theory of racial identity. Next, we address the philosophical assumptions underlying RCT and the relationship between philosophy and practice.

This project began as a sequel to studies then being carried out in Canada, Norway, and the United States. It expanded to include a wide range of countries, all of which are experiencing immigration to varying extents. It has involved research with more than 5,000 immigrant youth from 32 ethnocultural groups and smaller samples of their parents and their national peers (i.e., those native to the society of settlement). The study seeks to answer 3 questions. (1) How do immigrant youth live within and between two cultures? These cultures are usually those of their immigrant parents, families, and communities (their heritage culture) on the one hand, and those of their peers and the larger society on the other. We refer to this as the intercultural question. (2) How well (in personal, social, and academic areas of their lives) do immigrant youth deal with their intercultural situation? We refer to this as the adaptation question. (3) We expect that there will be variations (across individuals, ethnocultural groups, and societies of settlement) in the answers to these first two questions. Therefore, the third goal is to discover the patterns of relationships between how adolescents engage in their intercultural relations and how well they adapt. We believe that there are many possible patterns in these relationships, with variations that depend on three set of factors: (a) personal and demographic factors (including age, gender, and length of residence), (b) factors that are external to individuals and their communities (such as the cultural diversity of the society of settlement and their policies with respect to such diversity), and (c) differences between the immigrant groups and the larger society (such as differences in values, and religion). We refer to this as the cross-cultural question. See record [rid]2006-05033-000[/rid] for details of the ICSEY project.

Much of this work has questioned whether classical theories of immigrant adaptation, which assumed assimilation to be an integral part of the process of upward mobility for immigrants, are still applicable to today's immigrant children. This study reevaluates the applicability of classical assimilation theory with a comprehensive empirical assessment of the relationship between assimilation and the well-being of Hispanic and Asian immigrant adolescents. Using Add Health data, we examine the effect of different aspects of assimilation on educational achievement, psychological well-being, and at-risk behaviors. We find that the effect of assimilation varies greatly depending on the ethnic group and outcome under consideration, but that it is generally related to both greater academic achievement and more at-risk behavior. We conclude that assimilation theory is still relevant, but suggest an interpretation that emphasizes a process of decreasing differences between groups rather than either detrimental or beneficial effects of assimilation.

The study also examined how union formation patterns differ across groups of Jamaican women (i.e. born and living in Jamaica, 1st generation Jamaican immigrants, 1.5 generation Jamaicans, 2nd generation, and beyond). It is important to study West Indian union formation patterns since the West Indian immigration rate has been increasing. The black West Indian population in the U.S. grew by about 67% between 1990 and 2000. The growth rate of the black West Indian population is greater than that of other established groups such as the Cubans and Koreans (Logan & Deane, 2003). This study focused specifically on Jamaicans since the bulk of the West Indian migrants is from Jamaica (Peach, 1995). Moreover, they represent both the diversity of modes of incorporation in the U.S. and the range of occupational backgrounds and immigrant status among contemporary immigrants (from professionals and entrepreneurs to laborers, refugees and unauthorized migrants). I used the Reproductive Health Survey 2002 for the analysis of the Jamaican women in Jamaica and the Census 2000 (5% PUMS) for the analysis of non-Hispanic white American and non-Hispanic African women. I also used the National Survey of Family Growth 2002 (NSFG 2002) to assess data quality and for purposes of comparison. I found that Jamaican women’s union formation patterns followed the segmented assimilation model where marriage rates tended to decline across generation and cohabitation rates tended to increase across generation that resembled more the union formation patterns of non-Hispanic African American women. Also, I found that out partnership increased across generation where Jamaican women had much greater odds of out partnering with a non-Hispanic African American partner compared to partnering with a non-Hispanic white American partner.

However, the experience is not the same for every family. The study was conducted in South Florida where there are three major immigrant groups: Hispanics, Haitians and Jamaicans. Families from these groups seem to acculturate in different ways into the American culture and migration among them impacts parents, spouses and children differently. This study focuses on Jamaican families, and their acculturation process due to migration. Qualitative analysis of family experiences among Jamaican families who migrated from Jamaica to the United States at three specific time frames, 6 months, 2 to 4 years and 10 years provided information to create the Jamaican migration theory. Grounded theory techniques were used to study the interviews of participating Jamaican families that met the criteria above. The data obtained were thoroughly analyzed using microanalysis, a grounded theory technique. Microanalysis calls for a specific analysis of data; a process that entails listening very closely to what families say, and how they actually said it (Strauss & Corbin, 1998). Analysis of the data is an intense process where the data are constantly reviewed and analyzed until distinct themes emerge. These themes become the foundation for theories that come into view after continued analysis. This study posits the Jamaican migration theory as represented by findings that indicated how Jamaican families acculturate into the American culture over time.

A grounded theory study was conducted to develop a substantive theory of Iraqi refugee resettlement. Participants in the qualitative study included 29 Iraqi refugees and 2 community partners who participated in face-to face interviews. Data analysis and interpretation revealed fundamental concepts related to Iraqi refugee resettlement. Results of analysis showed that for Iraqis choosing to resettle here, the outcome is dichotomous: satisfaction or regret. The outcome is influenced by contextual factors as well as facilitating and hindering intervening conditions during the basic social process of resettlement transition. Each refugee's story is unique, yet all share common threads. This study allowed Iraqi refugees the opportunity to voice their personal experiences of resettling in America, and revealed life stories that inspire and illuminate a process that can guide health care delivery as they cope with the stresses of their journey. As a result, an in-depth storyline was established to explain the process of resettlement for Iraqi refugees. The development of this resettlement theory, grounded in Iraqi refugee experience, has the potential to guide nursing education, enhance the efficacy of practice, inform policy development and form the basis for research.

The over reliance on cultural explanations for immigrant health outcomes has been the topic of growing debate, with the critics’ main concern being that such explanations obscure the impact of structural factors on immigrant health disparities. In this paper, we highlight the shortcomings of cultural explanations as currently employed in the health literature, and argue for a shift from individual culture-based frameworks, to perspectives that address how multiple dimensions of inequality intersect to impact health outcomes.

This qualitative study used grounded theory development to build a process-oriented and context-sensitive model of bicultural adjustment that was 'grounded' in the perspectives 14 college-age Asian Indian immigrant women living in the mid-Atlantic U.S. This qualitative methodology had the purpose of generating theory about how acculturating Indian women experience, think about, and cope with bicultural demands. Fourteen initial interviews and three follow-up interviews were conducted using a semi-structured and open-ended format. Interviews emphasized respondents' explanations while minimizing contamination from existing conceptual frameworks and observer-based assumptions. The emergent theoretical framework centered on the core category negotiating cultural discrepancies in autonomy, which was embedded within a rich network of linkages among contextual conditions, developmental demands, action strategies, and consequences. Respondents specified five central life domains or contexts (e.g., dating, marriage system, social activities, education and career development, and living independently) and numerous domain-specific rules. The immigrant women identified that decision-making autonomy and belief in individual vs. collective responsibility (please self vs. please others ) strongly influenced their choice of coping strategies. The framework also clarified numerous contextual influences comprised of people pulls, environmental pulls, developmental pulls, and gender role expectations. Additionally, the following process-mediating variables emerged as resources or obstacles across all respondents and life domains: effective vs. ineffective parent-child communication, parental familiarity vs. unfamiliarity with U.S. norms, and availability vs. lack of social support. Finally, the theoretical framework elucidated domain-specific bicultural negotiation strategies. Grounded theory methods clarified that the broad constructs of autonomy and negotiating intercultural discrepancies have divergent meanings both within life spheres and for different people. Current findings can inform preventive interventions that teach adaptive coping skills to young immigrants.

This has certainly helped making Migration Studies one of the fastest growing fields in the social sciences, but it also created a certain pressure to produce fast and 'digestible' results. To find about the actual 'state of knowledge' in integration/assimilation research is difficult, because of the increasing amount of studies on specific cases, groups or problems, but also because there is a lack of agreed-upon theoretical and methodological concepts and indicators. Segmented assimilation theory has also been quite influential here, and many scholars have tried to apply it to European contexts. More explicitly than 'assimilation', the term 'integration' includes structural aspects of incorporation into society, especially with regard to educational achievements and access to the labour market. As part of the tradition of the stronger welfare states in Western Europe, there are more actively designed policies targeting ethnic minority groups to overcome inequalities. The differences between 'assimilation' and 'integration' reflect different discourses and institutional arrangements responding to the challenge of rapidly changing demographic realities as much in the US as in Europe.

With a qualitative grounded theory methodology (Strauss & Corbin, 1990), multiple data collection methods (open-ended interviews, researcher's journal, and document review) and multiple sources of data (parents, children, and other Chinese informants) were employed to ensure research trustworthiness. Seven recent immigrant Chinese families were primary participants in the study. The convergence and divergence of the accounts of the participants and other informants put forward an immigrant Chinese folk theory. The findings comprise four sections: (a) accounts of the parents; (b) accounts of the children; (c) visible minority experiences; and (d) role of parental expectations. Based on their cultural beliefs and life experiences, the parents mainly addressed their expectations in five areas, namely school achievement, career aspirations, integration of two cultures, moral character, and leadership role. The children expressed their perceptions of parental expectations, their anxious thoughts and feelings, and their self-expectations. All participants shared their thoughts on racial discrimination, visible minority ideology, and dreams of prosperity. Both parents and children affirmed that parental expectations fostered goal orientation, mastery learning experiences, internal control beliefs, and study habits. The study has demonstrated that the relationship between parental expectations of the Chinese immigrants and their children's school achievement is significantly shaped by the dynamic and complex interplay of multiple forces such as indigenous cultural expectations, personal life experiences, and the challenges of acculturation. High parental expectations and children's striving for excellence are rooted in Chinese cultural heritage and are situationally motivated and historically transformed in different ways in response to the demands of the Canadian sociocultual context. By giving voice to this fastest-growing yet under-researched largest visible minority group in Canada, the study makes educational experiences of the Chinese immigrants intelligible to the general public as well as to policy makers. It lends insights to the importance and necessity of anti-racism education. It assists immigrant Chinese parents and children to achieve mutual understanding in the process of acculturation. It also helps teachers and counsellors understand the cultural and family factors involved in schooling for immigrant Chinese children, so as to provide more efficient social and academic mentoring for non-mainstream children, and ultimately to enhance future school-home collaboration.

To fill this gap, I draw on 123 in-depth interviews with 92 undocumented and 31 recently legalized Latino young adults, ages 20–35. Unlike existing scholarship, I examine the experiences of individuals from a range of education levels and address experiences outside of educational institutions (e.g. work, family formation). I find that undocumented young adults experience incomplete incorporation because structural barriers prevent them from fully participating in society in the ways that they desire and expect, giving rise to feelings of exclusion. Specifically, I explore how their undocumented status limits their participation and feelings of belonging in educational, economic, and social institutions. I also address how educational status and gender intersect with the limitations of their undocumented status to differentiate their experiences. While assimilation theorists conceptualize immigrant incorporation as participation in various social institutions, I contend that we must also examine feelings of belonging as a distinct aspect of incorporation. Thus, I re-conceptualize immigrant incorporation as the process through which an immigrant becomes a full member of society, not only by participating in social institutions but also by asserting feelings of belonging. This highlights the understudied dimension of emotional exclusion, and demonstrates how it intersects with structural exclusion to limit incorporation.

In a theoretical application utilizing the new community-focused framework, sociohistorical accounts of and discourse on Filipino experiences prior to the beginnings of the Filipino diaspora to Canada in the mid-1990s and more recent Filipino immigrant settlement experiences in Canada were used to examine and gain greater understanding of racial minority immigrant acculturation.

We can show that classical versions of assimilation theories, concepts of symbolic religiosity, of religiosity as a compensation for a lack of social status, or of a high intergenerational stability of values in general cannot fully explain this phenomenon. Religiosity does not decline between the first and the second generation, nor does it become more symbolic in character. Furthermore, empirical evidence yields only limited support for the hypothesis that high levels of individual religiosity can only be found among structurally and socially less assimilated segments of the immigrant population. The same holds true for the argument that they just reflect generally high intergenerational value stability among immigrants. Concequently, in the final section we discuss the role of contextual factors in explaining intergenerational stability in migrants' religiosity such as an increasing diversity of the religious Islamic field or the salience religion as a symbolic boundary marker between natives and migrants.

According to the International Organization for Migration, the number of migrants worldwide was 244 million in 2015. Current literature in cross-cultural adaptability describes acculturation as a 4-phase process, namely honeymoon, crisis, adjustment, and biculturalism (Sawyer, 2012). This approach characterizes all migrants equally, regardless of the type of migrant. This approach however is missing other factors such as an individual’s developmental stage, needs, interests, and exposed/reinforcing memes. Orientations of these characteristics can vary drastically from one immigrant to another, and play an important role in acculturation outcomes. For a successful transition, immigrants and natives alike need to form successful relationships, while immigrants discover how systems work in the new country, and learn how to pursue their goals using the new resources in their new environment. These adaptive behaviors displayed by immigrants and natives are analyzed using stage theory, Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, interests, and memes. In this article, we explore why some individuals and groups adapt better than others. A low-acculturated immigrant operates at a lower stage, may have been and continue to be exposed to memes that are less diverse, have lower needs, and choose more traditional careers. A highly acculturated immigrant operates at a higher stage, may be exposed to more diverse memes, have higher needs and choose more nontraditional careers. Through this analysis, we hope to contribute to a better understanding of immigration processes of different immigrants.

Whereas cross-sectional studies have shown support for these theory-informed relations, comparatively little is known about whether acculturation mismatch negatively affects psychological functioning, or whether offspring’s psychological problems precipitate greater perceived acculturation mismatch via intergenerational cultural conflict. Furthermore, more research is needed to investigate how acculturation and family conflict affect Asian Americans transitioning into college and emerging adulthood. Across two measurement occasions, two cohorts of Asian American first-year college students (N = 555, Mage = 17.99, 56.0% women) completed survey questionnaires assessing their perception of parent–offspring acculturation discrepancies, acculturation-related intergenerational conflict, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. For both sets of psychological functioning, gender invariant structural equation models testing the bidirectional relations demonstrated adequate fit for the data. In the case of externalizing symptoms, acculturation mismatch marginally significantly predicted subsequent intergenerational conflict, but acculturation mismatch did not predict externalizing symptoms via intergenerational cultural conflict. By contrast, offspring’s internalizing and externalizing symptoms respectively predicted greater self-reported intergenerational cultural conflict, which in turn predicted perceived parent–offspring acculturation mismatch over time. These indirect relations suggested that both internalizing and externalizing symptoms indirectly contributed to greater acculturation mismatch through the presence of intergenerational cultural conflict, but data did not support the acculturation gap-distress theory.

Tests of the 'acculturation hypothesis' have established that disparities in certain risks for low birth weight exist between subgroups of women of Mexican-origin. However, disparities observed by neighborhood of residence have yet to be explained. Most tests of the acculturation hypothesis assume a classical path of assimilation, whereby Mexican American health is expected to deteriorate with time spent residing in the U.S. and across the generations. The theory of segmented assimilation suggests that alternative paths are possible depending upon individual characteristics and the context of the neighborhood into which immigrant families and their children reside. This study tested the theory of segmented assimilation as a framework for examining the geographic, cultural, and socioeconomic underpinnings of population differences in infant low birth weight among women of Mexican descent in California using the 2000 U.S. Census and population-based data from the Maternal and Infant Health Assessment (1999–2005) (n = 6442). Little support was found for the theory’s hypotheses. Rather, increased odds for infant low birth weight were observed for English speakers residing in Latino immigrant neighborhoods when compared to English speakers in other neighborhoods, an effect attenuated for Spanish speakers. Elevated odds of low birth weight were also observed among English speakers residing in Latino immigrant neighborhoods when compared to Spanish speakers in the same neighborhoods. Findings suggest the transfer of health-specific social capital in ethnic neighborhoods may depend upon sociocultural consonance between individuals and neighborhood residents. The authors call for additional research that sheds light on the sociocultural dynamics of maternal and infant health at multiple levels.

I also take into account five key social structural factors that segmented assimilation theory and research overlook: (1) the intergenerational nature of assimilation, (2) life course stage, (3) where immigrants start out on their paths of assimilation, or their 'starting points,' (4) gender, and (5) immigrant generational status. Binomial and multinomial logistic regression analyses reveal that paths of assimilation and the factors associated with them differ according to starting point, gender, immigrant generational status, and, in the case of intragenerational assimilation, life course stage. These associations are enormously complicated and do not follow a coherent pattern. Nonetheless, a number of my findings contradict segmented assimilation's claims. For example, blacks from intermediate economic starting points have more positive mobility outcomes than whites. Additionally, elements traditionally associated with minority oppositional subcultures, such as negative views of race relations in the U.S. and experiences of discrimination, are related to positive economic mobility and classical acculturation paths for children of immigrants. These results indicate that exposure to native minorities may not have the detrimental effects that segmented assimilation alleges. Among the protective factors, while parent-youth relationships are consistently important for predicting economic and cultural assimilation, I find little evidence that cultural attachments promote greater economic success among immigrants' offspring. These results suggest that immigrants' cultural attributes may be less important for their success than the quality of their family relationships.

As younger generations acculturate to the United States (US) environment, there is potential for a restructuring of their medical culture resulting in a loss or silencing of pertinent cultural information regarding traditional medicine and therapies.

Different methods have been developed to assess various aspects of sleep. This chapter covers the most established and common methods used to assess sleep in infants and children. These methods include polysomnography, videosomnography, actigraphy, direct observations, sleep diaries, and questionnaires. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are highlighted.

The model is derived from an integration of three distinct theoretical traditions: Social Representations Theory (SRT), Social Identity Theory (SIT), and Berry's model of acculturation tendencies (BAT). SRT describes the content of identities, and contends that they are context and time specific constructions largely shared by members of a society, by which they locate themselves relative to other social sectors within a shared meta-system. SRT theory does not offer specific instrumental operations for its measurement. SIT and BAT, in contrast, offer instrumental operations (strategies) derived from each theory. According to Tajfei, immigrants as well as minority groups seek ways to enhance their social status. Berry, however, focuses on immigrant acculturation tendencies resulting from their positioning between their original culture and their new one. In our model, we combined strategies from each of the theories, but instead of choosing between them, based on SRT, we used Gunman's method of Smallest Space Analysis to explore how the immigrants and their non-immigrant peers constructed the strategies discussed in the SIT and BAT models. Based on this theoretical rationale, the research hypothesis predicted that a shared construction of immigrant identities would be found for immigrants and native high school students (as suggested by SRT), and that immigrant identities would be constructed according to dimensions of power and acculturation tendencies (in line with SIT and BAT). The findings, based on 621 high school students, supported these hypotheses.

The responsibility for change was placed solely on the immigrant group. By the 1960s, theorists had redefined assimilation to acknowledge different paths of integration influenced by interactions of immigrant group characteristics with the host society context. Modern theories branching from classic assimilation theory include segmented assimilation and spatial assimilation and theories focusing on ethnic group influences.

Service providers that work within this community noted significant levels of problematic alcohol consumption among Bhutanese-Nepali refugees. This alcohol misuse was noted to be associated with intimate partner violence and major health problems among refugees. The goal of this dissertation was twofold; to examine the relationships between social barriers and the sources of strain that refugees deal with in their daily lives, and to explore the link between these barriers and adverse behavioral outcomes such as problem drinking and violence. Agnew's (1992) General Strain Theory (GST) is used to explain the relationship between refugee barriers and deviant behavioral outcomes. This research is based on an analysis of 66 qualitative interviews collected from April to July 2017 with 100 Bhutanese-Nepali refugees from a single community. Findings show that major sources of strain for Bhutanese-Nepali refugees include language acquisition, employment problems, and acculturation stress. These sources of strain contribute to problem drinking behaviors due to a lack of coping resources among Bhutanese-Nepali refugees that would support non-deviant coping. The use of alcohol to cope may then contribute to criminal behavioral outcomes such as intimate partner violence. These findings imply that interventions aimed at reducing problematic alcohol use within this community must also be aimed at reducing the underlying sources of refugee strains that can lead to the misuse of alcohol and the negative consequences thereof.

In investigating the position of coloured, immigrant youth in Great Britain this model of an integrative social system articulated through common values is inadequate and moreover misleading. It leads to conceptualizing the problems in terms of value differences and sees the resolution of these problems in terms of adequate socialization for integration into British society. The social position of youth cannot be separated from the overall social structure in which it is located nor can the approach to youth, as a sociological problem, be understood apart from the general theoretical scheme which is used, implicitly or explicitly, to define and analyze the problem. In putting forward a perspective in which the 'problems' associated with youth can be seen as more general problems, many areas frequently associated with youth have been neglected. The aim of the paper has been, however, not to cover 'youth problems' comprehensively but to argue that a new approach to the subject, which puts it firmly into a framework of dialectical structural change, will prove more fruitful both for the analysis of past work and for future research.

The objectives of this dissertation are threefold: First, to develop an expanded and integrated explanatory model of Latino acculturative stress that accounts for culture, stress and coping, cognitive appraisal, timing, and family and neighborhood factors; second, to evaluate the reliability and validity evidence of the English language version of the CESD-R; and third, to evaluate the reliability and validity evidence of the Spanish language version of the CESD-R. The first manuscript posits an explanatory model that expands upon and integrates work by Berry (2006) and most notably adds the dimension of family and neighborhood. Recent research findings on Latino immigrant depression point toward the importance of understanding and leveraging the protective nature of neighborhood and family (Breslau, 2011; Shell, Peek, & Eschbach, 2013). The second manuscript evaluates the validity and reliability evidence of the English language version of the CESD-R. The results of an EFA, CFAs, and a multiple-group CFA of the English version of the CESD-R suggest that a 15-item version of the CESD-R best fit the study data. The final two-factor solution of negative mood and functional impairment and suicide, fit the data well. The third manuscript evaluates the reliability and validity evidence of the Spanish language version of the CESD-R. The scores of the Spanish Language version of the CESD-R fit the same CESD-R factor structure of Manuscript II. The results support the use of the 15-item version of the CESD-R with a Spanish speaking sample. This suggests that despite cultural differences, there are common cross-cultural components of depression that relate to negative mood and functional impairment and suicide.

Within such communities, international migration becomes so deeply rooted that the prospect of transnational movement becomes normative: young people 'expect' to live and work in the US at some point in their lives. Males, especially, come to see migration as a normal part of the life course, representing a marker of the transition to manhood, in addition to being a widely accepted vehicle for economic mobility. International migration is cultural in the sense that the aspiration to migrate is transmitted across generations and between people through social networks. In this article, the authors develop a formal theory of the culture of migration and test it using 7,061 students in grades 6-12 (ages 9-23). Results show that children from families involved in US migration are more likely to aspire to live and work in the US and that these aspirations, in turn, influence their behavior, lowering the odds that they will continue in school, and raising the odds of their eventual out-migration to the US.

W. Winnicott).",1,NA,"Every year a great number of women immigrate from Poland to the United States. Adjustment to a new culture is a difficult process and can have an impact on a woman's self, self image, and identity. The creation of identity requires a culture with systems, language, and images. Therefore, how can a woman recreate her own identity and find new meaning of the self in a new culture? This is an important question not only for the individuals themselves but for those who work with them. Due to the lack of attention paid to this group, mental health professionals and others who provide services to them may be unaware of the particular issues these women face. These women face challenges to their identity and sense of self that can be best explained from a psychodynamic point of view. Therefore, using the heuristic research model, this theoretical research investigates the impact of immigration and living in the bicultural environment on the self structure of young Polish immigrant women. Concepts from two different theoretical orientations, self psychology and Winnicott's and his followers' theories, are used to examine the emergence of the self in this particular immigrant group. Specific emphasis is put on the process of reconstruction of the self in the bicultural environment. The dissertation begins with an explanation of pre-immigration and immigration stages and a discussion of the structure of the self among young Polish immigrant women. Next, an investigation of the process of assimilation to a new environment is conducted. After this, the concept of the bicultural space, seen as significant in understanding the bicultural woman's inner experience, is introduced. Then, in order to illustrate these concepts and provide a portrayal of a typical Polish immigrant, the hypothetical case of a young Polish woman named Anna is presented. Finally, the concept of the bicultural identity is presented, followed by a discussion of the research, including the analysis of five models of second culture acquisition and the incorporation of new findings.

The second part discusses a retreat from multiculturalism policies in three states that had been prominently committed to them: Australia, the Netherlands, and Britain. This practical retreat of multiculturalism is due to a variety of factors, their importance differing across cases: the chronic lack of public support for multiculturalism policies; inherent deficits and failures of multiculturalism policies, especially in socio-economic respect; and a new assertiveness of the liberal state to impose liberal principles.

Among Latinos, important cultural factors include familial support, immigration, and acculturation/enculturation. Previous research has emphasized the importance of taking into account stressors related to immigration and the acculturation process. These findings highlight the importance of examining these cultural factors to further our understanding of the victimization-delinquency overlap among Latino youth. Extending this body of literature to include factors salient to Latinos is particularly timely given the recent rapid growth of this population in the United States. One approach for conceptualizing the victimization-delinquency overlap is to examine the relationship within a general strain theory (GST) framework. However, there are several gaps in the GST literature that this study intends to address. First, a more nuanced, culturally-sensitive understanding of the victimization-delinquency overlap among Latino youth will be gained from the proposed study. Second, the concept of victimization will be expanded to include a measure of polyvictimization, which has not been examined in previous GST studies. Finally, this study proposes to evaluate the role of several key emotions as mediators in the GST process. The findings of this study are important for shaping policy and clinical practice, including school- and family-based interventions, and mental health treatment. The overarching goal of research on the victimization-delinquency overlap, and GST more specifically, is to better understand how victimized individuals go on to commit crime and thus develop prevention programs to dissuade criminal behavior. It is important to consider, however, that a one-size-fits-all approach to crime prevention may not be most effective. Thus, incorporating cultural factors into the study of GST among Latino youth can help elucidate which cultural factors protect these adolescents from engaging in criminal activity and provide recommendations for relevant crime prevention policy.

While the theory has been interpreted in many different ways, we emphasize its implications for the important role of social context: both processes and consequences of assimilation should depend on the local social context in which immigrants are embedded. We derive empirically falsifiable hypotheses about the interaction effects between social context and assimilation on immigrant children’s well-being. We then test the hypotheses using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Our empirical analyses yield two main findings. First, for immigrant adolescents living in non-poverty neighborhoods, we find assimilation to be positively associated with educational achievement and psychological well-being but also positively associated with at-risk behavior. Second, there is little empirical evidence supporting our hypotheses derived from segmented assimilation theory. We interpret these results to mean that future research would be more fruitful focusing on differential processes of assimilation rather than differential consequences of assimilation.

It expressed a new appreciation of the danger to Whites of conflict based on colour. Before 1905 most observers assumed the inferiority of Blacks and saw race conflict as the fault of African Americans. But a new possibility arose when the fate of African Americans was linked to the rising power of Japan, occurring after the defeat of Russia by Japan in 1904–5. Race conflict, in this new model, was a form of conflict between nations. Race relations pioneer Robert E. Park, in his 1913 article, ‘Racial Assimilation in Secondary Groups’, noted that ‘under conditions . . . of individual liberty and individual competition, characteristic of modern civilization, depressed racial groups tend to assume the form of nationalities. A nationality, in this narrower sense, may be defined as the racial group which has attained self-consciousness, no matter whether it has at the same time gained political independence or not.’ Yuill's paper will explore the thesis that a liberal perspective based on developments in contemporary international relations slowly changed the way race was regarded in the United States. From 1905 onwards, a new liberal paradigm sought to manage race conflict. It was this—rather than labour-based racial antipathies or commitment to racial equality—that shaped US race relations in the twentieth century.

Importantly, with the ever-present migration of persons across countries and cultures, physical boundaries of language have been blurred creating a robust area of study: language brokering in the context of globalization. Migration and immigration often necessitate the learning of a new language and in immigrant families, open an opportunity for language skill differences and language brokering. Language brokering is a process by which a bilingual individual, often the children of immigrants, assists in communication between two parties speaking distinct languages. This common practice has generated an increased focus and body of research on the current and aftereffects of language brokering on individuals who broker. The present article provides a brief review of the literature on language brokering including identified antecedents and select outcomes such as family, academic, and psychological outcomes. Overall, the literature shows the associations among language brokering, the contexts in which it may occur, and the outcomes (family, academic, and psychological) for language brokers remain less than clearly understood, although inroads are being made as researchers delve more deeply into specific areas such as parentification, age, child development, and family dynamics.

Research suggests, however, that immigrant families who maintain a balance between retaining pieces of their home culture while incorporating parts of the new (in other words, who find an integration of the different cultures) experience the best outcomes. Maintaining some values and customs from the country of origin may be better for the mental health of the family members. Moreover, involvement in ethnic community networks in the new country is also critical in buffering against discrimination, creating some continuity, and coping with some of the inevitable social and cultural losses. Indeed, recreating ethnic community networks highly correlates with general health and mental health as well. With the ever-increasing diversity among immigrant families in the United States, each with distinct cultural norms and values, varying migration, and living arrangements, as well as unique familial patterns, the validity and usefulness of traditional models of family therapy may be outdated, at least when universally applied. Family therapists are finding it increasingly necessary to both select relevant techniques among various models and fit their approaches to the needs of the clients rather than the other way around.

There is a paucity of research on theory of mind development in older children from low SES and ethnic minority communities, as well as children from cultures outside the United States and Western Europe. There is no research on the relation between language brokering, theory of mind ability, and academic achievement. This study uses both a cultural approach and a theory of mind approach to study the socio-cognitive development of Latino preadolescents from immigrant families. Participants were 117 Mexican American 6th graders (M = 11.33 years; 56 girls, 61 boys) from a semi-rural agricultural community in Oregon. Each participant completed a questionnaire consisting of the Language Brokering Scale, the Short Acculturation Scale for Hispanic Youth, the Parent-Child Bonding Scale, and demographic information. Participants also completed tests of receptive English vocabulary (PPVT-III), receptive Spanish vocabulary (TVIP), and responded to two theory of mind vignettes developed to assess higher order theory of mind ability. Participants who reported being chosen as the primary language broker out-performed non-primary language brokers on theory of mind ability, things brokered, GPA, and reading achievement test scores. Girls out-performed boys on theory of mind ability, biculturalism, Spanish vocabulary, and GPA. Non-primary girls language brokered for more people than primary girls, and non-primary boys language brokered for less people than primary boys. Non-primary girls also reported more biculturalism than any other sub-group. English vocabulary, language broker order, and feelings about brokering were positively related to theory of mind ability for boys. Language broker order and biculturalism were positively related to theory of mind ability for girls. The relationship between theory of mind ability and academic achievement was non-existent for girls, and seemed to be masked by language brokering variables for boys.

Though successful integration is important, research has shown that ethnic identity and participation in the ethnic culture of origin play a key role in supporting the mental health of resettled refugees. This paper presents a model that draws on social-cognitive theory, trauma theory, and models of second culture acquisition to reflect relationships between trauma, mental health, and self-efficacy. The model presents the concept of bicultural self-efficacy as a potential outcome measure for facilitating inter-disciplinary research and practice efforts.

Elements include cultural views of using alcohol and other drugs, life problems, seeking help, relapse, and recovery. Acculturation, subgroup identity, and migration are critically important variables in the framework. The framework can be used to view a single culture or to compare several and can help clinicians explore clients' earliest exposure to alcohol and other drugs, family and community messages regarding AOD use, and stigma and shame. It can stimulate clinicians' thinking about culturally specific intervention methods and family and community supports for recovery.

First, their intentions were categorized as either purposeful or expedient, and either differential or assimilative. With basic analyses, the validity of the categorization was supported. Causal factors explaining intention were examined through hierarchical logistic regression models. The intention to acquire local voting right increased through differential factors, while it decreased through factors that pointed toward resistance against assimilation. The intention to acquire voting rights increased through general attitudes and attributions independent of individual factors, and these variables had little to do with assimilation. The intention to naturalize increased through affection toward Japan, and decreased through ethnic self-esteem as 9 Korean. This suggests that the intent to naturalize is assimilative. These analyses indicate the necessity of an active role on the part of the social environment for purposeful naturalization which preserves the ethnic identity of the Koreans.
