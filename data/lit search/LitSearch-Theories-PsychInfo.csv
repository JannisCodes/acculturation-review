"A comparison of conceptual models of depression and anxiety in Chinese Americans and European Americans and the role of culture.","Ferri, Lucia Victoria","Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering",="04194217",="9781124610313",="20120101","72","7-B","4317","1","2012-99020-351",,"ProQuest Information & Learning","Dissertation","Anxiety; Cross Cultural Differences; Major Depression; Chinese Cultural Groups; Adulthood (18 yrs & older)",,"The underutilization and poor engagement of Chinese American populations in professional mental health services within the United States has been well documented (Akutsu, Snowden, & Organista, 1996; Bui & Takeuchi, 1992; Ying & Hu, 1994). Though a number of barriers toward professional treatment of this minority population have been considered, a significant barrier, namely the unique conceptualization of mental distress within this ethnic population and its divergence from mainstream American models of illness, has rarely been explored in depth. Further, though conceptual models and beliefs about depression in different ethnic groups have been addressed, the literature on conceptual models of anxiety is scarce. This investigation explored and compared conceptual models of anxiety and depression as well as treatment preferences in a largely immigrant, adult Chinese American sample and an adult European American sample in the United States. This study further explored the relationships between the cultural variables of individualism and collectivism, acculturation, and conceptual models of depression and anxiety. Results from this study did not support hypotheses that Chinese Americans would endorse more collectivistic values than European Americans, finding only that European Americans endorsed independent self-construal values to a greater degree than Chinese Americans. Conceptual models were found to differ between ethnic groups with European American participants endorsing biopsychiatic models of depression and anxiety significantly more than Chinese American participants, though both groups were found to demonstrate mixed models including biological, situational, and psychological causes for distress. Though European Americans were found to prefer psychotherapy as treatment more than Chinese Americans, medication and lay referral treatment preferences were not found to be different between groups in quantitative analyses. Qualitative analyses, however, revealed some of the stigma attitudes in Chinese Americans regarding professional mental health treatment. Results suggested that higher American acculturation significantly correlated with chemical biological causal models and psychological models of mental health distress. However, results did not support the hypothesis that cultural values such as individualism/collectivism or independent/interdependent self construal would be better predictors of conceputal model than ethnic group background. American acculturation also was not found to moderate the relationship between ethnicity and conceptual model of distress.

We propose a conceptual framework that examines two distinct emotional experiences—ambiguous loss of homeland (ALH) and relative satisfaction (RS) between the country of origin (CO) and the host country. This framework emerges from interviews with 55 Spanish-speaking immigrants to the United States and results in four quadrants: (1) 'pulled there' (feels loss of homeland strongly and prefers CO to the United States); (2) 'neither here nor there' (does not feel loss of homeland strongly, however, prefers CO to the United States); (3) 'mostly here' (does not feel loss of homeland strongly and prefers the United States); and (4) 'here but pulled there' (feels loss of homeland strongly, however, prefers the United States). The conceptual framework of ALH and RS contributes to the immigration literature and is not exclusive to Latinos, but to the growing global immigrant and refugee population.

This critical review takes stock of the literature on exclusion of social relations. Social relations are defined as comprising social resources, social connections and social networks. An evidence review group undertook a critical review which integrates, interprets and synthesizes information across studies to develop a conceptual model of exclusion from social relations. The resulting model is a subjective interpretation of the literature and is intended to be the starting point for further evaluations. The conceptual model identifies individual risks for exclusion from social relations (personal attributes, biological and neurological risk, retirement, socio-economic status, exclusion from material resources and migration). It incorporates the evaluation of social relations, and the influence of psychosocial resources and socio-emotional processes, sociocultural, social-structural, environmental and policy contextual influences on exclusion from social relations. It includes distal outcomes of exclusion from social relations, that is, individual well-being, health and functioning, social opportunities and social cohesion. The dynamic relationships between elements of the model are also reported. We conclude that the model provides a subjective interpretation of the data and an excellent starting point for further phases of conceptual development and systematic evaluation(s). Future research needs to consider the use of sophisticated analytical tools and an interdisciplinary approach in order to understand the underlying biological and ecopsychosocial associations that contribute to individual and dynamic differences in the experience of exclusion from social relations.

Aim: The primary aim of the study is to empirically derive the factorial structure of the VDS to support its use as a culturally responsive depression screening tool in community samples of Vietnamese adults. Method: The factorial structure, reliability, and associations of the VDS factors with recognized socio-demographic correlates were examined using data collected from interviews with a non-probability community sample of 180 Vietnamese refugee adults in the Houston area. Results: The empirically derived factorial structure of the VDS approximated the theorized conceptualization of depression introduced by the scale’s originators. Three factors (depressed affect, somatic symptoms, and cultural-specific symptoms) accounted for 65% of the variance. As hypothesized, the VDS factors correlated with age and acculturation variables. Conclusion: Overall results suggest that the conceptualization of depression among this sample of Vietnamese refugees has both universal and culturally specific features. Implications for providing culturally responsive mental health services are offered.

Without adequate protections, these individuals are forced to flee to countries such as the United States and Canada. By the time sexual and gender minority asylum seekers (SGMAS) arrive in these countries, they may suffer from depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and complex trauma. SGMAS may struggle with these mental health problems while also attempting to navigate the difficulties of migration (e.g., locating housing and employment, filing an asylum claim). The extant literature on refugee and sexual and gender minority populations, however, may not provide adequate guidance to therapists who assist SGMAS. Therefore, this article presents a framework for clinical practice with SGMAS. This framework is informed by research on complex trauma, minority stress, acculturation/integration, and resilience. The 3 components of the framework are establishing safety and stability in treatment and in the environment, developing skills for managing the asylum claims process, and providing strategies for dealing with the challenges of resettlement. These components are intended to help clients to heal from trauma, handle the demands of acculturation, and cope with minority stress.

The current research, however, centers on the recipient nationals' attitudes toward immigrants and multiculturalism. Three distinctive frameworks to examine host nationals' perceptions are proposed based on (1) intergroup relations, (2) individual level differences, and (3) cultural level differences. Five studies were conducted in line with the three frameworks using attitudes toward immigrants as the common dependent measure. Based on the intergroup framework, Studies 1 and 2 examined the influence of intergroup contact, national pride, perceived permeability, fairness, intergroup threat, and host community acculturation strategies. Results showed that decreased contact and increased threat predicted less favorable perception toward immigrants (Study 1); respondents who espoused a need for immigrant assimilation and exclusionism, and those who espoused a less individualistic perception toward migration expressed more negative immigrant attitudes (Study 2). In the second framework on individual differences, the influence of personal enduring dispositions on immigrant attitudes was examined. The independent variables included social dominance orientation, self-esteem, individualism-collectivism, national pride, and Schwartz's personal values. Low self-esteem and individualism, and high social dominance predicted less favorable attitudes toward immigrants. Furthermore, high social dominance predicted less favorable perceptions but only among host nationals who also rated high on individualism (Study 3). Regarding personal values orientation, respondents who placed greater emphasis on security and achievement motivation expressed more negative attitudes, but endorsement of the stimulation value type predicted more favorable perceptions (Study 4). In the third and final framework, effects of cultural differences on immigrant attitudes were examined (Study 5). Secondary data from the Eurobarometer [Eurobarometer, 2000.

Method: Acculturation was assessed with the ARSMA-II (Studies 1 and 2), and language proficiency items from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study (Study 3). Results: In Studies 1 and 2, the bidimensional model accounted for slightly more variance (R² Study 1 = .11; R² Study 2 = .21) than the unidimensional model (R² Study 1 = .10; R² Study 2 = .19). In Study 3, the bidimensional model evidenced better fit (Akaike information criterion = 167.36) than the unidimensional model (Akaike information criterion = 1204.92).

One construct that has been quite popular in attempting to explain this cultural change process is called acculturation. The purpose of this chapter is to explore psychological theories related to acculturation and a closely related construct (enculturation), measurement of these constructs, and research findings bearing on the relations between these constructs and psychological experiences among racial minorities.

Schwartz, Marilyn J. Montgomery and Ervin Briones (see record [rid]2006-03287-001[/rid]). Schwartz et al. begin the process of developing a model with which to understand the acculturation of immigrants within the context of identity theory. To further the development of this model, in this commentary I will lay stress on the point that acculturation among immigrant people can be seen as a special form of the individualization of the life course. In their approach to acculturation among non-white, non-Western immigrants moving to Western nations, the authors argue that identity theory is essential in understanding the adjustments made as part of the acculturation process. The acculturation process is, in their view, an individual one, with each new member both adopting new beliefs and values from the receiving culture and retaining beliefs and values from the culture of origin. Although no empirical work has yet been undertaken extending the identity capital model to how immigrants specifically accrue and exchange identity capital resources, it does provide a theoretical starting point in an area that is without theoretical foundations, as noted by Schwartz, Montgomery and Briones in this issue, and alerts us to factors that can specifically advantage or disadvantage those with different backgrounds and personal characteristics.

The purpose of this paper is to contextualize the study of acculturation and adjustment by taking an ecological approach to exploring these relationships across several life domains, using a bilinear scale, and examining mediators of these relationships for adult Vietnamese refugees (N = 203) in the United States. We call this approach the Ecological Acculturation Framework (EAF). Results of a structural equation model (SEM) showed that job satisfaction fully mediated the relationship between American acculturation and psychological distress, demonstrating that this relationship was specific to an occupational domain. However, while Vietnamese acculturation predicted co-ethnic social support satisfaction, it did not predict reduced psychological distress. Implications for a life domains approach, including domain specificity, are discussed.

Existing programs tend to conflate issues related to immigrant status with ethnic or racial minorities. These programs also tend to ignore that acculturation and cultural discourse in health may vary depending on the immigrant subgroup and the host community’s social environment. This paper addresses the gap in the literature by proposing a conceptual framework that uses a socioecological perspective to outline acculturation and cultural factors in immigrants’ preventive health behaviours. To this end, we synthesized the literature on acculturation and cultural perspectives on preventive health among immigrants. We used a case study on influenza vaccination among Chinese immigrants to illustrate the importance of targeting and tailoring approaches to specific immigrant subgroups. We performed a critical examination of 10 existing influenza vaccination programs adapted for immigrants and ethnic minorities to outline their cultural sensitivity in surface- and deep- structure components. Finally, we proposed a conceptual framework integrating the acculturation factors, cultural elements, and cultural anatomy of the reviewed programs with application to Chinese immigrants as a demonstration of cultural sensitivity. The discussion includes limitations, recommendations, and future directions resulting from this framework to help inform cultural adaptation of preventive health programs for immigrants.

The bidimensional 'radex' configuration of acculturation attitudes confirms expected distinctions (a) between integration, separation, assimilation, and marginalization types of acculturation attitudes and (b) between similarly structured own immigrants' attitudes and the expectations attributed to hosts. Moreover, the distinct placement of group identifications and sociodemographic characteristics as external variables in the bidimensional space corroborates the concurrent and discriminant validity of the acculturation model and measurement.

For example, studies have examined stressors surrounding the resettlement of Central Americans in Canada and workplace stress of women in the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong as well as the US. The phenomenon of flow of professional immigrants and the accompanying acculturative stresses is not limited to the US. In fact, there have been parallel incidents of acculturative stresses in countries such as France, the UK, Germany, Israel, and Russia. What we notice in each of these cases is that acculturation and acculturative stresses are primarily confined to the professional immigrant groups who migrate from collectivistic countries of Southeast and South Asia to G8 countries. Pottie et al. (2005) examined acculturation and acculturative stress of Central American male immigrants into Canada. There have also been several studies focusing on Russian immigrants to Israel in the 1980s; however, our research shows that there have been considerably more studies of acculturation and acculturative stresses of immigrants from developing nations into the US and Canada.

Individuals such as these are contemporary pioneers venturing into an unfamiliar cultural terrain where many of the business-as-usual ways of doing things lose their relevance. Even relatively short-term sojourners must be at least minimally concerned with building a healthy functional relationship with the host environment in ways similar to the native population. As they confront their predicaments as strangers and engage in new learning for an improved 'goodness-of-fit,' they begin to undergo a gradual process of personal transformation beyond their original cultural perimeters and toward a more inclusive and less categorical self-conception and self-other orientation.

This risk seems to rise with increasing US cultural orientation and decreasing Latino cultural orientation, especially among girls. To ascertain how acculturation may influence Latino/a youth alcohol use, we integrated an expanded multi-domain model of acculturation with the Theory of Reasoned Action. Design: Participants were 302 recent Latino/a immigrant youth (141 girls, 160 boys; 152 from Miami, 150 from Los Angeles) who completed surveys at 4 time points. Youth completed measures of acculturation, attitudes toward drinking, perceived subjective norms regarding alcohol use, intention to drink, and alcohol use.Results. Structural equation modeling indicated that collectivistic values predicted more perceived disapproval of drinking, which negatively predicted intention to drink. Intention to drink predicted elevated alcohol use. Conclusion: Although the association between collectivistic values and social disapproval of drinking was relatively small (β = .19, p < .05), findings suggest that collectivistic values may help protect Latino/a immigrant youth from alcohol use by influencing their perceived social disapproval of drinking, leading to lower intention to drink. Educational preventive interventions aimed at reducing or preventing alcohol use in recent Latino/a immigrant youth could promote collectivistic values and disseminate messages about the negative consequences of drinking.

The lack of focus on process integration has inhibited our understanding of precisely why and how adjustment processes unfold and ultimately cause (dys)functional change in criteria. In response, we review the motives and processes of cross-cultural adjustment and integrate these into a theoretical framework, examining the discrete episode of expatriate-host national interaction as the focal vehicle for change. First, we synthesize the general causal sequence within an interaction episode. We then summarize state inputs that condition processing. Next, we describe identity management and learning processing in depth. Then, we discuss key interactions among the motive and processing categories. Finally, we orient the cross-cultural interaction episode within the nomological network of cross-cultural adjustment predictors and criteria. This framework prescribes that an expatriate should initially reduce acculturative stress through repeated, functional identity management and learning processing of novelty encountered in cross-cultural interaction episodes. To do so, one must avoid inhibitory input states and the many potential processing failures identified here. If the expatriate experiences enough such functional interaction episodes, a 'Stage 2' is reached where the motive to reduce stress has been largely overcome, and thereafter, interaction episode processing proceeds more functionally in general.

Iterative analyses identified themes of the transcultural domain: colonialism, immigration, discrimination, and therapeutic engagement. In this domain, the authors examine two key behavioral theory constructs, perceptions of susceptibility to illness and perceptions of benefits of preventive medical care. The findings raise concerns about interventions to promote mammography screening primarily based on provision of scientific information.

Acculturation theory provides a lens into how individuals and groups experience cultural and contextual shifts and examine more specifically the psychological and behavior challenges. The objective of this chapter is to discuss the meoretical underpinnings of acculturation theory while embedding narratives of the acculturation experience and process drawn from personal and professional knowledge. The integration of acculturation theory and inherent concepts can provide a reassuring framework upon which to rely in interpreting human integration within society and exploring responses and behaviours. Cultural humility and cultural intelligence will reduce fear of diversity and establish positive partnerships between individuals and groups. Acculturation can become a natural worldview for understanding human experience if embraced within mainstream ideologies.

In this context, cross-cultural dimensions of psychological disorders receive increased attention, especially depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorders among the migrant population. In this paper we propose a theoretical framework for the understanding of migrant mental health. This framework combines elements from Berry's acculturation model and Antonovsky's salutogenic theory. The former illustrates the main factors that affect an individual's adaptation in a new cultural context. The term acculturative stress denotes unresolved problems resulting from intercultural contact that cannot be overcome easily by simply adjusting or assimilating. The latter specifies the relationship between culturally associated stress and mental health more distinctive, introducing the concepts of generalized resistance resources and sense of coherence that determine mental health outcomes of migrants during acculturative stress periods. Specifically, we provide an integrative framework of acculturation and salutogenesis that helps to integrate inconsistent findings in the migrant mental health literature. The current paper focuses on the effect of resource factors for positive mental health outcomes in the migrant population and summarises some implications for future research activities.

Drawing upon a case study of a family originating in Calabria, Italy, and living in Adelaide, South Australia, I consider the way in which the three generations perceive their ‘being ethnic’ across time and space. The first-generation participants were born in Italy and migrated to Australia during the 1950s; the second generation are their children; and the third generation are the children of the second generation. The findings show a widespread intergenerational identification of ethnicity as ‘being Italian’, which, however, has different meanings across the three generations. This depends on the participants’ phenomenological perceptions of being thrown into the world [Heidegger, M. (1962). Being and time. (J. Macquarie & E. Robinson, Trans.). New York, NY: Harper]. Some 40 years after Huber’s [(1977). From pasta to Pavlova: A comparative study of Italian settlers in Sydney and Griffith. St Lucia: University of Queensland Press] study about the assimilation of Italian-Australians published in her book From Pasta to Pavlova, the present paper shows a movement from pavlova to pasta, especially by the third-generation participants, who experience a sense of ethnic revival. Essential in such a shift of ethnic identity is what I refer to as institutional positionality; that is, one’s perceptions of the position of one’s ‘ethnic being in the world’. This is investigated by combining with the sociology of migration, including the Bourdieusian conceptual apparatus of capital [Bourdieu, P. (1986). The forms of capital. In J. Richardson (Ed.), Handbook of theory and research in the sociology of education (pp. 241–258). New York, NY: Greenwood Press], a Heideggerian existential theory [Heidegger, 1962]. Such a juxtaposition provides further reflexivity through a reconceptualisation that considers the role of ontology in the sociology of migration.

Conflict, or the discrepancy between NV and FM, was assessed to predict psychological distress, the outcome variable in this study, among South Asian parents. The goal was to establish the generalizability of SLT as well as empirically establish areas of conflict around which psychological intervention might be beneficial. Two hundred and six volunteer South Asian subjects completed the questionnaires utilized in this study. Two samples, each consisting of 103 subjects were created with the constraint that equal numbers of males and females and equal numbers of the three main South Asian religious groups (Muslim, Hindu, and Sikh) were included in each sample. This was done to maintain independence of data due to the fact that the majority of the subject pool consisted of both members of a marital dyad. It was hypothesized that there would be a positive correlation between level of conflict (defined as magnitude of positive discrepancy when FM is subtracted from NV) and level of psychological distress as measured by the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). Empirical questions were also formulated based on variables including acculturation, ethnic identity, marital satisfaction, life stress, SLT variables, and demographics. A final empirical question, concerned with whether any of the 10 SCL-90-R subscales would be better predicted by the SLT variables, was also constructed. Overall, the main hypothesis concerning the predicted positive relationship between conflict (NV minus FM) and SCL-90-R scores was not confirmed. The two samples provided weak and somewhat mixed results. Data from Sample 1 did yield limited support for the correlation between conflict and psychological distress.

HRM literature regards migrants as confined to the host nation context, whereas Migration literature places them in a transnational context, spanning both originating and host nations. In this conceptual paper, we argue for integrating transnational perspectives into HRM literature to offer a more accurate portrayal of contemporary migrant lives, and to capture greater nuance in migrant career experiences.

This study explored risk and protective factors that influence high-risk behaviors in Hispanic adolescents. A theoretical model was developed based on an integration of Ecodevelopmental Theory and the Theory of Reasoned Action to investigate individual and social factors that affect the risk behaviors of Hispanic adolescents. This study was a cross-sectional, descriptive, secondary investigation of the baseline data of a combined sample of 493 Hispanic adolescent 7th and 8th graders and their immigrant parents who had been recruited for participation in the Familias Efficacy I and II studies. The hypothesized model of relationships included 3 direct effects variables: parent-adolescent communication about sex; adolescent condom use self-efficacy; and family functioning, which integrated 4 constructs: parental involvement; positive parenting; family communication; and parent-adolescent communication. The study model also included 3 indirect variables: parents’ acculturation; differential acculturation; and parent’s HIV knowledge. Three adolescent risk behaviors served as outcome variables: condom use; drinking alcohol while having sex; and substance use. It was hypothesized that (1) family functioning, parent-adolescent communication about sex, and adolescent self efficacy would all be directly related to adolescent risk behaviors; (2) parent’s acculturation would be related to adolescent risk behaviors indirectly through its association with parent’s HIV knowledge and parent-adolescent communication about sex; and (3) differential acculturation would be related to adolescent risk behaviors indirectly through its association with family functioning, adolescent condom use self-efficacy, and parent-adolescent communication about sex. Cronbach’s α computed for all measures yielded good to excellent reliability coefficients. Pearson linear correlation coefficients were calculated between all of the study variables, followed by confirmatory factor analysis to ascertain the feasibility of collapsing multiple indicators of family functioning and HIV/STIs risk behaviors into single latent variables. Finally, the hypothesized structural equation model was estimated. Beta coefficients were calculated to examine direct effects and Mackinnon’s asymmetric distribution of product test was used to evaluate mediated effects. Data analysis failed to confirm any of the study hypotheses; however, post-hoc analyses yielded findings that merit further study. Family functioning emerged as the heart of the model, embedded within a web of direct and mediated relationships. Additional findings suggest that family functioning mediates the effect of parents’ acculturation and of parents’ HIV knowledge on adolescent risk behaviors. Study limitations include its cross-sectional design, self-report measures, convenience sample and integration of clinical and non-clinical samples. Suggestions are provided for researchers to further explore relationships among the variables, and recommendations made for community nursing practitioners to develop, implement and evaluate HIV/STIs prevention programs for Hispanic adolescents.

The purpose of this descriptive cross-sectional study was to identify factors associated with disparities in self-rated health (SRH) among Asian and Hispanic immigrants. The acculturation theory and intersectionality framework were used to select predictors of SRH that included age, gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status, depressive symptoms, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, acculturation status, social position, and acculturative stress and discrimination events. A systematic review of the literature was completed and data from the 2009-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the 2002-2003 National Latino and Asian American Study were reviewed. This study found that acculturation status was associated with reporting disparities in SRH for both Asian and Hispanic immigrants. Limited English proficiency and being foreign-born was associated with worse SRH for Korean, Chinese, and Mexican immigrants, and in aggregate samples of Asian and Hispanic immigrants, compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Additionally, limited English proficiency was associated with worse SRH for Vietnamese immigrants. Among Mexican immigrants, higher levels of acculturation were associated with better SRH. Other key findings among Mexican immigrants were that depressive symptoms, increasing age, female gender, and elevated CRP were predictors of worse SRH compared to U.S.-born, non-Hispanic Whites. However, female gender and higher CRP were not predictors of worse SRH when level of acculturation was controlled for. For Chinese immigrants, acculturative stress was associated with worse SRH in an additive model while the interactions between social position and discrimination, and between gender, acculturative stress, and social position and education were predictive of worse SRH in multiplicative models. In summary, age, gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status, depressive symptoms, CRP, acculturation status, social position, and acculturative stress and discrimination were associated with disparities in SRH among two ethnic minorities in the U.S. These findings can be used to improve awareness and understanding of these immigrant populations who are vulnerable to poor health outcomes. Additionally, outcomes can assist in developing interventions to reduce the influence of social structures on health and to capture the true complexities of immigrants' lives.

We document the changing geography of immigrant settlement and review the emerging body of research in this area. We argue that examining immigrant assimilation in these new immigrant gateways is crucial for the development of theories about immigrant assimilation. We also argue that we are likely to see a protracted period of immigrant replenishment that may change the nature of assimilation.

Results indicated a significant main effect of maternal attachment on acculturation across time, as well an interaction in which the aforementioned link was blocked by adverse childhood experiences. In the context of acculturative learning, two tenets of the theory of epistemic trust were supported.

To what extent do Indian avatars' experiences of settlement in Second Life resemble the acculturation process experienced by Indian immigrants to the United States? Central themes discovered in the study were the complex issues faced by avatars in balancing traditional and modern Indian values, and the expansion of the Indian Diaspora in this environment to include non-Indian avatars richly enmeshed in Indian cultural and social life in Second Life.

In line with the Relative Extended Acculturation Model it also compares the outcomes of real (self-reported behavioral) and ideal (attitudinal) assessments of acculturation. Two hundred and eighty-nine first generation immigrants in New Zealand participated in the study. In line with the hypotheses, integration occurred more frequently when derived from cultural contact than from cultural adoption and when acculturation was framed in attitudinal, rather than behavioral, terms. The findings point to the necessity of clearly defining the dimensions of acculturation, ensuring they are appropriately operationalized, and differentiating attitudinal and self-reported behavioral measures. The consequences of the operationalization of acculturation for its relationship to adaptation are also reported and discussed.

The two groups of Haitian immigrant mothers were recruited from cities throughout the Northeast region of the United States. Using Harkness and Super's Developmental Niche as a theoretical guide, the researcher developed a qualitative interview protocol to assess the three components of this study's conceptualization of racial and ethnic socialization: (a) Haitian immigrant mothers' racial and ethnic messages and practices; (b) role the place in which the mothers were born and raised plays in their racial and ethnic socialization messages and practices; and (c) the factors that influence the mothers' racial and ethnic socialization messages and practices. Constructive grounded theory procedures were used to find themes and patterns of racial and ethnic socialization within the two groups of Haitian immigrant mothers and to identify similarities and differences among the two groups. The results from this study reveal that racial and ethnic socialization are processes of child development that are intricately related to the culture in which the family lives. Haitian immigrant mothers in Group A had similar racial socialization messages and practices to the Haitian immigrant mothers in Group B; however, the two groups differed greatly in their ethnic socialization messages and practices. Their messages and practices were influenced by the lessons they learned from their parents and the experiences that they had with race and ethnicity in Haiti and in the United States. In addition, being born and raised in Haiti and in the United States dictated the social contexts that Haitian immigrant mothers in Group A and Group B were exposed to, which shaped their understanding of and beliefs about race and ethnicity, their racial and ethnic identity, and the racial and ethnic identity they prescribed to their children.

In particular, I explore whether fluent bilingualism—proficiency in both minority home language and English—provides an adaptation advantage to the children of the post-1960 immigrants in terms of educational aspirations, expectations, college enrollment and graduation, compared to their English- monolingual or limited-bilingual peers. The results indicate that high school seniors from homes in which a second language is spoken prefer English over the parental language and that a shift to the dominant use of English by the third generation appears to be occurring. However, a quarter of those seniors maintain some proficiency in the minority home language. Proficiency rates vary by minority language group, but one in four youths from dual-language homes is fluently bilingual. Length of residence in the United States, measured as generational status, largely determines proficiency in minority home language, English and fluent bilingualism. Family social background and family structure are only weakly associated with language proficiency. However, family social background is a strong predictor of educational aspirations and attainment. Korean- and Vietnamese-speaking seniors not only report higher educational ambitions but also enroll in and graduate from a four-year college at higher rates than Spanish, Khmer- and Russian- speaking seniors. Spanish speakers appear to the most disadvantaged in terms of graduating from college Fluently bilingual youths hold higher educational aspirations and expectations than their English monolingual peers when family social background, family structure and generational status are controlled and are also more likely to attend a four-year college. However, fluent bilingualism does not provide an advantage in graduating from a four-year college.

Using a nation wide survey of 445 Chinese immigrants in November 2017, this study investigates the effects of cognitive barriers (i.e., acculturation levels) and affective obstacles (i.e., mental illness stigma) on Chinese immigrants' perceptual, attitudinal, and behavioral responses toward mental health services, by combing situational theory of problem solving and the theory of planned behavior. This study also examines the effects of mainstream and ethnic media use on acculturation and perceived stigma. Findings provide empirical support for the combined model, showing that all the cognitive and affective factors can predict Chinese immigrants' communicative action and behaviors regarding mental health services utilization. In addition, this study found that acculturation (cognitive barriers) is an effective predictor of individuals' ability to recognize the problem, connection to the problem, subjective norms regarding the problem, and their perceived behavioral control over the problem. On the other hand, mental illness stigma (affective barriers) can predict individuals' constraint recognition, attitudes, and perceived behavioral control over the issue. Practical implications are discussed for health public relations practitioners and communicators to better identify publics, propose strategic messages, and implement communication campaigns to improve Chinese immigrants' mental health services utilization rates.

This conceptual framework addresses the potential of groups with multiple social backgrounds to play a role in the facilitation of positive intergroup relations between their distinct social counterparts (e.g., immigrants as a gateway between home and host countries). Given their shared identity with different social groups, people with multiple identities can potentially bridge the cleft between the two otherwise separate groups with which they are affiliated. In this article, we first provide a theoretical introduction to the gateway group notion and review preliminary experimental and social network‐based research on gateway groups' potential to improve intergroup relations.

We studied two kinds of antecedents: majority members’ perceptions of Turkish minorities’ acculturation behavior and their experiences of intergroup contact. The possible mediating role of outgroup affect was also investigated. 247 Flemish high school students completed a survey. Data were analyzed using path analyses. Results show that positive contact experiences and perceiving that Turkish immigrants make efforts to engage in contact with the host group and/or to adopt the host culture are associated with less negative affective reactions towards Turkish migrants. Perceiving that Turkish immigrants maintain their heritage culture is associated with more negative affective reactions. Our results further revealed that increased negative affective reactions are associated with less support for culture maintenance and for contact with the host group but with a higher demand for host culture adoption. The present results also show that expectations of contact engagement and expectations of host culture adoption cannot be considered as equivalent. This implies that results from studies using Berry's conceptualization of acculturation expectations (Berry, 2001) and results from studies using Bourhis’ conceptualization of acculturation expectations (Bourhis, Moïse, Perreault, & Senécal, 1997) are not directly comparable. Our data also clearly disconfirm the orthogonal structure of the fourfold acculturation model for majority members’ acculturation expectations, suggesting that relying on the specific dimensions defining acculturation expectations may constitute a more valid approach to understand ongoing acculturation processes.

This may be due, in large part, to the lack of theory in commonly used methods to match programmatic content and delivery to the culture of a population, particularly at the deep structural level. This paper asserts that prior to the cultural adaptation of prevention programs, it is necessary to first develop a conceptual framework. We propose a multiphase approach to address key challenges in the science of cultural adaptation by first identifying and exploring relevant cultural factors that may affect the targeted health-related behavior prior to proceeding through steps of a stage model. The first phase involves developing an underlying conceptual framework that integrates cultural factors to ground this process. The second phase employs the different steps of a stage model. For Phase I of our approach, we offer four key steps and use our research study as an example of how these steps were applied to build a framework for the cultural adaptation of a family-based intervention to prevent adolescent alcohol use, Guiding Good Choices (GGC), to Chinese American families. We then provide a summary of the preliminary evidence from a few key relationships that were tested among our sample with the greater purpose of discussing how these findings might be used to culturally adapt GGC.

The framework employs five analytical steps: 1) preparation of an ‘international legal frame’ to underline ‘gender’ and ‘integration’ needs at workplaces, 2) preparation of a ‘national legal frame’ to examine if existing legislation incorporates identified ‘gender’ and ‘integration’ needs, 3) compilation of subjective experiences of women migrants relating to discriminatory practices at workplaces, 4) interpretation of expert's perspectives towards missing legal clauses and existing barriers to implementation, and 5) classification of legislation with respect to their gender- as well as integration-responsiveness. The findings reveal that the prevailing legislation do incorporate ‘gender’ to some extent, but neglect ‘integration’ to a large extent and thus offer partial protection to women migrants against discriminatory practices at workplaces. The Swedish legislation appear more gender- as well as integration-sensitive on selected needs than that of Germany. The inferences underline a dire need to conduct proper ‘gender’ as well as ‘integration’ analysis of relevant legislation to ensure smooth economic integration of women migrants in both countries.

The three featured articles in the December 2010 section on cultural diversity across the Pacific address important cultural issues in psychology. Berry (2010) applied these issues to intercultural relations and acculturation, Furnham (2010) to culture shock, and Marsella and Yamada (2010) to psychopathology. The common theme among these articles was the Western-centric dominance of psychology’s research, theories, models and practice, in part because of structural discrimination such as ethnocentric curricula, policies and teaching methods within academic institutions. In Aotearoa New Zealand, including mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge) and kaupapa Māori (Māori philosophy) within curricula for clinical psychology has started to address that Western-centric dominance, but more importantly, resulted in more culturally safe and responsive psychological services being provided to Māori users of those services. The present commentary suggested that including and integrating more cross-cultural and indigenous knowledge into the tertiary curricula of applied psychology fields, such as clinical, industrial-organisational, and coaching psychology would be one way to counter the Western-centric dominance.

The three articles in this special edition of the Journal of Pacific Rim Psychology encompass a range of approaches within cross-cultural psychology. Adrian Furnham’s (2011) culture shock shows how academic psychology can be applied to, and helps to inform a popular concept. John Berry’s (2011) acculturation theory demonstrates how focused theory and empirical data can align with a national agenda. Anthony J. Marsella and Ann Marie Yamada’s (2011) socioconstructionist critique of mainstream clinical psychology and psychiatric practices illustrate how epistemology and indigenous psychology can challenge institutional practices. They are united in rejecting a culture-blind psychology of the mainstream. They differ by referencing largely separate but nonetheless complementary literatures on cultures of relevance to the Pacific Rim region. Taken together, these three articles combine meaningfully to illustrate how Pacific Rim psychology might benefit from having (1) a definition of itself with Hawaii and the Pacific Island Nations as the centre and hub for the broader Pacific Rim that includes East Asia and the Western American seaboard; (2) a focus on action, particularly action research and its cyclical communication process of planning, action, evaluation and feedback; and (3) an interdisciplinary orientation where interconnectedness with such institutions as mass media, government, and clinical and psychiatric practices, as well as within psychology itself, underpin and inform research practice and policy.

This book attempts to meet this need by presenting an interdisciplinary, multidimensional theory, synthesizing the existing conceptualizations and empirical evidence in anthropology, communication, psychiatry, psychology, sociology, sociolinguistics, and related disciplines into a single theoretical scheme. The theory presented in this book is grounded in a systems perspective, based on which a set of assumptions, axioms, theorems, and a model are explicated. It emphasizes the stress-adapatation-growth dynamics of cross-cultural experiences, which bring about cultural strangers' gradual transformation toward increased functional fitness in the host milieu. Effective intrapersonal (cognitive, affective, and behavioural) and social (interpersonal and mass) communication activities are theorized as being at the heart of successful adaptation—along with individual background characteristics and host environmental conditions. The author concludes the book by outlining an integrative research design ideally suited for studying cross-cultural adaptation and by discussing practical implications of the theory for facilitating adaptation of cultural strangers and promoting integration of host societies.

Multicultural acquisition is positively correlated with both independent and interdependent self-construals, bilingual proficiency and usage, and dual cultural identifications. Multicultural acquisition is promotion-focused, while ethnic protection is prevention-focused and related to acculturative stress. Global orientations affect individuating and modest behavior over and above multicultural ideology, predict overlap with outgroups over and above political orientation, and predict psychological adaptation, sociocultural competence, tolerance, and attitudes toward ethnocultural groups over and above acculturation expectations/strategies. Global orientations also predict English and Chinese oral presentation performance in multilevel analyses and the frequency and pleasantness of intercultural contact in cross-lagged panel models. We discuss how the psychological study of global orientations contributes to theory and research on acculturation, cultural identity, and intergroup relations.

To fill this gap, the present research examines how key acculturation variables (e.g., strength of ethnic/host cultural identifications, bicultural identity integration or BII) relate to the composition and structure of bicultural individuals’ personal social networks. In Study 1, we relied on a generationally and culturally diverse community sample of 123 Latinos residing in the US. Participants nominated eight individuals (i.e., alters) from their habitual social networks and across two relational domains: friendships and colleagues. Results indicated that the interconnection of same ethnicity alters across different relationship domains is linked to cultural identifications, while the amount of coethnic and host individuals in the network is not. In particular, higher interconnection between Latino friends and colleagues was linked to lower levels of U.S. identification. Conversely, the interconnection of non-Latino friends and colleagues was associated with lower levels of Latino identification. This pattern of results suggests that the relational context for each type of cultural identification works in a subtractive and inverse manner. Further, time spent in the US was linked to both Latino and U.S. cultural identifications, but this relationship was moderated by the level of BII. Specifically, the association between time in the US and strength of both cultural identities was stronger for individuals reporting low levels of BII. Taking the findings from Study 1 as departure point, Study 2 used an agent-based model data simulation approach to explore the dynamic ways in which the content and the structure of an immigrant’s social network might matter over time in predicting three possible identity patterns: coexisting cultural identifications, conflicting cultural identifications, and a mixture of the two. These simulations allowed us to detect network constellations, which lead to identification or disidentification with both cultures. We showed that distinct patterns of social relations do not lead to identity outcomes in a deterministic fashion, but that often many different outcomes are probable.

Many intercultural communication studies deliberately place ethnic identity at the core of identity research to avoid using racial identity. Influenced by the difference-as-problem viewpoint, sojourners’ and immigrants’ Other-identities are often viewed as abnormal, deviant, and alien and therefore should be managed, reduced, and even eliminated. However, critical scholarship has revealed that the sense of being the Other is the main theme of sojourners and immigrants. Drawing upon postmodern, postcolonial, and hermeneutic approaches, sojourners’ and immigrants’ 3 types of Other-identities are conceptualized in this review, and their embeddedness in asymmetric power structures is explained. These ideas emerge from social categorization processes that use both phenotypic and cultural markers as primary categorizing criteria. Consequently, the view held by biculturalists is refuted, and elaboration is presented about the ways migrating individuals—in intercultural encounters—enrich their sense of Self through integrating their Other-identities into their Self-identities, producing fused identities.

It also follows a multiperspective approach, as it examines the attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors not only of immigrants but also of the members of the majority society (primarily, but not solely, as perceived by the immigrant student). We first present an overview of the model and background literature that informed this conceptual approach. Next, we delineate this approach at two levels: the school level and the classroom level. We discuss multiple perspectives, examining how immigrants and nationals perceive the acculturative school context, and explore possible discrepancies between these attitudes and perceptions.

These challenges, such as language barriers, racial discrimination, underemployment, the loss of support networks, and changes in family role and structure, may exacerbate myriad mental health issues. In addition, their help-seeking behavior, as shaped by a general adherence to a collectivistic woridview and indirect communication style, often creates challenges for the practitioners who arc trained under a Western practice modality. Drawing on literature from English-speaking countries with sizable Asian immigrant populations such as the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United Kingdom, this text is designed especially for clinicians and students working with Asian immigrant populations. It discusses the therapeutic process in psychotherapy and counseling with these clients, exploring both key psychodynamic constructs and social systemic factors. Building on contemporary relational theory, which emphasizes the centrality of the helping relationship and sensitivity to the client's subjective realities, the book demonstrates how Western-based concepts and skills can be broadened and applied in an Asiacentric context, and can be therapeutic even in social service and case management service settings. There are chapters on issues such as domestic violence, intergenerational conflicts, depression amongst elders, and suicide, discussing the prevalence and nature of the mental health issues and each containing case vignettes from various Asian ethnic groups to illustrate the application of relational approaches. This book is an important cross-cultural reference for practicing social workers and counselors as well as for social work students undertaking clinical practice courses.

They show how evolutionary stability may change because of differences in initial conditions, whereas previous work on cultural evolution has focused only on how a particular culture might spread. The authors use the cultural assimilation of immigrants as the narrative for exposition. Specifically they look at the interaction between immigrants with an independent self-construct and immigrants with an interdependent self-construct in 2 settings—in a society that is predominantly collectivistic and in a society that is predominantly individualistic. Immigrants, whether with an independent self-construct or with an interdependent self-construct, can also be entity theorists (i.e., fixed mindset) or incremental theorists (i.e., growth mindset) about the self in relation to others. The authors use evolutionary game theory to model how the host country cultural environment places selective pressure on the cultures of immigrant populations, which, in turn, influences how well immigrants assimilate into their host country. Their results lead to 5 testable hypotheses: (a) depending on the initial ratio of immigrants with an independent self-construct and immigrants with an interdependent self-construct, assimilation is either complete or nonexistent in collectivistic societies; (b) in individualistic societies assimilation is never complete; (c) the lower the cost of coordination for immigrants with an interdependent self-construct, the easier it becomes for both immigrants with an independent self-construct and immigrants with an interdependent self-construct to assimilate into collectivistic societies; (d) the lower the cost of coordination for immigrants with an interdependent self-construct, the harder it becomes for both immigrants with an independent self-construct and immigrants with an interdependent self-construct to assimilate into individualistic societies; and (e) entity theorists are more likely to have an assimilation advantage in individualistic societies. In sum, our modeling approach offers a new framework for the understanding of the dynamic link between psychology and cultural evolution. These changes are testable in a way that merely identifying pathways to evolutionary stability are not.

Some cultural arguments problematically define certain ethno-racial identities and cultures as subtractive from the goal of academic mobility while defining the ethnic cultures and identities of others as additive and oriented toward this goal. We review two prevailing schools of thought that compare immigrant and native minority students: cultural–ecological theory and segmented assimilation theory. Second, we examine empirical research that highlights the complexity of culture, focusing on four domains: (a) the school’s cultural environment; (b) variation in identities and cultural practices within ethnic and racial groups; (c) the multidimensional nature of culture and its variable impact on students; and (d) the intersections of race, ethnicity, class, and gender. This literature—when synthesized—suggests that a coherent theory of culture’s impact on ethnic and racial differences in schooling outcomes must unpack the multiple influences of identity and context more deliberately than previous literature has done. Finally, we call for studies that employ comparative research across groups and understand race and ethnicity contextually, not as mere dummy variables, thereby equipping researchers with the tools to better explain how culture influences schooling and achievement.

Early theorists described values as the cultural heritage, passed from one generation to the next, that allows individuals to function efficiently in their social environment and to preserve the structure of society (Mannheim, 1952; Mead, 1934). Cross-cultural studies of intergenerational value transmission are few in number, however. This chapter addresses some of the core issues relevant to the study of value transmission across cultures. We focus on the interplay of culture, migration, and parenting style as they relate to socialization processes. We first propose two different processes through which parenting style and culture may affect value socialization. We then consider the role of parenting style in diverse cultures, focusing on Russian-immigrant and veteran-Israeli youth. Then we examine acculturation attitudes and acculturation contexts as they relate to value socialization in immigrant families. Finally, we briefly discuss implications of the findings for cross-cultural studies of value socialization. This chapter asked how culture and migration affect cultural transmission. Two studies investigated this question, using Russian immigrants in Israel as an exemplary cultural group. This is one of the first attempts to study value transmission with a focus on cross-cultural issues. The data on love withdrawal and its relationship with controlled versus autonomous acceptance of perceived parental values supported the view that culture--through its expression in such cultural practices as parenting styles--affects the transmission process. The studies also demonstrated the role of adolescents' acculturation attitudes and of the acculturation context provided by the school in cultural transmission. Both studies further illustrated the importance of the appropriateness of parenting practices to particular cultures and contexts as an influence on cultural transmission. Cross-cultural studies provide a unique opportunity to study cultural transmission from a comparative perspective. The findings of these studies present a complex picture in which the influence of parents on their children depends on parents' own characteristics, on the characteristics of the children, and on cultural and situational factors. We have also identified additional sources of complexity that make the cross-cultural study of cultural transmission especially challenging. There is much yet to do to unravel the influences of parental values, parenting behavior, family relationships, and cultural context in the process of cultural transmission.

Thus far, the focus has been on developing appropriate tests and norms to obtain accurate testing data. By contrast, far less attention has been paid to the contextual impact of culture on an evaluation. This paper attempts to address this shortcoming. Methods: This manuscript introduces the ECLECTIC framework for conceptualizing different facets of culture pertinent for understanding a culturally diverse client when conducting a neuropsychological evaluation. Individual components of the framework (E: education and literacy; C: culture and acculturation; L: language; E: economics; C: communication; T: testing situation: comfort and motivation; I: intelligence conceptualization; and C: context of immigration) are introduced and potential biases to fairness in testing are described. In this manner, the framework specifies how individual facets of culture can impact neuropsychological test performance. Conclusions: Clinical implementation of the framework will be illustrated with a case sample. Strengths and weaknesses of the framework are discussed as well as recommendations for implementation.

However, US evidence suggests that this initial health advantage erodes over time, a process referred to as 'unhealthy assimilation,' the 'acculturation paradox,' or the 'immigrant paradox.' Variation in terminology reflects divergence in the conceptual frameworks researchers have used to approach the study of immigrant health, and in particular, how adaptation to US culture and environment influences health. The goal of this chapter is to summarize the evidence on studies that examine these questions in US immigrants with regard to chronic disease risk, in particular obesity, diabetes, and physical activity. A theoretical framework is proposed that can guide interpretation of findings on studies of chronic disease risk in US immigrants and inform future studies that aim to examine the influence of migration on health from a global perspective.

The identity-mobilization framework is intended as a set of hypotheses to stimulate dialogue as well as empirical research on these issues. Following a brief note on diasporas and the potential security risks they pose, the article proceeds in three sections: the first section discusses diaspora identity, why it matters, and factors that influence its construction; the second considers why diaspora identity construction holds a potential for conflict; and the third addresses diaspora mobilization, and develops the identity-mobilization framework. The framework brings together identity construction strategies, locus of identity, and resulting acculturation strategies and potential contributions. The article closes with policy implications.

This article contributes a quantitative assessment of cannabis normalization as differentiated by social location predictors. Methods: Logistic and zero-inflated negative binomial regression models assess three areas of cannabis normalization: accessibility, acceptability, and recent use. Peer network cannabis use prevalence, gender, nativity, campus locale and living arrangement are explored as focal predictors of variation in normalization among 1,713 cannabis using and nonusing undergraduate students in Canada. Results: Women report lower odds of positive cannabis acceptability attitudes. While women report lower rates of recent cannabis use, gender is not a significant predictor for lifetime prevalence. Being a recent immigrant significantly predicts lower recent use, lower odds of favorable attitudes to cannabis, and reduced accessibility in comparison to students born in Canada. Longer-term immigrants do not show significant differences from students born in Canada on accessibility and acceptability, suggesting a substance use acculturation effect. Lower peer cannabis use prevalence exhibits a protective effect against use. In comparison to students who report that 'some' of their peer network uses cannabis, those with 'all' users in their network exhibit lower acceptability attitudes. This suggests a threshold relationship between peer use prevalence and acceptability. Conclusions/Importance: This article provides a data point for assessing future shifts in cannabis normalization prior to impending changes in Canadian drug policy that will legalize recreational cannabis use. Results show that normalization components of recent use, acceptability, and accessibility are differentiated by gender, nativity, and peer network cannabis use prevalence.

Most interpretations of these health patterns by duration of U.S. residence rely on theories of immigrant integration; they posit that with increasing time in the United States, immigrants incorporate economically, socially, and culturally into aspects of U.S. society, and that these changes impact health. Few studies empirically examine whether these aspects of integration are indeed mediators of the association between duration of U.S. stay and BMI, and if their patterns differ across immigrant subgroups. This study examines data from the National Latino and Asian American Survey, using path analytic methods to simultaneously test six hypothesized mediators between duration and BMI: household income, English language ability, ethnic identity, family cohesion, acculturative stress and discrimination for both Latino and Asian immigrants, stratified by gender. We find little evidence for an association between duration and BMI for either Latino or Asian men. For women, duration and BMI have a significant and positive relationship, although the pathways differ between the two ethnic groups. For Latina women, household income and acculturative stress are significant indirect pathways, although they work in opposing directions. For Asian women, English proficiency and discrimination are significant indirect pathways. Our findings reveal complex pathways between duration and BMI that vary by ethnicity and gender and highlight limitations in the negative acculturation theory, which suggests that exposure to the United States should have a net negative impact on health. In contrast, our findings suggest that not all groups show declining health with longer duration, as measured by BMI, and that integration processes do not always translate into health differences in the expected directions. Future research on duration patterns may need to consider alternative explanations beyond incorporation-based processes, such as cross-national health theories or age, period, cohort effects.

The intervention design and assessment were guided by the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT). The intervention was evaluated through a randomized controlled trial with 6-month and 12-month follow-ups. The primary behavioral outcome was the use of condoms. Other outcome measures include HIV knowledge, condom use knowledge, HIV-related perceptions (PMT constructs), and intention to use condom. The mixed-effects regression models for condom use with regular partners indicated that overall frequency of condom use, condom use in last three sexual acts and proper condom use increased over time for the participants but the increases were significantly greater among the intervention group than the control group at 6-month and 12-month follow-ups. The mixed-effects models for HIV-related perceptions indicated that extrinsic rewards, intrinsic rewards, and response costs decreased while vulnerability, severity, response efficacy, and self-efficacy increased over time for the intervention group. The increases in HIV knowledge, condom use knowledge, and intention to use condom were also significantly greater among the intervention group than the control group. The data in the current study suggested efficacy of a social cognitive theory-based behavioral intervention in increasing condom use among young migrants in China. The intervention also increased protective perceptions and decreased risk perception posited by the theory (i.e., PMT).

This model combines approaches of acculturation and socialization research. Intrapersonal (cyclic interplay of information, uncertainty reduction and learning) and interpersonal (voice, participation, empowerment and social support) coping-processes lead to successful adaptation of work migrants. In turn, successful adaptation has positive effects on further work-related outcomes. The model takes account of the fact that due to the additional challenge of having to adapt to a new culture, organizational socialization of work migrants proceeds in a more complex fashion. The model provides starting points for future research and practical applications.

Analysis of processes of development, maintenance and redefinition of identity in contexts of alternative cultural norms contends with the assumption of conscious choice or strategy towards mainstream and heritage cultures. From the perspective of identity issues, enculturation of cultural elements rather than acculturation is often the more significant process. Going beyond critique to consider issues of the persistence of ethnic identity and processes of cultural reformulation, brings attention to the origins of primordialist sentiment within ethnic identity and the possibilities for generating situationalist perspectives. Reference to empirical investigations using Identity Structure Analysis (introduced as a conceptual framework for explicating complex identity processes) provides evidence for different identity processes and structures according to socio-historical context and the greater malleability of situationalists compared with primordialists in their empathetic identifications with alternative cultural groups.

The article provides a test of those arguments in the area of school performance. Based on data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study, indicators of community-based social capital are shown to account for considerable interethnic differences in school performance. The results challenge notions that ethnic communities are generally supportive of the second generation’s school performance, while contact with oppositional cultures of domestic minorities is the main cause of lower than average achievement. They support a conditional view of ethnic communities: the extent to which immigrant families’ insertion into ethnic communities can support the school performance of their children depends on the communities’ socioeconomic profile and level of aspirations.

The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between the acculturation, ethnic socialization practices, and transnationalism of Mexican immigrant mothers (N = 60) living in Chicago. Using hierarchical linear regression analysis, different dimensions of acculturation and transnationalism were tested as predictors of ethnic socialization practices (i.e., cultural socialization, preparation for bias, use of cultural resources), controlling for demographic variables. The construct of transnationalism was composed of two dimensions: transnational network and transnational practices, and conceptualized as the degree of orientation or connectedness to family, friends, or community in immigrants’ nation of origin. In addition to testing transnational network and practices as predictors of ethnic socialization, they were also tested as moderators of the relationship between the dimensions of acculturation and dimensions of ethnic socialization. Results indicated that Mexican and American acculturation dimensions significantly predicted preparation for bias. Also, a larger transnational network and more transnational practices predicted more preparation for bias and use of cultural resources. Both transnational dimensions also moderated the relationship between Mexican and American acculturation dimensions with preparation for bias and use of cultural resources. The findings are discussed in terms of expanding our understanding of acculturation and ethnic socialization by addressing the transnational context of Mexican immigrant families.

We examined (a) how mothers’ acculturation and enculturation were related to mainstream (i.e., authoritarian vs. authoritative styles, communication, warmth/bonding, autonomy support) versus culture specific parenting practices (i.e., interdependence, commitment to education, academic control) and (b) how parenting practices were, in turn, linked to youth outcomes of depression, antisocial behaviors, and academic performance as measured 1.5 years later. Mothers and youth had significant perceptual gaps in parenting practices, especially in autonomy support and parental commitment to education. Therefore, path analyses were conducted separately for mother-reported versus youth-reported parenting. As hypothesized, mothers’ acculturation was more closely related to mainstream parenting, while enculturation was to culture specific parenting. Mother-reported autonomy support predicted higher academic performance, while youth-reported authoritarian parenting predicted lower academic performance. Youth-reported communication predicted lower depression and antisocial behaviors. The current findings have implications for parenting and family interventions to optimize Korean immigrant youth’s well-being in the bicultural context. Additionally, bilinear acculturation was found to be a useful conceptual framework in studying immigrant parenting.

Phenomenological interviews with voluntary migrants, individuals who choose to leave their homeland to become foreigners in a new culture, reveal consistently deep themes and motivations which could convincingly be labelled 'existential'. Rather than migrating in search of employment, career advancement, or overall improved economic conditions, these voluntary migrants are seeking greater possibilities for self-actualising, exploring foreign cultures in order to assess their own identity, and ultimately grappling with issues of home and belonging in the world generally. The article offers a sketch of this phenomenon with reference to Martin Heidegger's ontology, thereby indicating alternative understandings of 'home', 'not-being-at-home', 'belonging', which take into account the narratives of these migratory experiences. An example of the conceptual ramifications of this new understanding of voluntary migration is found in the definition of 'home as interaction' rather than the usual 'home as place'. The article offers a cautionary note regarding the potentially profound and mostly ignored psychological consequences of the contemporary push to increasing globalisation. As a summary article, what follows will potentially raise more questions than answers for the reader; further articles will be forthcoming and feedback is welcome.

The present study examined the generalizability of acculturation models and the adaptiveness of acculturation strategies in another bicultural environment--a colonial setting. The sample included 138 girls (M = 13.8 years) and their parents from Hong Kong, a former British colony. Results verified that both Chinese and western acculturation occurred on individual psychological levels and that the bidimensional model was a suitable acculturation framework. Using hierarchical multiple regression, results suggested that acculturation towards Chinese (majority) culture was related to better adaptation in terms of higher academic achievement and positive family dynamics (parental nurturance and closer family relationships). Acculturation towards western (minority) culture was related to poorer adaptation in terms of engaging in greater misconduct and negative family interactions (larger intergenerational value discrepancies and family conflicts). Thus, acculturation towards the majority culture held adaptive implications, whereas acculturation towards the minority culture held maladaptive implications. Consideration of the bicultural composition (e.g., status, prestige, strength of cultural networks of each culture) should be incorporated into acculturation theory to better understand adjustment implications across a wide range of contexts.

A critical ethnography served to challenge assumptions regarding successful integration embedded within government documents and to raise awareness of the challenges faced by French-speaking immigrants from visible minority groups residing within London, Ontario, Canada. A theoretical framework applying Goffman's concept of performance and Bourdieu's concepts of field, habitus, and capital guided the stud/. Eight migrants participated in up to five sessions including narrative and in-depth interviews, Occupational Mapping, and participation in occupations. Findings highlight that integration involves a process of 'starting over,' which entails becoming aware of differences in fields and habitus within and between home and host societies, learning 'how things work' in the host community, and negotiating performances in social interactions. This negotiation, enacted primarily through occupation, is influenced by differential access to forms of capital. It is further related to ways immigrants' intersecting identity markers are constructed within particular places and embedded in broader social systems and structures. These findings challenge the linear and individualized process of integration identified within government documents, and the narrow focus on economic productivity as the occupation-based marker of integration.

Conversely, cultural retention typically reduces such behavior. To explain these findings, this study employs differential coercion and support theory to predict that cultural retention is inversely associated with delinquency through associations with greater social support and less coercion. Method: Using a large, national‐level sample of Latino native‐born and immigrant youth, analyses are conducted using both ordinary least squares (OLS) and logistic regression. Results: Findings support hypotheses, showing that increases in cultural retention are associated with less coercion and more social support, both of which are, in turn, related to delinquency. Importantly, an initial strong inverse relationship between cultural retention and delinquency disappears when coercion and social support are controlled. Conclusion: Higher social support and lower coercion help explain the inverse relationship between cultural retention and delinquency among native‐born and immigrant Latino youth.

Because the social world is constituted by the broader cultural milieu in which an individual and groups of individuals reside, silencing the self theory can be a powerful tool in examining the interface between self and culture. The theory can further be used to explore the process of transitioning from one culture to another, a process embodied in the immigrant experience. In this chapter, I describe the role of self-silencing in a particular type of immigrant experience: that of women who have emigrated from the English-speaking Caribbean to Canada or the United States. The basis for this discussion is a series of focus groups that were conducted in Toronto and New York City in which Caribbean immigrant women talked about the idea of self-silencing within the context of their lives as immigrant women. Through a comparison of the focus group findings from the Canadian immigrant sample and the American immigrant sample, it is possible to detect phenomenological differences in the role that self-silencing plays in adapting to the cultural context in the United States in contrast to the cultural adaptation described by the immigrant women in Canada.

High income countries show an elevated rate of physical inactivity among children. Low- and middle-income countries are beginning to experience a gradual increase in this trend. Canada is a highly industrialized multicultural society with nearly 22% of foreign-born individuals coming through the immigration process. Recent immigrants tend to experience a decline in their health status, over time as their years in Canada increase (negative acculturation effect). This phenomenon can be attributed to several factors including adaptation to the new sociocultural environment. While a great deal of research has focused on children, there is paucity of research in this area among West African children in Canada. With Saskatchewan being one of the fastest growing populations in Canada, this study sought to gain a deeper understanding of the perspectives of West African immigrant families in Saskatchewan and assess the impact of the sociocultural environment on active living among their adolescent children. Using purposive sampling, a total of 15 families residing in Saskatchewan were interviewed. Children between 10 to 17 years and their parents were interviewed in each family. A grounded theory methodological approach by Charmaz (2014) was used in this study. This involved an immersion phase, a conceptual phase, and a constant comparative analytical process. The analysis allowed for emergence of themes. Both the children and their parents reported having experiential knowledge of physical activity and benefits. The children and their parents also showed some negative acculturative experiences associated with active living. They reported facilitators of physical activity for the children such as school influence, peer influence, and parental role-modelling. The children showed an inherent interest in engaging in risky play. Both the children and their parents reported beneficial outcomes of engaging in physical activity together as a family. Finally, parental positive and negative reinforcements was reported in relation to domestic activities. This study contributes to a conceptual understanding of the knowledge regarding internal, external, and transitional factors impacting the active living and well-being of West African children in Canada.

This critical theory study used a focus group and follow-up individual interviews to illuminate how five adult bicultural Koreans residing in the U.S. negotiate their sociocultural identities within the context of U.S. imperialist influences. Interpretive phenomenological analysis (Smith & Osborn, 2008) and methods drawn from feminist research (Anderson & Jack, 1991) were employed to analyze the data. The analysis of the focus group and individual interviews suggested that participants were influenced by their experiences of immigration, racialization, racism, and racial triangulation in the U.S. Moreover, participants' accounts manifested hegemonic ideologies of color-blindness and individualism, and revealed a mixture of false consciousness and critical consciousness about racism within the U.S. That is, colorblind ideology and individualistic ideology appeared to obscure the role of racialization and racism, resulting in a false consciousness. At the same time, participants also manifested a critical understanding of history and the call for sociopolitical activism. Additionally, participants' narratives revealed internalized beliefs about the superiority of the U.S. versus the inferiority of Korea. Although most participants explicitly denied the impact of these factors on their bicultural identity, they implicitly acknowledged ways in which the asymmetrical power dynamics between the U.S. and Korea on the global stage, and between White Americans and ethnic Koreans within the U.S., influence their negotiation of sociocultural identities. The present findings have theoretical and practical implications for understanding and working with bicultural Koreans within the U.S. First, identity theory and clinical practice associated with bicultural Koreans needs to attend to the experiences of loss of power, racism, and assimilation. Second, it is important to attend to the role of ideologies in bicultural Koreans' identity negotiation. Third, there needs to be a focus on the influence of false consciousness in bicultural Koreans' identities. Finally, because bicultural Koreans' internalization of the inferiority of Korean culture appears to influence their identities as Korean and American, this internalization should be attended to theorizing about and counseling with bicultural Koreans.

The AIM applies the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991) to the case of immigration. In the present study, the AIM was assessed among high-school adolescents who immigrated from Russia and Ukraine to Israel as part of an educational program (n = 151). The adolescents completed questionnaires twice: half a year before and three years after their immigration. In accordance with the theoretical model, attitudes towards the country of origin and the host country and perceived environmental constraints (including perceived discrimination as well as perceived social support from parents, peers, and teachers) affected the immigrants’ acculturation intentions. In contrast with what was hypothesized in this study, immigrants’ psychological resources were not related to their acculturation intentions.

This pattern reflects the long-standing socio-political history between the U.S. and Mexico and is well-documented in the sociological literature along with discussion of transnational context. Despite data to suggest that serial migration separations increase risk for depression for both parents and children when compared to non-separated immigrant counterparts, few studies have specifically investigated the effects of these separations on individual-level and family-level outcomes. This study uses an acculturative stress model to examine the effects of serial-migration family separations on parent depression, family cohesion and general family functioning. Part of this study also served as a pilot phase for developing a measure to assess parents' appraisals of family separation and reunion experiences. Data were collected from a community sample of Mexican immigrant parents (N=53; 72% mothers) via surveys administered in Spanish by researchers. Seventy percent of the sample experienced a separation from at least one child during immigration to the U.S. A relatively high percentage (43.4%) met clinical cutoff scores for depression, but there was no significant difference in scores between separated status and non-separated status groups. These groups also did not differ on any family-level outcomes. Even though results did not support the proposed mediation models to predict depression or family-level outcomes, separated status parents reported significantly higher levels of acculturative stress than their non-separated counterparts. Pilot data suggest that negative appraisals of separation experiences were associated with higher levels of acculturative stress and depression, as well as poor family functioning and family cohesion. Overall, these findings endorse using an acculturative stress framework to understand the post-migration experiences of Mexican families in the U.S. Limitations of these findings are discussed along with suggestions for future research.

While many transition theories contribute to our understanding of how parents’ experience change over time, many traditional transition models are not family-centered and do not provide a strengths-based perspective of parents’ experiences during this transition. This paper describes the process of theory derivation to develop a strengths-based theory of parental transformation (STPT). We used the theory of well-being of refugee women experiencing cultural transition to gain insights into parents’ experiences related to their child’s diagnosis. We propose that the STPT addresses a gap in the literature by situating the diagnostic process within a strengths’ based framework that aligns with contemporary perspectives regarding disability. The STPT emphasizes understanding parents’ experiences and needs in ways that promote personal growth to support the parent and child.

The last 15 years have seen a growth in research demonstrating increased rates of psychosis in migrant populations around the world, and in derivative literature exploring etiological hypotheses that might explain this disparity. The current study notes an absence in this literature of acknowledgement of the central role that culture, language, and transitional states play in both immigration and psychosis, which hampers a full and clinically useful understanding of what happens when these processes co-occur. To augment the literature, the author surveys topics such as anthropology's revisions to the concept of acculturation, postcolonial theories of cultural encounter and evolution, poststructuralist theories of language and meaning, and deconstructionist analysis of xenophobia's influence in the historical development of psychosis as a diagnosis, applying these to a more nuanced appreciation of the convergence of migration and psychosis. The review concludes explaining how interdisciplinary perspectives might play a larger role in guiding clinical research and training, and might allow for ways of thinking about psychosis that both improve patient care and help propel academic discourse on language, culture, meaning, and psychosis, the great conundrums of psychiatry and philosophy.

The existential state of migration leads to the formation of multiple, diasporic identities, deterritorialized and recompiled at the individual level. The inclusion of immigrants is therefore the result of two-way processes in which the social representations that migrants construct of the population and of the host society (before and after their arrival), and the intangible resources that they experience are of paramount importance. Integration is 'an evolutionary process,' and integration policies need to be elaborated according to a logic that supports access to services, language learning, and the fight against discrimination. On this latter aspect, a strongly discriminating variable is gender and sexuality linked to it: theoretical and methodological challenges suggest the intersecting of a perspective that takes into account the interconnection of gender, sexuality, and migration.

Segmented assimilation theory posits that the outcomes of immigrants will not necessarily improve monotonically across generations, especially in disadvantaged contexts, and that maintaining familial and ethnic ties can have a protective effect on immigrant students. The author tests these ideas by examining variation in the generational pattern of achievement in low-income schools among Latino high school students. The author finds that changes in achievement across generations generally follow a pattern of classical assimilation with small, though not statistically significant, improvements in achievement from the first to the second generation and from the second to the third generation in both poor and nonpoor schools. Contrary to hypotheses derived from segmented assimilation theory, the author finds no evidence of 'downward assimilation' across generations among Latinos attending low-income schools.

Participants were presented with a fictitious interview with an African immigrant whose generational Status, desire for Culture Maintenance and Intercultural Contact (Study 1) or host Culture Adoption (Study 2) were manipulated (2 × 2 × 2 design). Results showed that both perceived desire for contact and for culture adoption positively affected host members’ attitudes, and that the culture adoption–attitudes relationship was partially mediated by perceived threat. These effects were stronger than those attributable to perceived Culture Maintenance. The latter variable moderated the Desire for Contact but not the Desire for Culture Adoption main effect. Moreover, Contact and Culture Adoption and generational Status all influenced the way in which host members perceived immigrants’ sociocultural adjustment. We conclude that more similarities than differences exist between the Contact and the Culture Adoption frameworks, at least in terms of their effects on majority attitudes towards immigrants.

Today's migration contexts differ significantly from those of the past. Moving within a globalized world impacts processes of risk and resilience in families. The changes imposed by migration on family processes deserve our careful study to inform better delivery of social, medical, and educational services attuned to the special needs of immigrants. Concepts from family systems theory and family therapy, supplemented with concepts from studies on migration, can be used to deepen our understanding of the family transformations brought about by migration. This chapter expands on the author's earlier writings about the dilemmas of personal, family, and social transformation faced by immigrants and their capacity to find 'both/and' solutions rather than forcing 'either/or' choices regarding cultural change (Falicov, 1998a, 2002). The chapter discusses the multidimensional, ecosystemic, comparative approach model (MECA) for understanding the experiences of migration and acculturation, the changed ecological context, and issues related to the family life cycle and family organization. It also explores variations in the experience of migration and acculturation; the loss, grief, and mourning that are characteristic of the migration experience; the impact of racism and anti-immigrant reception; and, how to successfully integrate the dual visions of continuity and change. Finally, the author discusses the emergence of resilient immigrant practices that she labels 'spontaneous rituals,' because they encapsulate in ritualized ways various family, social, and cultural restitutive attempts following migration. In addition, the author addresses situations in which migration risks test families' capacity for blending continuity and change, and may result in clinical symptoms.

By contrast, this study develops and tests a theory of imported socialization in an effort to understand how immigrants’ political socialization experiences before they left their countries of origin shape the way they view the new polity after migration; the extent to which this imported socialization affects their degree of post-migration political engagement; and finally for how long the content of immigrants’ political suitcases remains consequential during their civic lives in their new home.

Methods: Survey of the historical development of assimilation theory and its successors and systematic comparison of key concepts in aging and immigrant incorporation theories. Results: Studies of immigrants, as well as of the life course, trace their origins to the Chicago School at the turn of the 20th century. Today, both theoretical perspectives emphasize adaptation as a time-dependent, multidimensional, nonlinear, and multidirectional process. Immigrant incorporation theories have not fully engaged with a key concern of aging theory—why there are age differences. Insights from cognitive aging and developmental biology, life-span developmental psychology, and age stratification and the life course suggest explanations for age differences in the speed of immigrant incorporation. Discussion: Theories of adaptation to aging and theories of immigrant incorporation developed so independently that they neglected the subject they have in common, namely, older immigrants. Because they address similar conceptual problems and share key assumptions, a productive dialogue between two vibrant fields is long overdue.

Their work provides an initial roadmap for linking the cultural perspectives often taken in the study of ethnicity to the structural perspectives utilized in the study of race. The authors put these perspectives in dialogue with one another to elucidate the strength of integrating commonly used approaches in each area, while avoiding the pitfalls of relying only on one paradigm. Behind much of sociology’s theoretical developments to understand racial and ethnic groups’ experiences in US society, and in relation to global discussions of race and ethnicity as well, are influences of identity and ideological processes inflected and reflected by whiteness. This comment reflects on how these processes can shape future conversations considering the intertwined cultural and structural processes framing group experiences and life chances.

Prior research has shown that PWID who started injecting drugs in Puerto Rico (P.R.) tend to maintain the risky injection behaviors learned there. This study identifies the P.R.-native norms supporting the continued injection risk behavior of migrant Puerto Rican PWID in NYC to inform a culturally appropriate risk-reduction intervention. Methods: 40 migrant Puerto Rican PWID were recruited in NYC for a longitudinal qualitative study. The sample was stratified to include 20 migrants with <3 years in NYC and 20 migrants with >3-6 years in NYC. Time-location sampling was used to curb possible network bias in recruitment. Over 12 months, migrants completed semi-structured interviews at baseline, monthly follow-ups, and study exit. Analyses were guided by grounded theory. Results: Most participants (90%) reported having had chronic HCV, and 22.5% reported being HIV-positive. Syringe- and cooker-/cotton-sharing were widespread in both P.R. and NYC. The ubiquitous practice of cleaning used syringes by 'water-rinsing and air-blowing' was guided by a normative belief, learned in P.R., that 'water and air kill HIV.' Sterile syringe use was not a priority. HCV was not a concern. P.R.-native abstinence-only narratives discouraged opioid agonist treatment (OAT) enrollment among recent migrants (≤3 years). Experiences with drug dealers, prison-power groups, and injection doctors ('Gancheros') in P.R. influenced migrants’ injection risk behavior in NYC. Those who were Gancheros in P.R. continued working as Gancheros in NYC. Conclusions: Injection risks make migrant Puerto Rican PWID in NYC vulnerable to HIV/HCV. Harm reduction programs should pay closer attention to the rationales behind these injection risks. A risk-reduction intervention that incorporates the Ganchero figure may be a credible way to help migrants reduce injection risk and accept OAT and syringe exchange programs (SEP).

This line of inquiry is often approached as a 'specialty' topic involving a discrete de-contextualized population, rather than a topic that is central for understanding patterns of population health within and between sending and receiving countries. Frequently immigrant health research employs theoretical frameworks (e.g., acculturation) that emphasize cultural explanations, while less commonly utilized is the 'social determinants of health' framework, which emphasizes social and structural explanations. Drawing upon literature in the fields of economics, sociology of immigration, and social epidemiology, we present a conceptual framework for understanding immigrant health from a cross-national perspective. We discuss the theoretical foundations of this framework; the methodological challenges for undertaking research on immigration and health using this framework; examples of emerging research in this area; and directions for future research. Progress in immigrant health research and population health improvements can be achieved through an enhanced understanding of population health patterns in sending and receiving societies. Immigrant health research needs to be better integrated into social epidemiology. Concurrently, immigrant health research offers conceptual, empirical, and analytic opportunities to advance social epidemiological research. Together, scholarship in immigrant health and social epidemiology can make significant contributions toward one of their mutual and ultimate goals: to improve knowledge about population health.

Prior to beginning his work at a local school district, a consultant reads that collectivism, spirituality, and interdependence are salient values of the majority culture in this particular district. A practitioner attends a conference seminar that highlights the role of acculturation theory (Kohatsu, this Handbook, Volume One; Padilla, 1980) in working with immigrant communities. Although each scenario is seemingly different, a common question binds each of these individuals. That is, how does one bridge the gap between racial-cultural counseling theory (RCT) and racial-cultural practice? At an abstract level, racial-cultural information and theories of racial-cultural counseling per se may be relatively straightforward to comprehend conceptually. Nevertheless, both practitioners and practitioners in training continue to struggle with questions of how theories of racial-cultural counseling (e.g., racial identity, acculturation), as well as their understanding of the values, beliefs, and history of a given community, can facilitate their ability to deliver culturally competent services. While the need to link RCT to practice is intuitively understandable, the framework for doing so remains surprisingly absent in the literature. Indeed, given the attention that has been devoted to developing standards of cross-cultural competence (American Psychological Association, 2003; Ponterotto & Austin, this Handbook, this volume; D. Sue, Arredondo, & McDavis, 1992; D. Sue & Torino, this Handbook, this volume), as well as developing training models (Pedersen, 1977b; A. Reynolds, 1997), training exercises (Katz, 1978; Singelis, 1998), curriculum designs (Adams, Bell, & Griffin, 1997; Carter, this Handbook, this volume; A. Reynolds, 1995), and so forth, the absence of a framework for linking RCT to practice is particularly striking. The absence of a framework seems to be due in large part to the fact that, in general, race and culture have not been included as factors in theories of counseling. Instead, they are often presented as an addendum to the psychological canon, rather than as an integral part of it. Nevertheless, in a profession that has actively strived to promote cross-cultural competence as a requisite professional foundation (D. Sue et al., 1992), logic suggests that a framework is needed to assist practitioners in utilizing the racial-cultural counseling literature to inform and enhance the cultural responsiveness of their services. To this end, the central goal of the current chapter is to examine the role of RCT in facilitating the delivery of culturally sensitive services. Specifically, the current chapter focuses on the practical interrelationships between RCT and clinical practice. Although we recognize that helping relationships may include various forms of service, for example, advocacy and consultation, we have chosen to focus the current chapter on exploring the counseling relationship for the sake of depth rather than breadth (see Vera, Buhin, Montgomery, & Shin, this Handbook, this volume). Moreover, to provide practical examples of translating theory into practice, Helms's theory of racial identity (1990, 2001) is used for illustrative purposes throughout this chapter. Consequently, we begin with a brief overview of Helms's (2001) theory of racial identity. Next, we address the philosophical assumptions underlying RCT and the relationship between philosophy and practice. Last, we present a model that delineates the role of RCT in informing various aspects of counseling.

This project began as a sequel to studies then being carried out in Canada, Norway, and the United States. It expanded to include a wide range of countries, all of which are experiencing immigration to varying extents. It has involved research with more than 5,000 immigrant youth from 32 ethnocultural groups and smaller samples of their parents and their national peers (i.e., those native to the society of settlement). The study seeks to answer 3 questions. (1) How do immigrant youth live within and between two cultures? These cultures are usually those of their immigrant parents, families, and communities (their heritage culture) on the one hand, and those of their peers and the larger society on the other. We refer to this as the intercultural question. (2) How well (in personal, social, and academic areas of their lives) do immigrant youth deal with their intercultural situation? We refer to this as the adaptation question. (3) We expect that there will be variations (across individuals, ethnocultural groups, and societies of settlement) in the answers to these first two questions. Therefore, the third goal is to discover the patterns of relationships between how adolescents engage in their intercultural relations and how well they adapt. We believe that there are many possible patterns in these relationships, with variations that depend on three set of factors: (a) personal and demographic factors (including age, gender, and length of residence), (b) factors that are external to individuals and their communities (such as the cultural diversity of the society of settlement and their policies with respect to such diversity), and (c) differences between the immigrant groups and the larger society (such as differences in values, and religion). We refer to this as the cross-cultural question. See record [rid]2006-05033-000[/rid] for details of the ICSEY project.

Much of this work has questioned whether classical theories of immigrant adaptation, which assumed assimilation to be an integral part of the process of upward mobility for immigrants, are still applicable to today's immigrant children. This study reevaluates the applicability of classical assimilation theory with a comprehensive empirical assessment of the relationship between assimilation and the well-being of Hispanic and Asian immigrant adolescents. Using Add Health data, we examine the effect of different aspects of assimilation on educational achievement, psychological well-being, and at-risk behaviors. We find that the effect of assimilation varies greatly depending on the ethnic group and outcome under consideration, but that it is generally related to both greater academic achievement and more at-risk behavior. We conclude that assimilation theory is still relevant, but suggest an interpretation that emphasizes a process of decreasing differences between groups rather than either detrimental or beneficial effects of assimilation.

The study also examined how union formation patterns differ across groups of Jamaican women (i.e. born and living in Jamaica, 1st generation Jamaican immigrants, 1.5 generation Jamaicans, 2nd generation, and beyond). It is important to study West Indian union formation patterns since the West Indian immigration rate has been increasing. The black West Indian population in the U.S. grew by about 67% between 1990 and 2000. The growth rate of the black West Indian population is greater than that of other established groups such as the Cubans and Koreans (Logan & Deane, 2003). This study focused specifically on Jamaicans since the bulk of the West Indian migrants is from Jamaica (Peach, 1995). Moreover, they represent both the diversity of modes of incorporation in the U.S. and the range of occupational backgrounds and immigrant status among contemporary immigrants (from professionals and entrepreneurs to laborers, refugees and unauthorized migrants). I used the Reproductive Health Survey 2002 for the analysis of the Jamaican women in Jamaica and the Census 2000 (5% PUMS) for the analysis of non-Hispanic white American and non-Hispanic African women. I also used the National Survey of Family Growth 2002 (NSFG 2002) to assess data quality and for purposes of comparison. I found that Jamaican women’s union formation patterns followed the segmented assimilation model where marriage rates tended to decline across generation and cohabitation rates tended to increase across generation that resembled more the union formation patterns of non-Hispanic African American women. Also, I found that out partnership increased across generation where Jamaican women had much greater odds of out partnering with a non-Hispanic African American partner compared to partnering with a non-Hispanic white American partner.

However, the experience is not the same for every family. The study was conducted in South Florida where there are three major immigrant groups: Hispanics, Haitians and Jamaicans. Families from these groups seem to acculturate in different ways into the American culture and migration among them impacts parents, spouses and children differently. This study focuses on Jamaican families, and their acculturation process due to migration. Qualitative analysis of family experiences among Jamaican families who migrated from Jamaica to the United States at three specific time frames, 6 months, 2 to 4 years and 10 years provided information to create the Jamaican migration theory. Grounded theory techniques were used to study the interviews of participating Jamaican families that met the criteria above. The data obtained were thoroughly analyzed using microanalysis, a grounded theory technique. Microanalysis calls for a specific analysis of data; a process that entails listening very closely to what families say, and how they actually said it (Strauss & Corbin, 1998). Analysis of the data is an intense process where the data are constantly reviewed and analyzed until distinct themes emerge. These themes become the foundation for theories that come into view after continued analysis. This study posits the Jamaican migration theory as represented by findings that indicated how Jamaican families acculturate into the American culture over time.

Results of analysis showed that for Iraqis choosing to resettle here, the outcome is dichotomous: satisfaction or regret. The outcome is influenced by contextual factors as well as facilitating and hindering intervening conditions during the basic social process of resettlement transition. Each refugee's story is unique, yet all share common threads. This study allowed Iraqi refugees the opportunity to voice their personal experiences of resettling in America, and revealed life stories that inspire and illuminate a process that can guide health care delivery as they cope with the stresses of their journey. As a result, an in-depth storyline was established to explain the process of resettlement for Iraqi refugees. The development of this resettlement theory, grounded in Iraqi refugee experience, has the potential to guide nursing education, enhance the efficacy of practice, inform policy development and form the basis for research.

Based on our review of the literature, we suggest specific lines of inquiry regarding immigrants’ experiences with day-to-day discrimination, as well as on the roles that place and immigration policies play in shaping immigrant health outcomes.

This qualitative study used grounded theory development to build a process-oriented and context-sensitive model of bicultural adjustment that was 'grounded' in the perspectives 14 college-age Asian Indian immigrant women living in the mid-Atlantic U.S. This qualitative methodology had the purpose of generating theory about how acculturating Indian women experience, think about, and cope with bicultural demands. Fourteen initial interviews and three follow-up interviews were conducted using a semi-structured and open-ended format. Interviews emphasized respondents' explanations while minimizing contamination from existing conceptual frameworks and observer-based assumptions. The emergent theoretical framework centered on the core category negotiating cultural discrepancies in autonomy, which was embedded within a rich network of linkages among contextual conditions, developmental demands, action strategies, and consequences. Respondents specified five central life domains or contexts (e.g., dating, marriage system, social activities, education and career development, and living independently) and numerous domain-specific rules. The immigrant women identified that decision-making autonomy and belief in individual vs. collective responsibility (please self vs. please others ) strongly influenced their choice of coping strategies. The framework also clarified numerous contextual influences comprised of people pulls, environmental pulls, developmental pulls, and gender role expectations. Additionally, the following process-mediating variables emerged as resources or obstacles across all respondents and life domains: effective vs. ineffective parent-child communication, parental familiarity vs. unfamiliarity with U.S. norms, and availability vs. lack of social support. Finally, the theoretical framework elucidated domain-specific bicultural negotiation strategies. Grounded theory methods clarified that the broad constructs of autonomy and negotiating intercultural discrepancies have divergent meanings both within life spheres and for different people. Current findings can inform preventive interventions that teach adaptive coping skills to young immigrants.

This has certainly helped making Migration Studies one of the fastest growing fields in the social sciences, but it also created a certain pressure to produce fast and 'digestible' results. To find about the actual 'state of knowledge' in integration/assimilation research is difficult, because of the increasing amount of studies on specific cases, groups or problems, but also because there is a lack of agreed-upon theoretical and methodological concepts and indicators. Segmented assimilation theory has also been quite influential here, and many scholars have tried to apply it to European contexts. More explicitly than 'assimilation', the term 'integration' includes structural aspects of incorporation into society, especially with regard to educational achievements and access to the labour market. As part of the tradition of the stronger welfare states in Western Europe, there are more actively designed policies targeting ethnic minority groups to overcome inequalities. The differences between 'assimilation' and 'integration' reflect different discourses and institutional arrangements responding to the challenge of rapidly changing demographic realities as much in the US as in Europe.

Firstly, using concepts from dialogical self theory, we will investigate shifts in I-positions that emerge and dialogical strategies employed to restore continuity in the self that is disrupted by uncertainty (O'Sullivan-Lago & Abreu, 2009, 2010). Secondly, we will explore the symbolic resources (Zittoun, 2006) used by the sisters to examine the developmental transitions they experience (Hale & Abreu, 2010). The theory of dialogical self and the notion of symbolic resources will provide a complementary perspective to enhance current understandings of immigrant young people's experiences. The analysis revisits Portuguese young people's accounts of their immigration to Jersey and their experiences of schooling, collected as part of a larger project on the experiences of Portuguese students in British schools (Abreu & Hale, 2009; Abreu & Lambert; 2003; Abreu, Silva, & Lambert, 2004). We have selected interviews with two sisters who recounted quite different transitions. We will question what new insights can be revealed by using concepts from both the dialogical self and the notion of symbolic resources to explore the accounts of these two sisters who, despite sharing many aspects of their background, recounted very different experiences of their life and schooling in Jersey.

With a qualitative grounded theory methodology (Strauss & Corbin, 1990), multiple data collection methods (open-ended interviews, researcher's journal, and document review) and multiple sources of data (parents, children, and other Chinese informants) were employed to ensure research trustworthiness. Seven recent immigrant Chinese families were primary participants in the study. The convergence and divergence of the accounts of the participants and other informants put forward an immigrant Chinese folk theory. The findings comprise four sections: (a) accounts of the parents; (b) accounts of the children; (c) visible minority experiences; and (d) role of parental expectations. Based on their cultural beliefs and life experiences, the parents mainly addressed their expectations in five areas, namely school achievement, career aspirations, integration of two cultures, moral character, and leadership role. The children expressed their perceptions of parental expectations, their anxious thoughts and feelings, and their self-expectations. All participants shared their thoughts on racial discrimination, visible minority ideology, and dreams of prosperity. Both parents and children affirmed that parental expectations fostered goal orientation, mastery learning experiences, internal control beliefs, and study habits. The study has demonstrated that the relationship between parental expectations of the Chinese immigrants and their children's school achievement is significantly shaped by the dynamic and complex interplay of multiple forces such as indigenous cultural expectations, personal life experiences, and the challenges of acculturation. High parental expectations and children's striving for excellence are rooted in Chinese cultural heritage and are situationally motivated and historically transformed in different ways in response to the demands of the Canadian sociocultual context. By giving voice to this fastest-growing yet under-researched largest visible minority group in Canada, the study makes educational experiences of the Chinese immigrants intelligible to the general public as well as to policy makers. It lends insights to the importance and necessity of anti-racism education. It assists immigrant Chinese parents and children to achieve mutual understanding in the process of acculturation. It also helps teachers and counsellors understand the cultural and family factors involved in schooling for immigrant Chinese children, so as to provide more efficient social and academic mentoring for non-mainstream children, and ultimately to enhance future school-home collaboration.

To fill this gap, I draw on 123 in-depth interviews with 92 undocumented and 31 recently legalized Latino young adults, ages 20–35. Unlike existing scholarship, I examine the experiences of individuals from a range of education levels and address experiences outside of educational institutions (e.g. work, family formation). I find that undocumented young adults experience incomplete incorporation because structural barriers prevent them from fully participating in society in the ways that they desire and expect, giving rise to feelings of exclusion. Specifically, I explore how their undocumented status limits their participation and feelings of belonging in educational, economic, and social institutions. I also address how educational status and gender intersect with the limitations of their undocumented status to differentiate their experiences. While assimilation theorists conceptualize immigrant incorporation as participation in various social institutions, I contend that we must also examine feelings of belonging as a distinct aspect of incorporation. Thus, I re-conceptualize immigrant incorporation as the process through which an immigrant becomes a full member of society, not only by participating in social institutions but also by asserting feelings of belonging. This highlights the understudied dimension of emotional exclusion, and demonstrates how it intersects with structural exclusion to limit incorporation.

In Phase 1, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses extracted a factor for negative perceived context of reception. A subscale corresponding to this factor was used in Phase 2; for parents and adolescents, negative perceived context of reception and perceived discrimination were differentially associated with acculturation-related variables—suggesting discriminant validity between perceived discrimination and negative perceived context of reception.

A review of each framework's interpretation for the varied immigrant adaptation responses is included. In addition, the coping strategies or mediating factors presented by each framework in connection to immigrant adaptation within a new environment are discussed.

Acculturation applies to indigenous peoples (e.g. Aborigines in Australia); established ethno-cultural groups which identify with their country of origin and its language (e.g. the Vietnamese minority in the Czech Republic); immigrants; people coming to the host country voluntarily for a limited period of time (e.g. students, diplomats, laborers); refugees and asylum seekers coming to the host country involuntarily. This review study introduces current knowledge of acculturation, briefly describes the history and development of its investigation, and defines the term acculturation in relation to ethnic identity, assimilation and multiculturalism. It briefly summarizes the sociological and anthropological approach. The study provides a critical review of the most important theories and models based on contact (e.g. Berry’s model of acculturation strategies), adoption of the host culture (e.g. Bourhis interactive acculturation model) and models aimed at identity (e.g. Bicultural identity integration by Benet-Martinez). The study also introduces the acculturation research in the Czech Republic and offers new directions of future research. Last but not least, two approaches to measuring acculturation are mentioned and some examples of the measuring methods are introduced.

Elements from Community Psychology that focus on group-specific settings, community-level analysis, sociocultural resources, sociopolitical forces, and roles of grassroots organizations and host societies in challenging institutional power were consolidated into Berry’s acculturation framework to establish a new framework with a stronger community focus. In a theoretical application utilizing the new community-focused framework, sociohistorical accounts of and discourse on Filipino experiences prior to the beginnings of the Filipino diaspora to Canada in the mid-1990s and more recent Filipino immigrant settlement experiences in Canada were used to examine and gain greater understanding of racial minority immigrant acculturation. The theoretical application of the new framework was presented not only to demonstrate the synthesis of elements derived from Cross-cultural and Community Psychology, as well as the methodological difference between Berry’s acculturation framework and the community-focused version proposed by the author, but also to underscore the value of community-level analysis in the study of racial minority immigrant acculturation.

Although previous studies have extensively examined demographic and residency characteristics, the relative influence of the other factors has not been comprehensively investigated. Multivariate analyses indicated that across the different refugee groups, the model explained 34-44% of the variance in employment status and 12-26% of the variance in estimated earnings.

In this article, several theoretical explanations for the maintenance of religiosity from generation to generation are presented and tested empirically against data from the German Generations- and Gender Surveys. We can show that classical versions of assimilation theories, concepts of symbolic religiosity, of religiosity as a compensation for a lack of social status, or of a high intergenerational stability of values in general cannot fully explain this phenomenon. Religiosity does not decline between the first and the second generation, nor does it become more symbolic in character. Furthermore, empirical evidence yields only limited support for the hypothesis that high levels of individual religiosity can only be found among structurally and socially less assimilated segments of the immigrant population. The same holds true for the argument that they just reflect generally high intergenerational value stability among immigrants. Concequently, in the final section we discuss the role of contextual factors in explaining intergenerational stability in migrants' religiosity such as an increasing diversity of the religious Islamic field or the salience religion as a symbolic boundary marker between natives and migrants.

According to the International Organization for Migration, the number of migrants worldwide was 244 million in 2015. Current literature in cross-cultural adaptability describes acculturation as a 4-phase process, namely honeymoon, crisis, adjustment, and biculturalism (Sawyer, 2012). This approach characterizes all migrants equally, regardless of the type of migrant. This approach however is missing other factors such as an individual’s developmental stage, needs, interests, and exposed/reinforcing memes. Orientations of these characteristics can vary drastically from one immigrant to another, and play an important role in acculturation outcomes. For a successful transition, immigrants and natives alike need to form successful relationships, while immigrants discover how systems work in the new country, and learn how to pursue their goals using the new resources in their new environment. These adaptive behaviors displayed by immigrants and natives are analyzed using stage theory, Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, interests, and memes. In this article, we explore why some individuals and groups adapt better than others. A low-acculturated immigrant operates at a lower stage, may have been and continue to be exposed to memes that are less diverse, have lower needs, and choose more traditional careers. A highly acculturated immigrant operates at a higher stage, may be exposed to more diverse memes, have higher needs and choose more nontraditional careers. Through this analysis, we hope to contribute to a better understanding of immigration processes of different immigrants.

Whereas cross-sectional studies have shown support for these theory-informed relations, comparatively little is known about whether acculturation mismatch negatively affects psychological functioning, or whether offspring’s psychological problems precipitate greater perceived acculturation mismatch via intergenerational cultural conflict. Furthermore, more research is needed to investigate how acculturation and family conflict affect Asian Americans transitioning into college and emerging adulthood. Across two measurement occasions, two cohorts of Asian American first-year college students (N = 555, Mage = 17.99, 56.0% women) completed survey questionnaires assessing their perception of parent–offspring acculturation discrepancies, acculturation-related intergenerational conflict, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. For both sets of psychological functioning, gender invariant structural equation models testing the bidirectional relations demonstrated adequate fit for the data. In the case of externalizing symptoms, acculturation mismatch marginally significantly predicted subsequent intergenerational conflict, but acculturation mismatch did not predict externalizing symptoms via intergenerational cultural conflict. By contrast, offspring’s internalizing and externalizing symptoms respectively predicted greater self-reported intergenerational cultural conflict, which in turn predicted perceived parent–offspring acculturation mismatch over time. These indirect relations suggested that both internalizing and externalizing symptoms indirectly contributed to greater acculturation mismatch through the presence of intergenerational cultural conflict, but data did not support the acculturation gap-distress theory. Theoretical and clinical implications as they pertain to Asian American emerging adults are discussed.

In particular, an expanded operationalization of acculturation is needed to address the 'immigrant paradox,' whereby international migrants with more exposure to the receiving cultural context report poorer mental and physical health outcomes.

Chun, Pamela B. Organista and Geraldo Marin (see record [rid]2002-18425-000[/rid]). Six of the 11 chapters concentrate on normal dimensions of acculturation from psychological perspectives. Their topics cover general concepts, psychometric challenges, identity, values, and family. The last five chapters encompass health psychology and abnormal psychology from an acculturation perspective. These chapters are more data-focused, with 12 tables and only one figure of a model of health and illness. Some chapters address enculturation for minority groups rather than acculturation, although these authors use the term acculturation rather than enculturation. This book should prove interesting and perhaps helpful to several groups of psychiatrists. Those working with immigrants, refugees, and internal migrants (e.g., rural-to-urban migrants) will confirm many of their clinical hunches and perhaps broaden their conceptual horizons regarding migration and its concomitants. Cultural psychiatrists early in their careers will find the volume an excellent entree to recent work on acculturation, particularly the work performed by cultural psychologists.

Method: A narrative literature review on the sociological approach to suicide was undertaken by searching MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO, Google Scholar databases using the following key words: suicide, suicide risk factors, Durkheim’s theory of suicide, integration and disintegration of society, sociodemographic factors, economic factors, religion, and the time descriptors: 2000–2017. Results: Suicide risk was analyzed in relation to: family integration (including the rates of divorce, marriage, fertility, and women’s participation in the labour market); economy (including the unemployment rate, gross domestic product per capita, Gini social inequality index, and social welfare indicators); social issues (including the indicators of the healthcare system quality, the rates of alcohol consumption per capita and migration); religion (including the parameters of conventional religiosity, Gallup index, and percentage of religious books). The issues relevant for Poland were addressed while discussing Balanced Development Index in economic aspect, and dominicantes and communicantes rates in religious aspect. Conclusions: This literature review may be useful in the assessment of suicide risk when designing suicide prevention programs and for mental health clinicians in their daily practice.

Tests of the 'acculturation hypothesis' have established that disparities in certain risks for low birth weight exist between subgroups of women of Mexican-origin. However, disparities observed by neighborhood of residence have yet to be explained. Most tests of the acculturation hypothesis assume a classical path of assimilation, whereby Mexican American health is expected to deteriorate with time spent residing in the U.S. and across the generations. The theory of segmented assimilation suggests that alternative paths are possible depending upon individual characteristics and the context of the neighborhood into which immigrant families and their children reside. This study tested the theory of segmented assimilation as a framework for examining the geographic, cultural, and socioeconomic underpinnings of population differences in infant low birth weight among women of Mexican descent in California using the 2000 U.S. Census and population-based data from the Maternal and Infant Health Assessment (1999–2005) (n = 6442). Little support was found for the theory’s hypotheses. Rather, increased odds for infant low birth weight were observed for English speakers residing in Latino immigrant neighborhoods when compared to English speakers in other neighborhoods, an effect attenuated for Spanish speakers. Elevated odds of low birth weight were also observed among English speakers residing in Latino immigrant neighborhoods when compared to Spanish speakers in the same neighborhoods. Findings suggest the transfer of health-specific social capital in ethnic neighborhoods may depend upon sociocultural consonance between individuals and neighborhood residents. The authors call for additional research that sheds light on the sociocultural dynamics of maternal and infant health at multiple levels.

I also take into account five key social structural factors that segmented assimilation theory and research overlook: (1) the intergenerational nature of assimilation, (2) life course stage, (3) where immigrants start out on their paths of assimilation, or their 'starting points,' (4) gender, and (5) immigrant generational status. Binomial and multinomial logistic regression analyses reveal that paths of assimilation and the factors associated with them differ according to starting point, gender, immigrant generational status, and, in the case of intragenerational assimilation, life course stage. These associations are enormously complicated and do not follow a coherent pattern. Nonetheless, a number of my findings contradict segmented assimilation's claims. For example, blacks from intermediate economic starting points have more positive mobility outcomes than whites. Additionally, elements traditionally associated with minority oppositional subcultures, such as negative views of race relations in the U.S. and experiences of discrimination, are related to positive economic mobility and classical acculturation paths for children of immigrants. These results indicate that exposure to native minorities may not have the detrimental effects that segmented assimilation alleges. Among the protective factors, while parent-youth relationships are consistently important for predicting economic and cultural assimilation, I find little evidence that cultural attachments promote greater economic success among immigrants' offspring. These results suggest that immigrants' cultural attributes may be less important for their success than the quality of their family relationships.

Sleep could be described at the behavioral level (relative lack of movements and awareness and responsiveness) and at the brain level (based on EEG activity). Sleep could be characterized by its duration, by its distribution during the 24‐hr day period, and by its quality (e.g., consolidated versus fragmented). Different methods have been developed to assess various aspects of sleep. This chapter covers the most established and common methods used to assess sleep in infants and children. These methods include polysomnography, videosomnography, actigraphy, direct observations, sleep diaries, and questionnaires. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are highlighted.

The model is derived from an integration of three distinct theoretical traditions: Social Representations Theory (SRT), Social Identity Theory (SIT), and Berry's model of acculturation tendencies (BAT). SRT describes the content of identities, and contends that they are context and time specific constructions largely shared by members of a society, by which they locate themselves relative to other social sectors within a shared meta-system. SRT theory does not offer specific instrumental operations for its measurement. SIT and BAT, in contrast, offer instrumental operations (strategies) derived from each theory. According to Tajfei, immigrants as well as minority groups seek ways to enhance their social status. Berry, however, focuses on immigrant acculturation tendencies resulting from their positioning between their original culture and their new one. In our model, we combined strategies from each of the theories, but instead of choosing between them, based on SRT, we used Gunman's method of Smallest Space Analysis to explore how the immigrants and their non-immigrant peers constructed the strategies discussed in the SIT and BAT models. Based on this theoretical rationale, the research hypothesis predicted that a shared construction of immigrant identities would be found for immigrants and native high school students (as suggested by SRT), and that immigrant identities would be constructed according to dimensions of power and acculturation tendencies (in line with SIT and BAT). The findings, based on 621 high school students, supported these hypotheses.

Beginning with classical assimilation theory in the 1920s, theorists defined the incorporation process as a linear path for all immigrants, regardless of group characteristics or social context. The responsibility for change was placed solely on the immigrant group. By the 1960s, theorists had redefined assimilation to acknowledge different paths of integration influenced by interactions of immigrant group characteristics with the host society context. Modern theories branching from classic assimilation theory include segmented assimilation and spatial assimilation and theories focusing on ethnic group influences. The review concludes with implications for better understanding influences of interactions between human behavior and the social environment as they relate to immigrant populations.

Service providers that work within this community noted significant levels of problematic alcohol consumption among Bhutanese-Nepali refugees. This alcohol misuse was noted to be associated with intimate partner violence and major health problems among refugees. The goal of this dissertation was twofold; to examine the relationships between social barriers and the sources of strain that refugees deal with in their daily lives, and to explore the link between these barriers and adverse behavioral outcomes such as problem drinking and violence. Agnew's (1992) General Strain Theory (GST) is used to explain the relationship between refugee barriers and deviant behavioral outcomes. This research is based on an analysis of 66 qualitative interviews collected from April to July 2017 with 100 Bhutanese-Nepali refugees from a single community. Findings show that major sources of strain for Bhutanese-Nepali refugees include language acquisition, employment problems, and acculturation stress. These sources of strain contribute to problem drinking behaviors due to a lack of coping resources among Bhutanese-Nepali refugees that would support non-deviant coping. The use of alcohol to cope may then contribute to criminal behavioral outcomes such as intimate partner violence. These findings imply that interventions aimed at reducing problematic alcohol use within this community must also be aimed at reducing the underlying sources of refugee strains that can lead to the misuse of alcohol and the negative consequences thereof.

They are admitted into adult status by formal and informal processes, which can be abrupt or gradual and which in Britain take place at different ages in different areas of social activity. In investigating the position of coloured, immigrant youth in Great Britain this model of an integrative social system articulated through common values is inadequate and moreover misleading. It leads to conceptualizing the problems in terms of value differences and sees the resolution of these problems in terms of adequate socialization for integration into British society. The social position of youth cannot be separated from the overall social structure in which it is located nor can the approach to youth, as a sociological problem, be understood apart from the general theoretical scheme which is used, implicitly or explicitly, to define and analyze the problem. In putting forward a perspective in which the 'problems' associated with youth can be seen as more general problems, many areas frequently associated with youth have been neglected. The aim of the paper has been, however, not to cover 'youth problems' comprehensively but to argue that a new approach to the subject, which puts it firmly into a framework of dialectical structural change, will prove more fruitful both for the analysis of past work and for future research.

Three factors common to the 6 theories of behavior change are reviewed and examples of their application to Latinos and especially Mexican immigrants are given. The 3 factors are: intention, environmental facilitators and constraints, and skills. To support the argument that health behavior may be driven by broader societal factors than theoretical factors typically addressed in health behavior theory, the authors present the 3 most salient issues affecting immigrants: SES, the geographical proximity of the homeland, and the political atmosphere in which new immigrants may find themselves.

Data were collected on mothers' self-reported acculturative status, parenting practices and cultural socialization, and on children's behavioral functioning (mother- and teacher-report) and school readiness (child test). Results provide partial support for the validity of the framework in which mothers' acculturative status and socialization of respeto (a Latino cultural value of respect) and independence (a U.S. American cultural value) predict parenting practices. For both groups, English language competence was related to less socialization of respeto, and other domains of acculturative status (i.e., U.S. American/ethnic identity, and U.S. American/ethnic cultural competence) were related to more socialization of respeto and independence. Socialization of respeto was related to the use of authoritarian practices and socialization of independence was related to the use of authoritative practices. Socialization of respeto was also related to lower school readiness for DA children, whereas socialization of independence was related to higher school readiness for MA children. Independence was also related to higher teacher-rated externalizing problems for MA children. For both groups, authoritarian parenting was associated with more parent-reported internalizing and externalizing problems.

In the present study, we examined how cultural determinants, such as symptom experience, beliefs and interpretations, and perceptions about the social environment, affect PN and HS type for Japanese women living in the United States. Increasing physical symptom severity increased the predicted probability of endorsing PN. For those participants with PN, 48.6% of them used medical HS (χ2 = 11.27, p = .00), and 12.5% of them used the psychological HS (χ2 = 7.43, p = .01).

The objectives of this dissertation are threefold: First, to develop an expanded and integrated explanatory model of Latino acculturative stress that accounts for culture, stress and coping, cognitive appraisal, timing, and family and neighborhood factors; second, to evaluate the reliability and validity evidence of the English language version of the CESD-R; and third, to evaluate the reliability and validity evidence of the Spanish language version of the CESD-R. The first manuscript posits an explanatory model that expands upon and integrates work by Berry (2006) and most notably adds the dimension of family and neighborhood. Recent research findings on Latino immigrant depression point toward the importance of understanding and leveraging the protective nature of neighborhood and family (Breslau, 2011; Shell, Peek, & Eschbach, 2013). The second manuscript evaluates the validity and reliability evidence of the English language version of the CESD-R. The results of an EFA, CFAs, and a multiple-group CFA of the English version of the CESD-R suggest that a 15-item version of the CESD-R best fit the study data. The final two-factor solution of negative mood and functional impairment and suicide, fit the data well. The third manuscript evaluates the reliability and validity evidence of the Spanish language version of the CESD-R. The scores of the Spanish Language version of the CESD-R fit the same CESD-R factor structure of Manuscript II. The results support the use of the 15-item version of the CESD-R with a Spanish speaking sample. This suggests that despite cultural differences, there are common cross-cultural components of depression that relate to negative mood and functional impairment and suicide.

Within such communities, international migration becomes so deeply rooted that the prospect of transnational movement becomes normative: young people 'expect' to live and work in the US at some point in their lives. Males, especially, come to see migration as a normal part of the life course, representing a marker of the transition to manhood, in addition to being a widely accepted vehicle for economic mobility. International migration is cultural in the sense that the aspiration to migrate is transmitted across generations and between people through social networks. In this article, the authors develop a formal theory of the culture of migration and test it using 7,061 students in grades 6-12 (ages 9-23). Results show that children from families involved in US migration are more likely to aspire to live and work in the US and that these aspirations, in turn, influence their behavior, lowering the odds that they will continue in school, and raising the odds of their eventual out-migration to the US.

Adjustment to a new culture is a difficult process and can have an impact on a woman's self, self image, and identity. The creation of identity requires a culture with systems, language, and images. Therefore, how can a woman recreate her own identity and find new meaning of the self in a new culture? This is an important question not only for the individuals themselves but for those who work with them. Due to the lack of attention paid to this group, mental health professionals and others who provide services to them may be unaware of the particular issues these women face. These women face challenges to their identity and sense of self that can be best explained from a psychodynamic point of view. Therefore, using the heuristic research model, this theoretical research investigates the impact of immigration and living in the bicultural environment on the self structure of young Polish immigrant women. Concepts from two different theoretical orientations, self psychology and Winnicott's and his followers' theories, are used to examine the emergence of the self in this particular immigrant group. Specific emphasis is put on the process of reconstruction of the self in the bicultural environment. The dissertation begins with an explanation of pre-immigration and immigration stages and a discussion of the structure of the self among young Polish immigrant women. Next, an investigation of the process of assimilation to a new environment is conducted. After this, the concept of the bicultural space, seen as significant in understanding the bicultural woman's inner experience, is introduced. Then, in order to illustrate these concepts and provide a portrayal of a typical Polish immigrant, the hypothetical case of a young Polish woman named Anna is presented. Finally, the concept of the bicultural identity is presented, followed by a discussion of the research, including the analysis of five models of second culture acquisition and the incorporation of new findings.

With the help of some recent liberal critiques of multiculturalism, the first part maps out some shortcomings of the notion of minority integration through cultural recognition, particularly with respect to immigrants. The second part discusses a retreat from multiculturalism policies in three states that had been prominently committed to them: Australia, the Netherlands, and Britain. This practical retreat of multiculturalism is due to a variety of factors, their importance differing across cases: the chronic lack of public support for multiculturalism policies; inherent deficits and failures of multiculturalism policies, especially in socio-economic respect; and a new assertiveness of the liberal state to impose liberal principles.

Among Latinos, important cultural factors include familial support, immigration, and acculturation/enculturation. Previous research has emphasized the importance of taking into account stressors related to immigration and the acculturation process. These findings highlight the importance of examining these cultural factors to further our understanding of the victimization-delinquency overlap among Latino youth. Extending this body of literature to include factors salient to Latinos is particularly timely given the recent rapid growth of this population in the United States. One approach for conceptualizing the victimization-delinquency overlap is to examine the relationship within a general strain theory (GST) framework. However, there are several gaps in the GST literature that this study intends to address. First, a more nuanced, culturally-sensitive understanding of the victimization-delinquency overlap among Latino youth will be gained from the proposed study. Second, the concept of victimization will be expanded to include a measure of polyvictimization, which has not been examined in previous GST studies. Finally, this study proposes to evaluate the role of several key emotions as mediators in the GST process. The findings of this study are important for shaping policy and clinical practice, including school- and family-based interventions, and mental health treatment. The overarching goal of research on the victimization-delinquency overlap, and GST more specifically, is to better understand how victimized individuals go on to commit crime and thus develop prevention programs to dissuade criminal behavior. It is important to consider, however, that a one-size-fits-all approach to crime prevention may not be most effective. Thus, incorporating cultural factors into the study of GST among Latino youth can help elucidate which cultural factors protect these adolescents from engaging in criminal activity and provide recommendations for relevant crime prevention policy.

While the theory has been interpreted in many different ways, we emphasize its implications for the important role of social context: both processes and consequences of assimilation should depend on the local social context in which immigrants are embedded. We derive empirically falsifiable hypotheses about the interaction effects between social context and assimilation on immigrant children’s well-being. We then test the hypotheses using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Our empirical analyses yield two main findings. First, for immigrant adolescents living in non-poverty neighborhoods, we find assimilation to be positively associated with educational achievement and psychological well-being but also positively associated with at-risk behavior. Second, there is little empirical evidence supporting our hypotheses derived from segmented assimilation theory. We interpret these results to mean that future research would be more fruitful focusing on differential processes of assimilation rather than differential consequences of assimilation.

It expressed a new appreciation of the danger to Whites of conflict based on colour. Before 1905 most observers assumed the inferiority of Blacks and saw race conflict as the fault of African Americans. But a new possibility arose when the fate of African Americans was linked to the rising power of Japan, occurring after the defeat of Russia by Japan in 1904–5. Race conflict, in this new model, was a form of conflict between nations. Race relations pioneer Robert E. Park, in his 1913 article, ‘Racial Assimilation in Secondary Groups’, noted that ‘under conditions . . . of individual liberty and individual competition, characteristic of modern civilization, depressed racial groups tend to assume the form of nationalities. A nationality, in this narrower sense, may be defined as the racial group which has attained self-consciousness, no matter whether it has at the same time gained political independence or not.’ Yuill's paper will explore the thesis that a liberal perspective based on developments in contemporary international relations slowly changed the way race was regarded in the United States. From 1905 onwards, a new liberal paradigm sought to manage race conflict. It was this—rather than labour-based racial antipathies or commitment to racial equality—that shaped US race relations in the twentieth century.

This chapter begins with an overview of immigration patterns and the various issues such as socioeconomic status and demographic risk factors that must be considered in understanding immigrant families. We then discuss some of the key historical concepts and frameworks that have guided our current field of immigration, followed by contemporary theories. A particular focus will be on the context of immigrant families and their cultural contexts, placing this section within the world-views on cultural orientation. The acculturation processes and parent-child discrepancies will be explored and the extent to which they impact child development. Some attention to the gendered experiences of acculturation and parenting will follow. We conclude by discussing some of the limitations of this field and provide suggestions for theory development and advancing our understanding of immigration and families.

The authors propose that acculturation and transition are influenced by factors at both the societal and individual level and therefore interventions aimed at promoting successful integration should be focused at both those levels.

Importantly, with the ever-present migration of persons across countries and cultures, physical boundaries of language have been blurred creating a robust area of study: language brokering in the context of globalization. Migration and immigration often necessitate the learning of a new language and in immigrant families, open an opportunity for language skill differences and language brokering. Language brokering is a process by which a bilingual individual, often the children of immigrants, assists in communication between two parties speaking distinct languages. This common practice has generated an increased focus and body of research on the current and aftereffects of language brokering on individuals who broker. The present article provides a brief review of the literature on language brokering including identified antecedents and select outcomes such as family, academic, and psychological outcomes. Overall, the literature shows the associations among language brokering, the contexts in which it may occur, and the outcomes (family, academic, and psychological) for language brokers remain less than clearly understood, although inroads are being made as researchers delve more deeply into specific areas such as parentification, age, child development, and family dynamics.

Research suggests, however, that immigrant families who maintain a balance between retaining pieces of their home culture while incorporating parts of the new (in other words, who find an integration of the different cultures) experience the best outcomes. Maintaining some values and customs from the country of origin may be better for the mental health of the family members. Moreover, involvement in ethnic community networks in the new country is also critical in buffering against discrimination, creating some continuity, and coping with some of the inevitable social and cultural losses. Indeed, recreating ethnic community networks highly correlates with general health and mental health as well. With the ever-increasing diversity among immigrant families in the United States, each with distinct cultural norms and values, varying migration, and living arrangements, as well as unique familial patterns, the validity and usefulness of traditional models of family therapy may be outdated, at least when universally applied. Family therapists are finding it increasingly necessary to both select relevant techniques among various models and fit their approaches to the needs of the clients rather than the other way around.

As the majority of research on foreigner objectification has emerged out of the United States, the chapter focuses on the foreigner objectification experiences of two rapidly growing US racial/ethnic groups: Latinos/as and Asian Americans. It first contextualizes foreigner objectification within the larger literature on attitudes toward racial/ethnic minority groups. It then discusses how foreigner objectification has been measured in psychological research and examines the limited but growing literature on the association between foreigner objectification and mental and physical health.

Gender differences in language brokering activity, theory of mind ability, and academic achievement were also examined. There is a paucity of research on theory of mind development in older children from low SES and ethnic minority communities, as well as children from cultures outside the United States and Western Europe. There is no research on the relation between language brokering, theory of mind ability, and academic achievement. This study uses both a cultural approach and a theory of mind approach to study the socio-cognitive development of Latino preadolescents from immigrant families. Participants were 117 Mexican American 6th graders (M = 11.33 years; 56 girls, 61 boys) from a semi-rural agricultural community in Oregon. Each participant completed a questionnaire consisting of the Language Brokering Scale, the Short Acculturation Scale for Hispanic Youth, the Parent-Child Bonding Scale, and demographic information. Participants also completed tests of receptive English vocabulary (PPVT-III), receptive Spanish vocabulary (TVIP), and responded to two theory of mind vignettes developed to assess higher order theory of mind ability. Participants who reported being chosen as the primary language broker out-performed non-primary language brokers on theory of mind ability, things brokered, GPA, and reading achievement test scores. Girls out-performed boys on theory of mind ability, biculturalism, Spanish vocabulary, and GPA. Non-primary girls language brokered for more people than primary girls, and non-primary boys language brokered for less people than primary boys. Non-primary girls also reported more biculturalism than any other sub-group. English vocabulary, language broker order, and feelings about brokering were positively related to theory of mind ability for boys. Language broker order and biculturalism were positively related to theory of mind ability for girls. The relationship between theory of mind ability and academic achievement was non-existent for girls, and seemed to be masked by language brokering variables for boys. These results are discussed in relation to cultural variation in theory of mind, and traditional Latino gender socialization goals. Implications for the classroom and suggestions for future research are also discussed.

Alejandro Portes and Min Zhou's theory offers a new perspective to the question: Under what conditions are youth susceptible to marijuana use and delinquent behavior? In contrast to Milton Gordon's classic one-path theory, segmented assimilation theory looks to the immigrant culture and social capital as critical factors in the assimilation process. The theory suggests several different types of adaptation by immigrant youth and Asian youth born in the US. The data from the Asian Student Drug Survey were used to analyze the patterns of marijuana use and delinquent behavior among Japanese, Chinese, Filipino, Korean, Southeast Asian, Asian Indian, and Pacific Islander youth, controlling for human capital and social capital, as well as other relevant factors. The likelihood of marijuana use differed significantly among the ethnic groups. Segmented assimilation theory points to the importance of the human and social capital that serve to insulate youth from the influence of the teen drug and delinquent cultures.

Linear assimilation models continue to dominate public health research despite the availability of more complex acculturation theories that propose multidimensional frameworks, reciprocal interactions between the individual and the environment, and other acculturative processes among various Latino groups. Because linear and unidimensional assessments (e.g., nativity, length of stay in the United States, and language use) provide constricted measures of acculturation, the rare use of multidimensional acculturation measures and models has inhibited a more comprehensive understanding of the association between specific components of acculturation and particular health outcomes. A public health perspective that incorporates the roles of structural and cultural forces in acculturation may help identify mechanisms underlying links between acculturation and health among Latinos.

Family therapists are said to have taken universalist, particularist, ethnic-focused, or multidimensional positions. The rationale for a MCF is based on the assumption that in a multicultural society, each person is raised in several cultural subgroups and draws selectively from the groups' relative influences. Concepts addressed include cultural borderlands and ecological niches. Training objectives include taking culture in the mainstream of FT and generating an attitude of interest, sociological imagination, and respectful curiosity about culture. Key comparative parameters are the ecological context, migration and acculturation, family organization, and family life cycle.

New immigrants constitute the majority of immigrants to this country. At the individual level of acculturation, a person must confront two general issues that are in opposition and may create conflict: (1) the maintenance and development of one's ethnic distinctiveness by retaining one's cultural identity, and (2) the desire to seek interethnic contact by valuing and maintaining positive relations with the dominant society. Subsumed in these dimensions are changes in multiple domains for immigrants: physical changes, biological changes, social relationships, language change, cognitive processes, personality, identity, cultural attitudes and values, and acculturative stress. Acculturation studies to date have been involved in the measurement of length of residence in the United States, age of entry into the United States, language change, ethnic identity, social behaviors and orientation, cultural attitudes and values, family differences, and generational differences. This writing describes the constructs and empirical findings in the measurement of acculturation and ethnic identity. Acceptable measures are identified and listed, and the measurement perspectives behind the development of these measures are explored.

The objective of this analysis was to increase our understanding of immigrant and refugee women’s responses to abuse. We conducted in-depth interviews with 84 women who immigrated from Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Engendering Resilience to Survive emerged as the core category explaining women’s strength to stay safe and survive IPV experiences. In the face of the violence they experienced, women in this sample demonstrated remarkable resilience and the ability to harness their strength to survive. Resilience as a process and outcome could facilitate empowerment, and self-directedness to access health services and resources to stay safe. The developed Engendering Resilience to Survive Model can be utilized as a framework to inform research, policy, and practice to support abused women.

First, it aims to develop a theoretical model of the acculturative process of immigrant adolescents based on the understanding of the relationships among acculturative stress, coping, and growth. Second, it aims to propose a typology that offers distinct patterns in the process of acculturation and the resulting outcomes. Using the grounded theory method, the study identified stress related to communication problems, ethnic prejudice, academic pressure, homesickness, and interpersonal conflict. The lack of social support and the school climate were identified as contextual factors of perceived stress. Peer mediation and motivation were identified as intervention factors of coping behaviors. The immigrant adolescent coping behaviors included media use for emotional release, focus on a goal, connectedness to the home country, and the creation of social capital in the host country. The typology of different acculturative patterns classified immigrant adolescents into three types: adaptive, academic, and competent. Based on the findings, the significance of family functioning, peer mediation, self-expansion motivation, and coping behaviors to create social capital for immigrant adolescents' normal development was discussed.

Results show that attitude, overall health concern, and self-efficacy accounted for 58% of the variance in behavioral intention for all Ss. Attitude, perceived barriers, and self-efficacy accounted for 19% of the variance in the prediction of dietary fat reduction behaviors. In general, a gradient was seen in the increased predictiveness of each regression model by degree of acculturation of the immigrants to US culture: predictiveness for behavior ranged from 15% for the least to 34% for the most acculturated. Acculturation was significantly related to declines in the influence of habit and of social norms. These effects were not seen by length of residency.

First, their intentions were categorized as either purposeful or expedient, and either differential or assimilative. With basic analyses, the validity of the categorization was supported. Causal factors explaining intention were examined through hierarchical logistic regression models. The intention to acquire local voting right increased through differential factors, while it decreased through factors that pointed toward resistance against assimilation. The intention to acquire voting rights increased through general attitudes and attributions independent of individual factors, and these variables had little to do with assimilation. The intention to naturalize increased through affection toward Japan, and decreased through ethnic self-esteem as 9 Korean. This suggests that the intent to naturalize is assimilative. These analyses indicate the necessity of an active role on the part of the social environment for purposeful naturalization which preserves the ethnic identity of the Koreans.
