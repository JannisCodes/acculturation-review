While the workplace represents an important context of social integration, previous studies evaluating the effect of discrimination experienced in the workplace found worse mental health status among immigrants. The aim of this study was to investigate whether self-perceived workplace discrimination has any role in the mental health status of immigrants living and working in Italy, evaluating the contribution of other personal experiences, such as loneliness and life satisfaction. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 12,408 immigrants (aged 15–64) living and working in Italy. Data were derived from the first national survey on immigrants carried out by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (Istat). Mental health status was measured through the Mental Component Summary (MCS) of the SF-12 questionnaire. A linear multivariate linear regression was carried out to evaluate the association between mental health status, self-perceived workplace discrimination, and sociodemographic factors; path analysis was used to quantify the mediation effect of self-perceived loneliness, level of life satisfaction, and the Physical Component Summary (PCS). Results: Mental health status was inversely associated (p < 0.001) with self-perceived workplace discrimination (β:-1.737), self-perceived loneliness (β:-2.653), and physical health status (β:-0.089); it was directly associated with level of life satisfaction (β:1.122). As confirmed by the path analysis, the effect of self-perceived workplace discrimination on MCS was mediated by the other factors considered: self-perceived loneliness (11.9%), level of life satisfaction (20.7%), and physical health status (3.9%). Conclusions: Our study suggests that self-perceived workplace discrimination is associated with worse mental health status in immigrant workers through personal experiences in the workplace and explains the effect of the exposure to workplace discrimination on immigrants’ psychological well-being. Our findings suggest that an overall public health response is needed to facilitate the social integration of immigrants and their access to health services, particularly those services that address mental health issues. © 2021, The Author(s).","Discrimination; Immigrant; Mediation analysis; Mental health status; Workplace","adolescent; article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; demography; human; human experiment; immigrant; integration; Italy; life satisfaction; linear regression analysis; loneliness; mediation analysis; path analysis; personal experience; psychological well-being; public health; quantitative analysis; questionnaire; Short Form 12; worker; workplace",,,,,,"We thank Jacqueline M.

Although there are several international surveys and indicators that provide different figures of victimisation and the perpetration of violence among immigrant and indigenous adolescents, there are few studies that delve into the characteristics and cultural dimensions of dating violence in these groups. Objective: The purpose of this review is to bring together and interpret the qualitative studies on TDV among immigrant adolescents that have been developed in the last 10 years to review the associated cultural aspects. Methods: For this purpose, six electronic databases and specialised research journals were searched. Only 10 qualitative studies met the selection criteria, of which 3 analysed young Asians and 7 analysed Latinos in English-speaking countries (9 in the US and 1 in New Zealand). The thematic analysis approach was used to cross-culturally compare and interpret the findings of the studies. Results: The results show differences in the conception of dating, love and violence among adolescents of Asian, Latin and Western origin. A different weight is observed in institutions that reproduce intimate partner violence according to different family models, gender roles and axiological-normative systems (the shame-honour system and honour-based violence). Finally, cultural differences in the impact of migrations are analysed according to the type of society of origin and destination, the levels of acculturation and generational status. Conclusions: These dimensions should be considered when designing TDV prevention programmes for multicultural contexts or when focusing on immigrant groups. © 2021","Cultural dimensions; Metasynthesis; Teen dating violence","adolescent; Asian; conception; cultural factor; dating violence; female; human; human experiment; immigrant; male; New Zealand; partner violence; qualitative research; review; sex role; shame; speech; systematic review; thematic analysis",,,,,"RTI2018-101668-B-I00","This research is funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economic Affairs.

In this qualitative study, the aim was to understand Syrian refugee women's needs for care and the predisposing and enabling factors to healthcare access and utilisation. Methods: Out of 945 Syrian mothers who gave birth in our university hospital between 2014 and 2018, 195 were reached; out of which, 47 women were included. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted and were later analysed using a qualitative content analysis approach. Depression was assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 at the end of the interview. Results: Social isolation and maternal depression, language barrier and challenges while navigating the healthcare system emerged as the main themes of the study. Low educational and occupational status of the women, poor social resources, limited Turkish proficiency and unfamiliarity with the host healthcare system were identified as the predisposing factors for poor healthcare services utilisation. Conclusion: Recommendations include bridging language gaps, improving the navigation of the healthcare system by visual support or in-person interpretation, and psychosocial support. Providing hospital-based language courses to mothers and social integration programs for families will improve the mothers' well-being and indirectly care of the child. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

This novel account of Mexican Americans’ manifestation of ethnicity draws on 70 qualitative interviews and a random sample of about 1500 US-born Mexican Americans. Written fluently and in a moving style, it probes the “cultural assimilability and Americanness” of Mexican Americans. This research and its findings are relevant to a broader range of audiences in the US and are of special interest to academic and public debates on immigration and integration in Europe. In what follows, I will reflect on the book’s main findings and conclusions and review the newly developed symbolic-consequential ethnicity scale. I will conclude by discussing the relevance of the findings for the European migration experience and suggest the need for comparative research. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","assimilation; ethnicity; European Turks; identity; international migration; Mexican Americans","acculturation; comparative study; cultural identity; ethnicity; immigrant population; international migration; research work; Europe",,,,,,,,"Alba, R.D., Nee, V., (2009) Remaking the American Mainstream: Assimilation and Contemporary Immigration, , Cambridge/New York: Harvard University Press; Amelina, A., Faist, T., De-naturalizing the National in Research Methodologies: Key Concepts of Transnational Studies in Migration (2012) Ethnic and Racial Studies, 35 (10), pp. 1707-1724; Crul, M., Schneider, J., Comparative Integration Context Theory: Participation and Belonging in New Diverse European Cities (2010) Ethnic and Racial Studies, 33 (7), pp. 1249-1268; Ganzeboom, H.B.G., Sozeri, E.K., Guveli, A., Bayrakdar, S., (2015), 2000 Families: Migration Histories of Turks Europe, Data Documentation, VU University of Amsterdam; Guveli, A., Are Movers More Religious than Stayers?

The aim of the present study was to adapt the MSLSS for use with a sample of Palestinian primary school children (N = 1215) living in refugee camps. The instrument’s factor structure was analyzed via exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. The divergent validity of the MSLSS scores was tested with respect to self-rated measurements of affect balance and symptoms of trauma. The results supported a robust four-factor 14-item structure (RMSEA =.030; NFI =.973, TLI =.981; CFI =.985) with good internal reliability. The four factors were satisfaction with family, friends, school and environment and they were stable across age groups. In conclusion, this adapted version of the MSLSS in Arabic is a quick, valid, and reliable scale for assessing children’s life satisfaction that may be used in contexts of political violence and low-intensity warfare. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cross-cultural adaptation; Life satisfaction; Multidimensional Student Life Satisfaction Scale; Palestinian school children",,,,,,,,,"Allden, K., Jones, L., Weissbecker, I., Wessells, M., Bolton, P., Betancourt, T.S., Hijazi, Z., Sumathipala, A., Mental health and psychosocial support in crisis and conflict: Report of the mental health working group (2009) Prehospital and Disaster Medicine, 24 (S2), pp. s217-s227. , PID: 19806544; (2010) Publication manual of the American Psychological Association, , American Psychological Association, Washington, DC; Arbuckle, J.L., (2011) Amos (Version 21) [Computer software], , IBM SPSS, Chicago; Arlot, S., Celisse, A., A survey of cross-validation procedures for model selection (2010) Statistics Surveys, 4, pp. 40-79; Asher, S.R., Hymel, S., Renshaw, P.D., Loneliness in children (1984) Child Development, 55, pp. 1456-1464; Bender, T.A., Assessment of subjective well-being in children and adolescents (1997) Handbook of classroom assessment: Learning, achievement, and adjustment, pp. 3-28. , Phye G, (ed), Academic Press, San Diego; Bollen, J., Van de Sompel, H., Hagberg, A., Chute, R., A principal component analysis of 39 scientific impact measures (2009) PLoS One, 4. , PID: 19562078; Boynton, P.M., Greenhalgh, T., Selecting, designing and developing your questionnaire (2004) British Medical Journal, 328, pp. 1312-1315. , PID: 15166072; Businaro, N., Pons, F., Albanese, O., Do intelligence, intensity of felt emotions and emotional regulation have an impact on life satisfaction?

Scholars have debated whether the planning of public spaces, which presumably fosters inter-group encounter, potentially reduces prejudice against minorities such as migrants, and eventually promotes social inclusiveness. This research uses a large-scale questionnaire survey conducted in 36 neighbourhoods (estates) in Beijing, China, combined with field observations and interviews, to investigate whether the presence, perception and use of neighbourhood-scale spaces of encounter are relevant in predicting residents’ attitudes towards migrant social inclusion, particularly with respect to equal access to citizenship and government welfare. Qualitative and quantitative analyses found that residents’ inclusiveness attitude is less associated with the physical presence of public spaces and facilities in the neighbourhood, and more with actually using such spaces for neighbourly encounters in daily life. The findings echo recent critiques of the romanticised view of public spaces for urban encounters, and suggest that neighbourhood planning of public spaces should incorporate elements from social projects that facilitate meaningful interaction between native and migrant residents to achieve the goal of building an inclusive city. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2019.","activity diary; migration; neighbourhood; public space; social integration; social justice","citizenship; neighborhood; perception; public attitude; public space; questionnaire survey; social inclusion; state role; urban ecosystem; Beijing [China]; China",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 41529101, 41571144, 41571153, 41801157

Since the latest refugee wave includes more highly educated people, higher education institutions might serve as a strong inclusion instrument to integrate them into local communities. Norway has established a novel recognition procedure for persons without verifiable documentation. This study introduces this new methodology to policymakers and discusses its limitations, to enlarge scholarly debate on creating a joint European framework for recognizing prior qualifications. The study adopted a qualitative methodology, with a descriptive account of data derived from interviews with NOKUT officers. The findings highlight an urgent need in Europe to start an initiative for establishing a joint European qualification passport, which would be very useful due to the transferability of recognition decisions across European countries. © 2019 The Authors.

In many countries there is no access to shari'ha compliant financial instruments, despite the presence of immigrants and citizens whose religion defines the financial world. The article focuses on a topic that is not very in-depth analysed in social sciences, it combines the perspective of studies on Islam in the diaspora with the instruments of sociology of money and finance with a particular focus on management of resources by families. What happens in contexts where the majority acts, buys and invests following different modalities, norms and attitudes? Is reconciling the respect of the norms on finance provided by religion with a daily life that speaks and is connoted by different languages and behaviours an objective of the Muslim? The article has an exploratory perspective and investigates in depth representations and practices of the Muslim community in Turin, with a field research conducted through semi-structured interviews and focus groups and dialoguing with other qualitative researches on the same subject. The study is framed in the analysis of the diffusion of Islamic finance, reported at the beginning of the article, from which emerges a logic directed to the differentiation of investments for the risk management on international financial markets, rather than a logic directed to offer services for the support of social integration of the communities. © 2020 Societa Editrice il Mulino.

Methods: A social study that was descriptive in nature was conducted with a quantitative empirical-analytical focus. Results: Results from discriminant function analysis indicate that 86% of group membership was correctly classified from gender alone, with female learning environments leading to greater future success. Conclusions: It can be concluded that the predictive results possess methodological coherence. Thus, from them we can propose possible development strategies, particularly targeting males, in order to improve learning and promote social integration. According to the results obtained, improvement of learning strategies and strengthening of the very learning environments, demands new policies to be established which promote emotional improvement and better futures for UFM, especially males. © 2020 by the authors.

Typically, national health surveillance systems do not have the resources to ensure proper representation of these small population groups. This study reports factors that guided the cultural adaptation and administration of the National Cancer Institute's Health Information Trends National Survey (HINTS) for a United States-dwelling Pacific Islander population in Hawai'i. To adapt the survey, four focus groups were conducted with 32 purposively-selected Micronesian migrants. Themes on health, healthcare barriers, cancer and methods to implement the survey were extracted from the analyses of the focus group narratives. Key cultural factors were identified that impact health practices, including religious and cancer fatalism, racism, health locus of control and other barriers. Using information from the focus group participants, the HINTS questionnaire was modified and the survey was implemented.

Although these phenomena are also frequently encountered in work with refugees, the adaptivity to refugees has not yet been empirically proven and has even been questioned. This pilot study, which was based on the mixed methods design, examined whether refugees can also benefit from engaging in splitting processes during their arrival in the new country. Material and methods: In interpreter-assisted interviews 16 refugees reported about their refugee experiences, their early days and their current life in Germany and answered questionnaires on identity development. On the basis of developed operationalization guidelines and taxonomies, the interview transcripts were assessed with respect to splitting processes during the arrival in the new country (retrospectively) and at the time the survey was conducted. In addition, the functionality of the identity was also rated. Results: With the exception of the ethnocultural identity crisis, Mann-Whitney U‑tests showed that the refugees that split more during their initial period, which was on average about 2 years before, showed a significantly more integrated (U = 1.00, p < 0.001, r = −0.80), less conflicted (U = 11.50, p < 0.028, r = −0.55) and more functional identity (U = 6.00, p < 0.005, r = − 0.69) in comparison to the group that did not split as much at that time. The qualitative results further demonstrated the protective and adaptive functions of splitting. Conclusion: The refugees interviewed were able to protect their ego and their identity from flooding and decompensation by means of splitting and the nostalgic fixations as well as the transitional acts they contained. Therefore, it was possible for them to emotionally refuel through their inner object “home” in order to have more energy available for the (re)construction of intrapersonal and interpersonal identity. © 2020, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.","Acculturation; Idealisation and devaluation; Identity crisis; Integration; Nostalgia","adolescent; article; controlled study; cultural factor; female; flooding; genetic transcription; Germany; human; human experiment; interview; male; questionnaire; refugee; taxonomy",,,,,,,,"Ainslie, R., Tummala-Narra, P., Harlem, A., Contemporary psychoanalytic views on the experience of immigration (2013) Psychoanal Psychol, 30 (4), pp. 663-679; Akhtar, S., A Third Individuation: Immigration, Identity, and the Psychoanalytic Process (1995) J Am Psychoanal Assoc, 43 (4), pp. 1051-1084. , COI: 1:STN:280:DyaK28vgt1Wruw%3D%3D; Akhtar, S., The immigrant, the exile, and the experience of nostalgia (1999) J Appl Psychoanal Stud, 1 (2), pp. 123-130; Cote, J., Identity crisis modality: a technique for assessing the structure of the identity crisis (1986) J Adolesc, 9 (4), pp. 321-335. , COI: 1:STN:280:DyaL2s7htVSmsw%3D%3D; Erdogan-Ertorer, S., Managing identity in the face of resettlement (2014) Identity, 14 (4), pp. 268-285; Freud, S., Trauer und Melancholie (1917) Int Z Ärztl Psychoanal, 4, pp. 288-301; Grinberg, L., Grinberg, R., A psychoanalytic study of migration: its normal and pathological aspects (1984) J Am Psychoanal Assoc, 32 (1), pp. 13-38. , COI: 1:STN:280:DyaL2c7mtlWqtw%3D%3D; Kernberg, O., Structural derivatives of object relationships (1966) Int J Psychoanal, 47, pp. 236-252. , COI: 1:STN:280:DyaF2s7jtVaiuw%3D%3D, PID: 5964140; Kuckartz, U., (2012) Qualitative Inhaltsanalyse, , Beltz Juventa, Weinheim; Ramsden, R., Ridge, D., ‘It was the most beautiful country I have ever seen’: the role of somali narratives in adapting to a new country (2012) J Refug Stud, 26 (2), pp. 226-246; Ritchie, J., Spencer, L., Qualitative data analysis for applied policy research (2002) The qualitative researcher’s companion, pp. 305-329. , Huberman M, Miles MB, (eds), SAGE, Thousand Oaks; Roberts, S., Cote, J., The identity issues inventory: identity stage resolution in the prolonged transition to adulthood (2014) J Adult Dev, 21 (4), pp. 225-238; Streeck-Fischer, A., Borderland and Borderline: Understanding and Treating Adolescent Migrants in Crisis (2020) Adolescent Psychiatry, 9 (3), pp. 185-193; Timotijevic, L., Breakwell, G., Migration and threat to identity (2000) J Community Appl Soc, 10 (5), pp. 355-372; Utari-Witt, H., Tsunami soll Deutschland verwüsten… Destruktive Phantasien, Ambivalenzkonflikt und Spaltungsmechanismen im Migrationsprozess (2015) Unterwegs in der Fremde, pp. 61-86. , Utari-Witt, Kogan, (eds; Volkan, V., Nostalgia as a linking phenomenon (1999) J Appl Psychoanal, 1 (2), pp. 169-179; Walsh, S., Shulman, S., Splits in the self following immigration: an adaptive defense or a pathological reaction?

The educational and social inclusion of unaccompanied foreign minors poses both a challenge and a threat to current policy. Nonetheless, studies linking educational aspects to the phenomenon of the integration of these children are scarce and do not specify the most influential educational tools and strategies. In this sense, a descriptive, quantitative and cross-sectional research study is presented. The aim of this study is to examine whether variables such as age and the use of applications and social networks determine the personal learning environments (PLE) of unaccompanied foreign minors. The sample of the present study was formed by 624 individuals (♂ = 92.1% (n = 575); ♀ = 7.9% (n = 49)) aged between 8 and 17 years old. The majority came from Morocco and resided in the cities of Ceuta and Melilla. The “PLE and Social Integration of UFMs” questionnaire was used as the study instrument. Amongst the main findings, significant differences are highlighted in the personal learning environments as a function of age-related psychosocial factors as they pertain to unaccompanied foreign minors. Four factors were seen to exist in relation to the personal learning environments of unaccompanied foreign minors: self-concept of the learning process, planning and management of learning, use of resources and tools, and communication and social interaction. The same trend was observed in the four factors, with older age groups reporting better scores. On the other hand, results show that the use of applications and social networks have a significant and favourable impact on personal learning environment construction. © 2020 by the authors.

Pacific Island migrant perspectives of wellbeing and worldviews are linked to their spatial behaviour and material cultural adaptations within places like Brisbane. The characteristics of the Brisbane urban landscape create the material cultural adaptations that have been observed in diaspora contexts, including places of dwelling, community and church gatherings. They are commonly displayed during family or community events, in both private and public spaces. In order to understand the significance of material cultural adaptations we must also consider the underpinnings of the materials and templates used within context. Preliminary qualitative findings have been drawn from a wider-scale research project that has explored Pasifika migrants (of Samoan and Tongan descent) perceptions and experiences of wellbeing during 2015‒2018. This inquiry has rendered significant evidence of cultural values and identity elements originating from Samoa and Tonga and retained by generations of Brisbane-based Pacific Islanders, through adapted material culture and shared spatial behaviour. © 2020 Australian Anthropological Society","Brisbane Pasifika diaspora; cultural adaptations; material culture; Pacific Island wellbeing; spatial behaviour",,,,,,"University of Queensland, UQ

The research on US-based immigrant information behavior, however, remains scant. To understand the role of information in immigration, this study explores information overload among Black immigrants in the US. Design/methodology/approach: The researcher developed a literature-derived information overload scale to investigate participants' information access along with experiences and response to information overload. Findings: Results suggest that participants experience information overload due to behavioral (e.g. the demands of needing, seeking, or using information), quantitative (i.e. volume or length), and qualitative (e.g. authority, diversity, or urgency) indicators. Most participants mitigate information overload by turning to intermediaries and filtering resources. Research limitations/implications: The information overload scale can advance knowledge of the role of information in immigrant acculturative stress. Social implications: LIS researchers and practitioners can utilize findings to foster social inclusion and well-being among immigrants. Originality/value: Scholarship on immigrant information behavior must reflect the centrality of information in migration and how it shapes integration and acculturation. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Acculturation;

Based on qualitative interviews, we identified four inequality-related and interrelated challenges: personal relationships, housing, company culture and bureaucracy. Our findings show that MobiPro-EU, as an example of a government initiative, emphasises labour market integration and thereby neglects the cultural dimension of integration. The German-Spanish Association, which is a regional example for migrant self-support, lacks the financial means, staff and geographic scope to provide large-scale support. We conclude that both initiatives follow a different support strategy and demonstrate shortcomings in supporting migrants. As a consequence, particularly for migrants who cannot draw on social support, for instance provided by their personal networks, the absence of effective support measures can negatively affect cultural integration into society as well as career development. © 2019 The Authors.

This paper aims at deepening into this relationship by questioning to what extent some multilocal behaviours may, or not, drive to an integration at destination. To this objective, a combination of a survey questionnaire and in-depth interviews directed to North-European retirement migrants, over 50 years old, in Spain has been deployed. Variables related to multilocality are the time of annual residence in Spain, the maintenance of property in their country of origin and the number of times they travelled to their country of origin in the year before. Social integration has been measured through variables such as daily social relations, voting in municipal elections, membership in clubs and associations, registration with the local register, trust in Spanish institutions and interest in Spanish political issues. Results from the multivariate statistical analysis and qualitative research indicate that multilocality is associated with migrants’ specific social and political integration in Spain since migrants enter the receiving society unevenly. While they show a certain degree of integration, their social relations tend to stand aside from the whole Spanish population. Collected data suggest that, on the one hand, research on lifestyle migration should develop explanatory models open to the different dimensions of the integration processes, and on the other, that theory on social integration can be improved by considering contemporary mobilities as a field of research. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","International retirement migration; Lifestyle migration; Multilocality; Social integration; Spain",,,,,,"Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN","This paper is based in the MIRES project (International Retirement Migration in Spain), funded by the Ministry of Science and Innovation.

The sourcing, understanding and application of related information are important for health and this defines sexual and reproductive health literacy (SRHL). Health care utilization rates among Asylum Seekers and Refugees (ASRs) may not be high and they are unlikely to seek sufficient SRH information and care in their host countries, leaving some needs unmet. No SRHL research related to Scotland’s Asylum Seeking and Refugee Women (ASRW) exists. In this qualitative study, the purpose of this paper is to explore the SRHL-related views and experiences of adult ASRW living in Glasgow and their views on assistance required to improve their SRHL. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 14 semi-structured interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed and qualitative thematic analysis employed. Findings: Five themes and 13 sub-themes with four key findings highlighted: experience of unmet SRHL needs, similarities and differences in the source of SRH information, SRH views and behaviours influenced by cultural and religious factors, barriers and facilitators to accessing SRH information/care and developing SRHL. Research limitations/implications: This was a small scale qualitative study affording limited transferability. The work addressed a highly sensitive topic among women from conservative home country cultures. Practical implications: Routine collection of sexual and reproductive health data by the NHS should be explored for this group. NHS staff should be aware of the rights of asylum seekers, Refugees and failed asylum seekers, to NHS healthcare free at the point of delivery in Scotland (National Health Service, 2019; Scottish Government, 2018), and be well trained in the likely religious and cultural norms of these groups. Host communities should consider improving access to SRH information and care in ASRWs first languages. Social implications: The study identified weaknesses in the opportunities for social integration afforded this group and the coordination of existing social opportunities. The stigmatization of immigrants in the UK is well understood and has repercussions for many individuals and societal organizations implicated in the promotion of this. Originality/value: This paper addresses a very sensitive topic with women from conservative cultures. With few publications in this area, and none pertaining to Scotland, the paper makes a small but original contribution that might be considered a starting point for researchers and relevant services in Scotland. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Health; Scotland",,,,,,,,,"Agus, Y., Horiuchi, S., Porter, S.E., Rural Indonesia women’s traditional beliefs about antenatal care (2012) BMC Research Notes, 5 (1), pp. 1-8; Ahmed, A., Stewart, D.E., Teng, L., Wahoush, O., Gagnon, A.J., Experiences of immigrant new mothers with symptoms of depression (2008) Archives of Women’s Mental Health, 11 (4), pp. 295-303; Allsopp, J., Sigona, N., Phillimore, J., (2014) Poverty among refugees and asylum seekers in the UK, an evidence and policy review, , www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/college-social-sciences/social-policy/iris/2014/working-paper-series/IRIS-WP-1-2014.pdf, Institute for Research into Superdiversity, University of Birmingham, Birmingham: (accessed, 27 August 2019; Asif, S., Baugh, A., Jones, N.W., The obstetric care of asylum seekers and refugee women in the UK (2015) The Obstetrician & Gynaecologist, 17, pp. 223-231; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3 (2), pp. 77-101; (2019) Press release-UK asylum system leaving thousands of people in poverty, , www.redcross.org.uk/about-us/news-and-media/media-centre/press-releases/press-release-uk-asylum-system-leaving-thousands-of-people-in-poverty, (accessed, 27 August 2019; Bulman, M., (2017) Thousands of asylum seekers and migrants wrongly denied NHS healthcare, , www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/asylum-seekers-migrants-wrongly-denied-nhs-healthcare-cancer-doctors-phil-murwill-a7672686.html#comments, (accessed, 2 July 2018; Clark-Kazak, C., Ethical considerations: research with people in situations of forced migration (2017) Refuge: Canada’s Journal on Refugees/Refuge: Revue Canadienne Sur les Réfugiés, 33 (2), pp. 11-17; Drew, N., A return to husserl and researcher self-awareness (1999) Perspectives on Philosophy of Science in Nursing, pp. 263-272. , Polifroni, E.C. and Welch, M.,(Eds), Lippincott, Philadelphia, PA; (2018) EU Member States granted protection to more than half a million asylum seekers in 2017, , http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/8817675/3-19042018-AP-EN.pdf/748e8fae-2cfb-4e75-a388-f06f6ce8ff58, (accessed, 17 May 2018; Fortenberry, J.D., Mcfarlane, M.M., Hennessy, M., Relation of health literacy to gonorrhoea related care (2001) Sexually Transmitted Infections, 77 (3), pp. 206-211; (2007) Sexual health, asylum seekers and refugees.

Design/methodology/approach: During the process of translation and cultural adaptation of the subjective well-being assessment scale in the target population, the model of measurement presented some weakness with regard to content validity criteria. Findings: This leads to a partial revision of the model and the development of new locally-based domains of SWB. Originality/value: Context-specific factors’ robustness showed the dynamic and culture-informed nature of the SWB construct. Practical and theoretical implications of using quantitative questionnaires in non-western contexts characterized by high grades of insecurity and instability will be discussed. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","IDPs; Mental health; Subjective well-being",,,,,,,,,"Adepoju, A., Migration in West Africa (2003) Development, 46 (3), pp. 37-41; Guidelines for psychological evaluations in child protection matters (2013) The American Psychologist, 68 (1), pp. 20-31; Andersson, R., (2014) Illegality, Inc.: Clandestine Migration and the Business of Bordering Europe, , University of California Press, Oakland, CA; Barnett, J.P., Maticka-Tyndale, E., Kenya, T., Stigma as social control: gender-based violence stigma, life chances, and moral order in Kenya (2016) Social Problems, 63 (3), pp. 447-462; Bello, B.M., Fatusi, A.O., Adepoju, O.E., Maina, B.W., Kabiru, C.W., Sommer, M., Mmari, K., Adolescent and parental reactions to puberty in Nigeria and Kenya: a cross-cultural and intergenerational comparison (2017) Journal of Adolescent Health, 61 (4), pp. S35-S41; Bohnke, J.R., Croudace, T.J., Calibrating well-being, quality of life and common mental disorder items: psychometric epidemiology in public mental health research (2016) British Journal of Psychiatry, 209, pp. 162-168; Briggs, L., Macleod, A., Demoralization-a useful conceptualization of non-specific psychological distress among refugees attending mental health services (2006) International Journal of Social Psychiatry, 52 (6), pp. 512-524; Campbell, D.T., Fiske, D.W., Convergent and discriminant validation by the multitrait multimethod matrix (1959) Psychological Bulletin, 56 (2), pp. 81-105; Carlsson, J.M., Mortensen, E.L., Kastrup, M., A follow-up study of mental health and health-related quality of life in tortured refugees in multidisciplinary treatment (2005) The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 193 (10), pp. 651-657; Chan, J., Young, M., Sharif, N., Well-being after trauma: a review of posttraumatic growth among refugees (2016) Canadian Psychology, 57 (2), pp. 291-299; Chase, E., Unaccompanied asylum seeking children: the response of social work services (2006) Child & Family Social Work, 11 (4), p. 380; Christie, K., Introduction: migration, refugees and human security in the twenty-first century (2018) Migration, Refugees and Human Security in the Mediterranean and MENA, pp. 3-19. , Boulby, M. and Christie, K.,(Eds), Palgrave Macmillan, Cham; Chukwuorji, J.C., Ifeagwazi, C.M., Eze, J.E., Role of event centrality and emotion regulation in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms among internally displaced persons (2017) Anxiety, Stress, & Coping, 30 (6), pp. 702-715; Cox, P., March-McDonald, J., Challenges in meeting the mental health and wellbeing needs of refugee children and young people in England: evaluation and critique of policy and guidance (2019) Refugee Migration and Health, pp. 195-203. , Krämer, A. and Fischer, F. and,(Eds), Migration, Minorities and Modernity, 4, Springer, Cham; Cronbach, L., Meehl, P., Construct validity in psychological tests (1955) Psychological Bulletin, 52 (4), pp. 281-302; De Anstiss, H., Ziaian, T., Procter, N., Warland, J., Baghurst, P., Help-seeking for mental health problems in young refugees: a review of the literature with implications for policy, practice, and research (2009) Transcultural Psychiatry, 46 (4), pp. 584-607; Duncan, D.T., Goedel, W.C., Chunara, R., Quantitative methods for measuring neighborhood characteristics in neighborhood health research (2018) Neighborhoods and Health, pp. 57-90. , Oxford University Press; Ehntholt, K.A., Yule, W., Practitioner review: assessment and treatment of refugee children and adolescents who have experienced war-related trauma (2006) Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 47, pp. 1197-1210; Fangen, K., Humiliation experienced by Somali refugees in Norway (2006) Journal of Refugee Studies, 19 (1), pp. 69-93; Fazel, M., Betancourt, T.S., Preventive mental health interventions for refugee children and adolescents in high-income settings (2018) The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health, 2 (2), pp. 121-132; Feyissa, A., Horn, R., There is more than one way of dying: an Ethiopian perspective on the effects of long- term tays in refugee camps (2008) Refugee Rights: Ethics, Advocacy and Africa, pp. 13-26. , Hollenbach, D.

Therefore, sexual and reproductive health (SRH) surveys are needed to provide accurate and comparable indicators to identify and address SRH inequalities, with specific focus on under researched aspects, such as the interrelation between migration and gender. FEMINA (FErtility, MIgratioN and Acculturation) aims to investigate intersectional SRH inequalities among Cape Verdean immigrant and Portuguese native families and how they impact on fertility in Portugal. This study will use a comprehensive approach exploring simultaneously the components of SRH, namely regarding identities, perceptions and practices of both women and men among lay people and relevant experts and stakeholders. The project has three main goals: 1) to identify social determinants of SRH among Cape Verdean immigrant and Portuguese native men and women of reproductive age; 2) to gain understanding of the diversity of the sexual and reproductive experiences and expectations of Cape Verdean immigrant and Portuguese native men and women of reproductive age, considering the singularities of their migratory, social and family dynamics; and 3) to produce recommendations for policy makers, employers and service providers on how to better address the SRH needs of Portuguese-born and immigrant populations. Methods: The study will address these goals using a mixed methods approach, including: a cross-sectional telephone survey with a probabilistic sample of 600 Cape Verdean immigrant and 600 Portuguese native women and men (women aged 18 to 49 and men aged 18 to 54), residents of the Greater Lisbon Area; a qualitative research through in-depth interviews with a subsample of 30 Cape Verdean immigrants and 30 Portuguese native men and women; and a Delphi technique for finding consensus on good practices in SRH for the entire population with a special emphasis on immigrants, namely extra-EU migrants. Discussion: Data will be used to produce a comprehensive set of indicators to monitor SRH in Portugal, to foster a greater understanding of its specificities and challenges to policy and decision makers, and to provide targeted recommendations to promote inclusive and migrant sensitive SRH services. © 2019 The Author(s).","Acculturation; Fertility; Immigrants; Intersectionality; Qualitative research; Sexual and reproductive health inequalities; Survey","adult; article; consensus; controlled study; cultural factor; Delphi study; employer; expectation; female; fertility; human; human experiment; immigrant; layperson; major clinical study; male; perception; Portugal; qualitative research; reproductive health; resident; social determinants of health; telephone interview; adolescent; attitude to health; middle aged; migration; reproductive health; sexual health; socioeconomics; young adult; Acculturation; Adolescent; Adult; Female; Fertility; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Reproductive Health; Sexual Health; Socioeconomic Factors; Transients and Migrants; Young Adult",,,,,"Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT

These changes have been taking place forever, and continue at an increasing pace as more and more peoples of different cultures move, meet and interact. Variations in the meanings of the concept, and some systematic conceptualisations of it are presented. This is followed by a survey of empirical work with indigenous, immigrant and ethnocultural peoples around the globe that employed both ethnographic (qualitative) and psychological (quantitative) methods. This wide-ranging research has been undertaken in a quest for possible general principles (or universals) of acculturation. This Element concludes with a short evaluation of the field of acculturation; its past, present and future. © John W. Berry 2019.

We focus on the role of Majority World migrants to the Minority World. Large-scale survey research into EVKB is beginning to consider both ethnicity and migration history as important variables, but tends to leave the concepts of environment and environmental behaviour unexamined. Western EVKB indicators thus tend to be universalized rather than understood as themselves culturally specific. An emergent literature attempts to improve both quantitative and qualitative research on EVKB by broadening the conceptualization of environmental behaviour to include the practices of Majority World migrants. Those studies throw new light on the process of acculturation as having disruptive or solidifying potential for sustainable practices. We summarize four implications for future research. There is a need to go beyond western logics in research design and method. Straightforward assumptions about the ‘pro’ in pro-environmental behaviour need to be challenged. Cases of EVKB’s persistence post-migration and positive influence on the broader population should be sought out and examined. The migration process provides real-time experiments in enacting alternative worlds. © The Author(s) 2018.","climate change; cultures of nature; environment; ethnicity; immigration; sustainability","behavioral response; climate change; conceptual framework; environmental values; ethnicity; immigration; knowledge; sustainability",,,,,"Australian Research Council: DP140101165

In addition, social integration offered an opportunityfor elderly migrants to express their identity at the newplace to which they had moved. © 2019 Common Ground Research Networks, Ittipong Thongsrikate, Dusadee Ayuwat, Saowalak Chaytaweep.","Elderly Migrants; Social Integration",,,,,,,,,"Berry, J.W., Mutual attitudes among immigrants and ethnocultural groups in Canada (2006) International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 30 (6), pp. 719-734; Brown, P., Active aging: Roles of the aged groups and 'capitals' utilized in elderly care movement (2014) Humanities and Social Sciences, 31 (3), pp. 97-120; Bruner, J., (1986) Actual Minds, Possible Worlds, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Bunyanuphong, K., Bunyanuphong, S., Chanta, S., (1990) The Life of the Elderly in Chiang Mai Province, , Chiang Mai, Thailand: Chiang Mai University, Social Research Institute; Chaisingkananont, S., Aging, image, and life in city (2002) In Chiwitchaikhob-Tuaton Kab Kwammhai [Marginal Life: Self-Identity and Meaning], pp. 138-183. , edited by Paritta Chalermpow Koanantakun,Bangkok, Thailand: Ammarin Printing; Chamratrithirong, A., Punpuing, S., Holumyong, C., Chamchan, C., Apipornchaisakul, K., Kaikeaw, S., The typology of social integration of cross border migrant workers in Thailand (2016) In Population and Social 2016 Thailand in the Era of Transnational Migration, pp. 55-69. , edited by S.

It is an exploratory, qualitative and ethnographic case study. The research focuses on the relation between literary reading and writing. The study was conducted at the school library in an Infant and Primary School during a school year with a group of six immigrant mothers. The findings show that the shared reading of literary text in a cozy context favors the development of attitudes towards written culture. The reading diary is used to make shared readings memorable, as well as an instrument of language appropriation. On the other hand, it shows the need for the informants to write to tell their own life experiences in the host language. Finally, the relationship between literary reading and writing is confirmed. © 2019 Centro de Estudios de PromociÃ³n de la Lectura y Literatura Infantil, Universidad de Castilla-La Manc.

Given that the range of action usually decreases in later life, the living environment around the place of residence plays an important role in the social integration of the older generation. Hence, spatial patterns of residence indicate the extent of opportunities for the older population to engage in urban life and, therefore, need to be addressed by urban planning and policy. The aim of this article is to study the interrelation between diversity in later life—in terms of migrant history, gender, social class, and age—as well as planned and actual (past) movements of elders. We have chosen Berlin as a case study and draw from a quantitative survey with elders (age 60+) from diverse backgrounds (N = 427). Our results from descriptive analysis and statistical hypothesis tests show that age impacts people’s past and planned movement; we observe a peak in the decisions to move at the age of 65–75 and a drop in the inclination to move among people over 80. None of the other factors is similarly influential, but we observe appreciable tendencies regarding the impact of gender and social class on planned movements. Our study suggests that variables other than classic socio-demographic data, such as apartment size, rent, social networks, and health, and their interrelations may offer a promising starting point for achieving a full picture of older people’s movement behaviour. © 2019 by the authors.","Ageing cities; Berlin; Diversity; Elders; Moving behaviour; Survey; Urban planning",,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: HA 3484/ 8-1, HE 2417/16-1","Funding was provided by the German Research Foundation (DFG, Project number HE 2417/16-1 and HA 3484/ 8-1).

This article discusses the processes of training and accompaniment in these enterprises within the framework of the research ""Educational, accompanying, qualification and personal developmental processes in Work Integration Enterprises: innovating social inclusion through employment,"" funded by the Spanish government (EDU2013- 45919-R). WISEs take part in the social economy. Upon the principle of solidarity, they intend to promote training and social inclusion through employment, and they have proved particularly effective in the integration of women and people of migrant origin back into the ordinary labour market. Different social balance reports show the contribution of WISEs both in individual terms as well as in society as a whole. By focusing on people with low levels of employability, WISEs try to improve such levels and they do so by trying to foster employability at the individual level as well as by providing networks of support to improve the contextual dimensions behind it. The organization of WISEs conceives of two different roles in order to support workers with integration contracts. These are the productive role and the accompanying role, and in some cases, they fall under the same workers, while in certain companies they are held by different workers, known as Production Workers (PTP is its Spanish acronym) and Accompanying Workers (PTA being its Spanish acronym). It is about these two roles that we have written our article, with the aim of identifying where training and accompanying support rely on WISEs and how they are performed within them. Design/methodology/approach Our analysis is based on qualitative fieldwork consisting of observation, interviews and assessment of the data obtained in terms of job performance and personal and social development that were carried out over a 3-year period in eight enterprises in Spain.Our research has a longitudinal research approach, as we intended to follow up the progress in terms of learning, employability and personal and professional autonomy of workers with integration contracts. For the purpose of this article, we have used a sample of eight WISEs in seven regions in Spain, in which we have conducted on-the-job observation of 39 workers with integration contracts, 9 accompanying workers and 18 production workers as a whole. A brief description of each of the companies is given in the article in order to provide understanding of their most relevant contextual and organizational dimensions, while guaranteeing anonymity. This means we observed the work of 39 workers and conducted interviews of 66 workers between 2015 and 2017. We visited one of those companies four times during this period, and all the remaining 7 companies three times. Between one visit and the following one there was a period varying from 7 to 14 months. Companies work in the sectors of recycling, restaurant and catering, industrial laundry and personal care and cleaning services. We developed our own research tools by designing the procedures to gather information. Our sources were documentation of the companies and files of the integration workers, including their assessment of employability as well as their individualized suggested action plan; non-participant observation of the workplace during a full working day on at least three occasions across three years; semi-structured interviews of integration workers, their accompanying workers and production workers after every observation; questionnaires to measure their employability at individual levels, as well as a questionnaire to assess the ability of the WISE to foster employability at a contextual level. For the purpose of this article, most information comes from on-the-job observation and interviews; the guideline for observation of accompanying and training practices is provided as an annex to the article. The protocol for observation was prepared and explained in the months prior to the beginning of the fieldwork and was approved by the research ethics committee of the University of Valencia to conduct research with human beings. In every visit to the companies we conducted observation of two to five integration workers in the company, and we produced an individual report on each of them which entailed information from documentation and interviews with the workers and the corresponding accompanying and production workers. These reports were written by the person in charge of the visit and validated by a second researcher within the team. Before the end of the research, a summary report was submitted to the staff in the WISE to ask for their amendment and validation. Results Our analysis shows results in terms of principles, roles and difficulties in the performance of the accompanying role while accomplishing production aims of the companies. This allowed us to identify both organizational and personal variables that show differences in the ways such roles are performed and to what extent they differ from the ideal model set by the handbooks guiding such practices.First, at the organizational level we have identified a variety of structures within WISEs in terms of the resources made available to support integration workers. Therefore, accompanying practice is not just the result of a pedagogical relation between the integration worker and the production and accompanying workers, but also the effect of the training and labour opportunities that the company allows the integration worker to engage in. Second, the management of the working team is another key dimension in the performance of accompanying practices, given that coordination is the key to the proper functioning of the companies, where production and accompanying processes rest upon different workers. Third, relations between accompanying and production workers are a fundamental dimension in the organization of WISEs. This is particularly the case where the accompanying worker is not present in daily working activities. Therefore, communication and coordination among different roles and workers in the company are even more relevant than the use of specific tools for the purpose of accompanying integration workers. Limitations and implications The process of research was altered for several reasons: On the side of the company, there were delays and last-minute cancelations in visits to the companies, due to production processes; visits had to be adjusted to those moments that the workload allowed for external people to be observing and conducting interviews. In some cases, there was also a delay in facilitating relevant documentation and, in a few cases, the company denied us access to such information. On the side of the research team, there was a delay in writing some of the visit reports and this caused loss of information across time. Some visits were also delayed due to the inability of the researchers to attend the companies on the suggested dates, and this was so because we prioritised the possibility of having one researcher as the reference for the fieldwork in every company. Conclusions Our conclusion points towards the most relevant dimensions that affect the performance of the accompaniment and the way in which the employability of integration workers is promoted. Most accompanying processes are individualized and they try to serve the demands of each integration worker, which turns out positive in terms of facilitating the process within the WISE, though it becomes a difficulty in terms of transition into the ordinary labour market.Such personalization practices correspond to the idiosyncrasy of every WISE in devising and using its own assessment and promotion tools, in such a way that ownership is more relevant than standardization of practices. This results in personal styles having a greater impact than agreedupon procedures on the support of integration workers. Participation, autonomy, personalization and socialization are dealt with in very different ways even within every single company. Therefore, the complexity of training and accompanying processes increases, which corresponds to the lack of a common initial training background among practitioners. In those cases where accompanying and production roles lie with different people, which is the case for most of the companies in our sample, close coordination is required and the involvement of the manager of the company is also necessary in order to make accompanying processes effective. Original value Our research has focused upon training and accompanying processes in WISEs and it is pioneering in such matter. We have identified the most relevant dimensions that affect the performance of the accompaniment and the way in which the employability of integration workers is promoted. The recording and analysis of the interactions between production and accompanying processes has brought to the forefront discussions on the extent to which WISEs are a kind of company within the social economy with a close eye on training and processes to foster employability of their workers. © 2018 CIRIEC-España.En el contexto actual de crisis socioeconómica y extendida precarización laboral, las empresas de inserción destacan entre las políticas activas de empleo por su potencial para luchar contra la exclusión de personas con dificultades de integración sociolaboral fomentando su empleabilidad y su calidad de vida. Este artículo analiza los procesos de formación y acompañamiento en estas empresas en el marco de la investigación ""Procesos de formación, acompañamiento, cualificación y desarrollo personal en empresas de inserción: innovación en la inclusión social desde el empleo"", financiada por el Gobierno de España. Para ello, describimos el desempeño profesional del personal de acompañamiento aludiendo a las funciones que lleva a cabo el personal técnico de acompañamiento y el de producción. Nos detenemos también en las dificultades que se encuentran en el desempeño de su rol. Este análisis se fundamenta en un trabajo cualitativo de observación, entrevistas y valoración de los resultados obtenidos en términos de desempeño laboral y desarrollo personal y social realizado a lo largo de tres años en ocho empresas del territorio español. La conclusión apunta hacia las dimensiones más relevantes que inciden en el desempeño del acompañamiento y la forma en que se promueve la empleabilidad del personal en inserción. © 2018 CIRIEC-España.","Economía social; Empresas sociales; Formación en el puesto de trabajo; Integración social1; Social Economy; Social enterprises; Social integration; Workplace learning",,,,,,,,,"Abietar, M., Marhuenda, F., Navas, A., ""Rethinking Social Justice Discourses among Stakeholders"" (2013) III International Conference on Vulnerable Workers and Precarious Work, , Toulouse (France), 12-13 sep. 2013; (2016) Informe 2015 sobre las entidades recuperadoras de AERESS, Madrid: AERESS, , AERESS & FAEDEI (2014): El acompañamiento en las empresas de inserción, Madrid: FAEDEI/AERESS; Alonso, I., Funes, J., ""L'acompanyament social en els recursos socioeducatius"" Educació social (2009) Revista d'intervenció socioeducativa, 42, pp. 27-45; Alonso, L.E., (2001) Trabajo y posmodernidad: el empleo débil, , Madrid: Fundamentos; Alonso, L.E., Fernandez Rodriguez, C.J., (2013) Los discursos del presente, , Un análisis de los imaginarios sociales contemporáneos, Madrid: Siglo XXI; Aretxabala, M.E., Setien, M.L., ""Inclusión sociolaboral: inmigrantes internacionales y mujeres en puestos de inserción en Euskadi"" (2015) Zerbitzuan: Gizarte zerbitzuetarako aldizkaria = Revista de servicios sociales, 59, pp. 51-62; Chisvert, M.J., Córdoba, A., ""Validation and accreditation of qualifications and citizenship: a method to guarantee social equity in Spain"" (2017) Vocational education beyond skill formation: VET between civic, industrial and market tensions, pp. 319-342. , In: F.

The role of self-identity as a Muslim, dietary acculturation in the host culture, moral obligation to purchase Halal meat, and trust on the authenticity of Halal meat is explored. A quantitative research methodology using an online questionnaire survey was used. Cross-sectional data were collected through a survey of 464 Muslims originating from Turkey and currently living in Germany. A positive personal attitude toward the consumption of Halal meat, motivation to comply others, the perceived control over consuming Halal meat, and the availability of Halal meat predict the intention to eat Halal meat among Muslims. This study is one of the few studies investigating the determinants of Halal meat consumption in a Muslim population in Germany using the TPB within a food, religion, and migration context. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.","Dietary acculturation; Germany; Islam; meat; moral obligation",,,,,,,,,"Abd-Latif, I., Mohamed, Z., Sharifuddin, J., Abdullah, A., Ismail, M., A comparative analysis of global halal certification requirements (2014) Journal of Food Products Marketing, 20 (1), pp. 85-101; Abdul, M., Ismail, H., Hashim, H., Johari, J., Consumer decision making process in shopping for Halal food in Malaysia (2009) China-USA Business Review, 8 (9), pp. 40-47; Abu-Hussin, M.F., Johari, F., Hehsan, A., Nawawi, M.S.A.B.M., Halal purchase intention among the Singaporean Muslim minority (2016) Journal of Food Products Marketing, 23 (7), pp. 769-782; Ahmed, A., Marketing of Halal meat in the United Kingdom–Supermarkets versus local shops (2008) British Food Journal, 110 (7), pp. 655-670; Ahmed, Z.U., Al-Kwifi, O.S., Saiti, B., Othman, N.B., Consumer behavior dynamics of Chinese minorities (2014) Journal of Technology Management in China, 9 (1), pp. 6-23; Ajzen, I., From intentions to actions: A theory of planned behavior (1985) Springer Series in Social Psychology, pp. 11-39. , Kuhl J., Beckmann J., (eds), Berlin: Springer,.

This paper aims to systematically review the existing literature on the association between acculturation and Hispanics’ breastfeeding behaviors. Methods The systematic search used major databases such as Medline and PubMed, and it followed the PRISMA checklist. The scientific quality of the studies was rated using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. Results We identified 1943 potential citations, of which 18 studies met the eligibility criteria. Overall, while 13 studies suggested that high-acculturated Hispanics were less likely to breastfeed compared with low-acculturated, five studies did not find significant evidence of such an association. Moreover, 12 studies used a static measure or a linear scale, which is not optimal; only three studies utilized bi/multidimensional scales to assess acculturation. Intention to breastfeed was examined in six studies, but the results were inconsistent. Breastfeeding initiation was examined in 11 studies, and two out of eight studies that examined breastfeeding duration, specifically analyzed exclusive breastfeeding at 6 months. Discussion Our results agree with the general hypothesis that higher acculturation is inversely related to breastfeeding rates, independently of income. Researchers used different methodologies to study acculturation and breastfeeding practices, limiting our ability to reach more detailed conclusions. Owing to the lack of a standard methodology for measuring acculturation, future studies should utilize bi/multidimensional scales when studying breastfeeding, in particular, in relation to breastfeeding intention and exclusive breastfeeding at 6 months; preferably according to Hispanic subgroups. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Acculturation; Breastfeeding; Hispanics; Systematic review","adult; breast feeding; cultural factor; ethnology; female; Hispanic; human; migrant; psychology; United States; Acculturation; Adult; Breast Feeding; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Hispanic Americans; Humans; United States",,,,,,,,"Ahluwalia, I.B., D’Angelo, D., Morrow, B., McDonald, J.A., Association between acculturation and breastfeeding among Hispanic women: Data from the pregnancy risk assessment and monitoring system (2012) Journal of Human Lactation: Official Journal of International Lactation Consultant Association, 28 (2), pp. 167-173; Anderson, A.K., Damio, G., Himmelgreen, D.A., Peng, Y.K., Segura-Perez, S., Perez-Escamilla, R., Social capital, acculturation, and breastfeeding initiation among Puerto Rican women in the United States (2004) Journal of Human Lactation: Official Journal of International Lactation Consultant Association, 20 (1), pp. 39-45; Andrews, A.R., 3rd, Bridges, A.J., Gomez, D., A multi-study analysis of conceptual and measurement issues related to health research on acculturation in latinos (2013) Journal of Transcultural Nursing, 24 (2), pp. 134-143; Arandia, G., Nalty, C., Sharkey, J.R., Dean, W.R., Diet and acculturation among Hispanic/Latino older adults in the United States: A review of literature and recommendations (2012) Journal of Nutrition in Gerontology and Geriatrics, 31 (1), pp. 16-37; Balcazar, H., Trier, C.M., Cobas, J.A., What predicts breastfeeding intention in Mexican-American and non-Hispanic white women?

The complexities of immigrant experiences are essential to unpacking and addressing the impact of acculturative processes on observed racial, ethnic, and class-based health disparities in the United States. These insights because they are largely unexplored are best captured qualitatively through academic-community research partnership. We established the participatory mixed method Little Village participatory community health assessment (CHA) to explore community health in an ethnic enclave. In this paper, we share findings from our qualitative component exploring: how do Residents in a Predominately Immigrant Neighborhood Perceive Community Health Needs and Assets in Little Village. Three major themes emerged: rich, health promoting community assets inherent in the ethnic enclave; cumulative chronic stress impacting the mental health of families and intra-familial strain; and, work and occupation as important but underappreciated community health determinants in an immigrant neighborhood. These nuanced findings enhanced our community health assessment and contributed to the development of two additional tailored CHA methods, a community member-administered Community Health Survey, and an oral history component that provided deeper insight on the community’s health needs and assets, and a focus for action on work as a social determinant of health at the community level. Conducting trusted community-driven health assessments that are adaptive and flexible to capture authentic needs and assets are critical, given health consequences of the new anti-immigrant rhetoric and growing socio-political tensions and fear in immigrant neighborhoods in the United States. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Community; Health inequalities; Health promotion; Immigration","adult; article; chronic stress; family stress; fear; female; health promotion; human; human experiment; Illinois; immigrant; immigration; male; mental health; neighborhood; occupation; public health; resident; social determinants of health; tension; adolescent; cultural factor; demography; ethnology; health survey; Illinois; mental stress; Mexican American; middle aged; migrant; needs assessment; organization and management; participatory research; qualitative research; socioeconomics; trust; United States; young adult; Acculturation; Adolescent; Adult; Chicago; Community-Based Participatory Research; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Mexican Americans; Middle Aged; Needs Assessment; Qualitative Research; Residence Characteristics; Socioeconomic Factors; Stress, Psychological; Trust; United States; Young Adult",,,,,"IPCE-12013

It employs a qualitative approach and functionalism perspective of mass media by sending questionnaires to voluntary respondents. The findings show sharing similar background and/or having experiences in the Middle Eastern countries highly influence the perspective of photojournalists on Syrian refugees. The encoding process covers through research of priority issues, target audience, trustworthiness of photos, and audience interpretation. The distribution method includes taking advantages of personal social media to promote the links of photos. As part of mass media industry, photojournalists play a crucial role to contribute to social integration, particularly, in creating a shared understanding between European community and Syrian refugees. The current research serves as a basis to future investigations on the perspective of European community towards Syrian refugees, whether or not their perspective is influenced by such photos. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Encoding (symbols); Signal encoding; Encoding process; European community; Mass media; Qualitative approach; Shared understanding; Social integrations; Social media; Target audience; Surveys",,,,,,,,"Fargues, P., Europe Must take on its Share of the SYrian Refugee Burden, but How?

A sample of immigrant women (N = 246) with original nativity of Southeast Asian countries and Taiwanese-born women sample (N = 201) was recruited from December 2008 to December 2009. Their depressive symptoms, acculturative stresses and family functioning were assessed by a series of questionnaires. Immigrant women had lower depressive scores than their native-born counterparts when other potential confounders were controlled for in the multiple regression model. Our findings suggest that the healthy immigrant effect exists among immigrant women in Taiwan. Although such effect may due to immigrant women is a highly selective population with hardy mental characteristics, it is crucial to improve immigrant women’s mental health by helping them to enhance the ability of expressing emotions between family members as well as by mitigating socioeconomic inequality of cross-cultural immigrant families. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Acculturative stress; Depressive symptoms; Family functioning; Health immigrant effect; Immigrant","Asian continental ancestry group; cultural factor; depression; ethnology; female; human; interview; marriage; mental stress; migrant; psychology; qualitative research; questionnaire; regression analysis; Southeast Asia; Taiwan; women's health; Acculturation; Asia, Southeastern; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Depression; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Marriage; Qualitative Research; Regression Analysis; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; Women's Health",,,,,"Changhua Christian Hospital, CCH

It considers that social participation in organizations promoted by migrants implies social integration and favors political involvement. This political participation is divided into two elements: the right of access to decision making and effective participation, which is understood as contacts, associative practices and relationships with social and political actors. A mixed methodology is used combining data drawn from a questionnaire and the analysis of qualitative interviews. From the questionnaire administered to immigrant organizations in Galicia, we obtained quantitative data on the activities and institutional and political relations of 32 immigrant associations. The 43 semi-structured interviews of association leaders, institutional representatives and third sector entities allows us to look deeper into the discourses that support their actions and their ideological-political position. The main results point to a political participation of foreigners’ organizations circumscribed to the local sphere, as well as to the existence of formal mechanisms that allow their consideration as social actors but with scarce political incidence characterized by little contact with political and social entities. When this occurs, it is more aimed at solving needs derived from social vulnerability rather than the typical demands of a consolidated settlement process. © 2018, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona.

Based on survey data and quantitative analyses (general linear models), TPSOC and EPSOC were considered first separately and then combined, according to a bidimensional model of MPSOC that resulted in four combinations (dual membership, receiving society membership, ethnic membership, and no membership). The findings highlighted significant variations across groups. Among Albanian participants, both TPSOC and EPSOC were positively associated with integration and negatively with marginalization. Dual membership was positively associated with integration, prevailing ethnic membership with separation, and no membership with marginalization. Among Sri Lankan participants, EPSOC showed a positive association with separation. Dual membership was associated with marginalization, prevailing receiving society membership with assimilation, prevailing ethnic membership with separation, and no membership with integration. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"adult; Albanian (citizen); behavior; conceptual framework; cultural factor; female; human; immigrant; Italy; major clinical study; male; psychological model; quantitative analysis; Sri Lankan",,,,,,,,"Admiraal, W., Lockhorst, D., The Sense of Community in School Scale (SCSS) (2012) Journal of Workplace Learning, 4, pp. 245-255; Anderson, B., (1987) Imagined communities: Reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism, , 4th ed., London, Vers; Arnett, J.J., The psychology of globalization (2002) American Psychologist, 57, pp. 774-783. , https://doi.org/10.1037//0003-066X.57.10.774; Bacciocchi, L., (2010) Tra Sri Lanka e Italia.

Design - Multi-site case study. Setting - Public libraries in Oslo, Moss, and Horten, Norway. Subjects - Language café participants (immigrants and Norwegian-born volunteers). Methods - Participant observation and questionnaires for immigrants (Norwegian, English, Somali, and Arabic language versions) and volunteers (Norwegian language only) who took part in café activities. Main Results - 64 immigrants (21 in Oslo, 30 in Moss, 13 in Horten) and 31 volunteers (7 in Oslo, 14 in Moss, 10 in Horton) completed questionnaires. Language cafés at all three sites led to informal, respectful discursive interaction between participants. Though each café had a unique set of participants and conversational topics, all cafés enabled immigrants to improve their Norwegian language skills while providing all particiwith a place to meet new people, exchange information, and discuss political issues. Conclusion - Having attended the cafés and improved their knowledge of Norwegian language and culture, immigrants at all three sites were potentially better equipped for future participation in the Norwegian public sphere. Commentary While public libraries in many countries still debate the extent to which they should participate in the political process (Jaeger, Bertot, & Gorham, 2013), Norway's 2014 Library Act provides a mandate for public libraries to actively foster public discussion and debate. Conversation-based programs in public libraries, including language cafés, support this mandate by providing neutral fora for participation in the so-called Habermasian public sphere. This study contributes qualitative richness to prior examinations of the public sphere and public libraries summarized by Widdersheim & Masanori (2016). Tangentially, the study also adds to the broader corpus of social scientific investigations about immigration and multicultural societies. For example, the study describes specific aspects of Norway's approach to social integration of immigrants that may be useful to researchers who study how national integration policies differ (Alba & Foner, 2014). The study achieves the three primary aims of case study research-generality, accuracy, and complexity/coverage (Woodside, 2010, pp. 19-20)-but only in relation to the specific question Do language cafés facilitate discourse in settings where immigrants must learn a new language? The study is not longitudinal in scope and does not investigate whether or not immigrants, armed with new language and cultural skills, actually do participate in the political process following participation in a language café. Future researchers may wish to pursue this question. At the theoretical level, generality is strengthened with the universally applicable, in-depth discussion of the concept of the public sphere applied to multicultural settings, including descriptions of so-called weak/strong publics and social capital (Putnam, 2005). This supranational ""theoretical anchoring"" provides any public library, anywhere, with a conceptual roadmap for advocating conversation-based programming. In terms of the case study itself, conducting research at multiple sites and gathering data with three mechanisms were strategies employed for ensuring adequate accuracy and complexity/coverage. In future presentations of this research, it would be helpful to include the questionnaire for volunteers as an appendix (even in the original Norwegian), which was missing in this study. Additionally, while the discussion of findings includes highly relevant questionnaire responses and field note excerpts, numeric data about questionnaire responses would enable readers to understand the study more completely. As an illustration, the authors note ""the vast majority of participants reported they think attending the language café has improved their language skills somewhat or a lot"" (p. 7), but the phrase ""vast majority"" is open to interpretation by different readers. Summarizing this statement with a specific percentage would clarify meaning. Overall, this study provides public libraries with examples of how conversation-based programs can enrich civic dialogues. Rich in theory, the study also provides conceptual ammunition for public libraries wishing to engage more actively in political discourse for use in defending democratic discussion in hostile environments. © 2018 Krueger.",,,,,,,,,,"Alba, R., Foner, N., Comparing immigrant integration in North America and Western Europe: How much do the grand narratives tell us?

Participants also had the opportunity to provide qualitative statements to elaborate on their survey responses. Contrary to existing literature, survey analyses showed that Black Americans generally perceived African immigrants as integrated. More than half of the domains were found to be under the separation acculturation strategy. In addition, integration was the strategy most preferred. Marginalization was not an acculturation strategy that Black Americans observed or wanted. Within-subject ANOVAs revealed main effects of domain, perceptions (vs. preferences), but not for culture. Analysis of the qualitative statements expanded the quantitative findings, not only highlighting the places Black Americans perceive difference, but also emphasizing their hope for African immigrant acculturation to and alliance with their culture. The emphasis on Black Americans as the host culture provides an alternative but much-needed view on immigrant acculturation, adding nuance to the long-standing narrative of contention between these two groups. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","acculturation; African immigrants; Black Americans; immigration; interethnic relations; Relative Acculturation Extended Model","adult; African American; controlled study; cultural factor; female; human; immigrant; immigration; major clinical study; male; narrative; perception; race relation; social interaction",,,,,,,,"Alex-Assensoh, Y.M., African immigrants and African-Americans: An analysis of voluntary African immigration and the evolution of Black ethnic politics in America (2009) African and Asian Studies, 8, pp. 89-124; Anderson, M., (2015) African immigrant population in U.S. steadily climbs, , http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/02/african-immigrant-population-in-u-s-steadily-climbs/, November, 2, Pew Research Center,.

Although it is commonly defined as a two-way process with changes occurring among both minority members and majority members, surprisingly little research has focused on the acculturation of majority members. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative data, the present study attempted to fill this gap by exploring how and how much majority members change because of exposure to immigrant cultures. In the first part, using an open-response format, majority members reported positive as well as negative cultural change across a broad range of life domains. Most changes were reported in the private as compared to public sphere, and in terms of behaviours rather than values. Second, based on their responses to quantitative acculturation scales, the majority-group participants could meaningfully be clustered into three acculturation strategies commonly used to describe minority-group members’ acculturation, namely a separation, integration and undifferentiated acculturation cluster. No evidence for an assimilation cluster was found. Separated majority members (i.e., who maintain their majority culture but do not adopt immigrant cultures) reported significantly more identity threat and perceived ethnic discrimination, but also higher self-esteem. Interestingly, integrated majority members (i.e., who both maintain their majority culture and adopt immigrant cultures) were three times less likely to live in multi-ethnic neighbourhoods as compared to separated participants. The results of this study offer important insights into majority members’ acculturation experiences and their psychological importance. Implications for culturally plural societies and future research are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Acculturation; Cultural change; Identity threat; Immigration; Majority members","behavior; controlled study; cultural factor; exposure; female; human; human experiment; identity; immigrant; immigration; male; minority group; neighborhood; organization; quantitative study; racism; self esteem",,,,,,,,"Alanya, A., Swyngedouw, M., Vandezande, V., Phalet, K., Close encounters: Minority and majority perceptions of discrimination and intergroup relations in Antwerp, Belgium (2015) International Migration Review; Arends-Tóth, J., van de Vijver, F.J.R., Domains and dimensions in acculturation: Implicit theories of Turkish–Dutch (2004) International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 28 (1), pp. 19-35; Arends-Tóth, J., van de Vijver, F.J.R., Assessment of psychological acculturation (2006) The Cambridge handbook of acculturation psychology, pp. 143-160. , D.L.

This study aimed to identify the predominant culture within the Palestinian Primary Healthcare Centers of the Ministry of Health (PHC-MoH) and the Primary Healthcare Centers of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (PHC-UNRWA) by using the competing values framework (CVF) and examining its influence on the adherence to the Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) for DM. Methods: A cross-sectional design was employed with a census sample of all the Palestinian family doctors and nurses (n=323) who work within 71 PHC clinic. A cross-cultural adaptation framework was followed to develop the Arabic version of the CVF questionnaire. Results: The overall adherence level to the diabetic guideline was disappointingly suboptimal (51.5%, p<0.001; 47.3% in the PHC-MoH and 55.5% in the PHC-UNRWA). In the PHC-MoH, the clan/group culture was the most predominant (mean =41.13; standard deviation [SD] =8.92), followed by hierarchical (mean =33.14; SD=5.96), while in the PHC-UNRWA, hierarchical was the prevailing culture (mean =48.43; SD =12.51), followed by clan/group (mean =29.73; SD =8.37). Although a positively significant association between the adherence to CPG and the rational culture and a negatively significant association with the developmental archetype were detected in the PHC-MoH, no significant associations were found in the PHC-UNRWA. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that the organizational culture has a marginal influence on the adherence to the diabetic guideline. Future research should preferably mix quantitative and qualitative approaches and explore the use of more sensitive instruments to measure such a complex construct and its effects on guideline adherence in small-sized clinics. © 2017 Radwan et al.","Adherence; Clinical practice guideline; Competing values framework; Diabetes mellitus; Organizational culture","adult; Article; clinical practice; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; disease association; female; general practitioner; health center; human; male; middle aged; nurse; organization; organizational policy; population research; practice guideline; protocol compliance; social adaptation; transcultural care",,,,,"Ministry of Health

This study uses Berry’s acculturation framework to explore ethnic boundary-setting within a Colombian immigrant youth dance program in the US. Seven members participated in a multi-year qualitative study that triangulated surveys, interviews, and responses to a hypothetical multicultural dilemma that ‘positioned’ Colombian participants as part of an in-group on the basis of their ethnicity. Specifically, it explores the strategies they employed to deal with the dilemma and the role context played in those strategies. With findings that reveal how youth incorporate the arguments found in mainstream immigration debates to justify integration, segregation, and exclusion of non-Colombians, this study argues that to understand strategies employed, it is necessary to examine local, national, and transnational contexts. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Colombians; Ethnicity; immigrant youth; intergroup relations; out-of-school programs",,,,,,"Spencer Foundation

Aim: The aim of this study was to explore the influence of migration on dietary practices and the process of dietary acculturation amongst Ghanaians living in the UK. Subject and methods: A qualitative study of adults aged ≥25 years (n = 31) of Ghanaian ancestry living in Greater Manchester using face-to-face interviews. Participants varied in socioeconomic status, gender and migration status. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. Results: Three distinct dietary practice typologies were discernible that differed in terms of typical meal formats, meal contexts, structure and patterning of meals, food preparation and purchasing behaviours: (i) continuity practices; (ii) flexible practices; and (iii) changed practices. The identified practices were shaped by interrelating factors that fell into four main clusters: social and cultural environment; accessibility of foods; migration context; and food beliefs/perceptions. Conclusion: Participants retained, to a varying degree, some aspects of Ghanaian dietary practices, whilst adopting key features of UK food culture. This study demonstrates the complexity of dietary change, indicating that it is not a linear process and it is dependent on several factors. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Dietary acculturation; dietary practices and meal patterns; Ghanaians; migration","accessibility; complexity; diet; gender; participatory approach; perception; population migration; quantitative analysis; questionnaire survey; socioeconomic status; typology; England; Ghana; Manchester [England]; United Kingdom; adult; aged; cultural factor; diet; ethnology; female; food preference; Ghana; human; male; middle aged; migration; United Kingdom; Acculturation; Adult; Aged; Diet; Female; Food Preferences; Ghana; Human Migration; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Transients and Migrants; United Kingdom",,,,,,,,"Agyemang, C., Meeks, K., Beune, E., Owusu-Dabo, E., Mockenhaupt, F.P., Addo, J., De Graft Aikins, A., Obesity and type 2 diabetes in sub-Saharan Africans: is the burden in today’s Africa similar to African migrants in Europe?

Given the common use of acculturation measures and the state of the knowledge on alcohol-related health among Latino populations, the current analyses tested the efficacy of acculturation measures to predict various indicators of alcohol consumption. Specifically, this quantitative review assessed the predictive utility of acculturation on alcohol consumption behaviors (frequency, volume, and quantity). Two main analyses were conducted—a p-curve analysis and a meta-analysis of the observed associations between acculturation and drinking behavior. Results demonstrated that current measures of acculturation are a statistically significant predictor of alcohol use (Z = −20.75, p &lt; 0.0001). The meta-analysis included a cumulative sample size of 29,589 Latino participants across 31 studies. A random-effects model yielded a weighted average correlation of 0.16 (95% confidence interval = 0.12, 0.19). Additional subgroup analyses examined the effects of gender and using different scales to measure acculturation. Altogether, results demonstrated that acculturation is a useful predictor of alcohol use. In addition, the meta-analysis revealed that a small positive correlation exists between acculturation and alcohol use in Latinos with a between-study variance of only 1.5% (τ2 = 0.015). Our analyses reveal that the association between current measures of acculturation and alcohol use is relatively small.

Little is known about the effect of cultural orientations on assessment of communication behaviors in cross-cultural educational settings. The purpose of this study is to explore cultural orientation as a potential source of assessor idiosyncrasy or between-assessor variability in assessment of communication skills. More specifically, we explored if and how (expert) assessors’ valuing of communication behaviours aligned with their cultural orientations (power-distance, masculinity-femininity, uncertainty avoidance, and individualism-collectivism). Methods: Twenty-five pharmacist-assessors watched 3 videotaped scenarios (patient-pharmacist interactions) and ranked each on a 5-point global rating scale. Videotaped scenarios demonstrated combinations of well-portrayed and borderline examples of instrumental and affective communication behaviours. We used stimulated recall and verbal protocol analysis to investigate assessors’ interpretations and evaluations of communication behaviours. Uttered assessments of communication behaviours were coded as instrumental (task-oriented) or affective (socioemotional) and either positive or negative. Cultural orientations were measured using the Individual Cultural Values Scale. Correlations between cultural orientations and global scores, and frequencies of positive, negative, and total utterances of instrumental and affective behaviours were determined. Results: Correlations were found to be scenario specific. In videos with poor or good performance, no differences were found across cultural orientations. When borderline performance was demonstrated, high power-distance and masculinity were significantly associated with higher global ratings (r = .445, and .537 respectively, p < 0.05) as well as with fewer negative utterances regarding instrumental (task focused) behaviours (r = −.533 and − .529, respectively). Higher masculinity scores were furthermore associated with positive utterances of affective (socioemotional) behaviours (r = .441). Conclusions: Our findings thus confirm cultural orientation as a source of assessor idiosyncrasy and meaningful variations in interpretation of communication behaviours. Interestingly, expert assessors generally agreed on scenarios of good or poor performances but borderline performance was influenced by cultural orientation. Contrary to current practices of assessor and assessment instrument standardization, findings support the use of multiple assessors for patient-practitioner interactions and development of qualitative assessment tools to capture these varying, yet valid, interpretations of performance. © 2017 The Author(s).","Assessment; Communication; Culture; Medical education; Patient-practitioner communication","avoidance behavior; clinical study; communication skill; cultural value; doctor patient relation; femininity; human; individuality; instrument validation; masculinity; medical education; pharmacist; rating scale; recall; standardization; uncertainty; videorecording; coping behavior; cultural factor; female; health personnel attitude; interpersonal communication; male; migrant; pharmacist; pilot study; professional competence; prospective study; psychology; Qatar; social behavior; Acculturation; Adaptation, Psychological; Attitude of Health Personnel; Communication; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Humans; Male; Pharmacists; Physician-Patient Relations; Pilot Projects; Professional Competence; Prospective Studies; Qatar; Social Behavior; Video Recording",,,,,,,,"Ha, J.G., Longnecker, N., Doctor-patient communication: a review (2010) Ochsner J, 10, pp. 38-43; Simpson, M., Buckman, R., Stewart, M., Maguire, P., Lipkin, M., Novack, D., Till, J., Doctor-patient communication: the Toronto consensus statement (1991) Br Med J, 303, pp. 1385-1387; Simple definition of culture, , http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/culture/, Merriam-Webster.

It has been suggested, consistently with acculturative stress and coping theory and socio-cultural learning theory, that acculturative orientation towards the country of origins, high level of socio-cultural adjustment and lower rates of psychological adjustment could work as risk factors for alcohol consumption increase among this population. The study adopted a mixed method design. An online anonymous questionnaire was submitted in two times (T1 pre-departure and T2, during the sojourn) to a first sample (N = 231; gender = 68.4% female e 31.6% male; average age = 22, SD = 1.54), composed of Italian Credit Mobility Students from a Milan university. 30 of them were also interviewed after their return. Logistic regression's results showed that psychological adjustment was the only variable significantly and positively associated with the amount of alcohol consumed, falsifying the hypothesis. Qualitative results suggested that participants led a lifestyle similar to holiday-makers, featured by limited contact with the local culture, condition that seems to be connected with alcohol consumption rates. In conclusion, the existing theoretical frameworks developed on immigrant population resulted inadequate to explain the drinking phenomenon among Italian CMS.

The acceptance of such care relations from user’s point of view has been rarely explored yet. Aim: It is examined, if and how elderly migrants from Turkey consider a common migration background respectively a common socio-cultural background of caregivers as relevant. Method: In terms of data triangulation results of a qualitative study and a quantitative study on care expectations of elderly migrants from Turkey have been merged. Data was collected by means of guideline-based and standardised interviews. Analysis included the documentary method according to Bohnsack as well as descriptive and multivariate methods. Results: Cultural and migration-related aspects are considered relevant by the vast majority of respondents. Turkish language skills of caregivers are important to more than three-quarters. According to qualitative results, the possibility to objective as well as culturally shaped intuitive communication in the mother tongue is crucial. Correspondingly, a low level of German language skills and a Turkish ethnic identity are associated with a need of migration-sensitive care. Conclusions: A common socio-cultural background with caregivers and the common mother tongue appear to be prerequisites of good care for elderly migrants from Turkey. Further research should examine the conditions under which multicultural care settings are accepted in this group. © 2016 Hogrefe.","Care expectations; Migrants from Turkey; Multicultural care settings","aged; caregiver; expectation; female; German (language); human; human experiment; identity; interview; migrant; practice guideline; qualitative research; quantitative study; skill; tongue; Turkey (republic); cultural diversity; cultural factor; ethnology; evaluation study; geriatric nursing; interpersonal communication; male; middle aged; nurse patient relationship; patient attitude; patient satisfaction; psychological interview; Turkey; very elderly; Acculturation; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Caregivers; Communication; Cultural Diversity; Emigrants and Immigrants; Evaluation Studies as Topic; Female; Geriatric Nursing; Humans; Interview, Psychological; Male; Middle Aged; Nurse-Patient Relations; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Patient Satisfaction; Qualitative Research; Turkey",,,,,,,,"Afentakis, A., Maier, T., Projektionen des Personalbedarfs und -angebots in Pflegeberufen bis 2025.

Design A qualitative, exploratory study using a brief survey and focus groups. Marshallese women, 18 years or older who had a child under 7 years of age, were included in the study. Setting Community-based organization in Northwest Arkansas. Results The majority of mothers viewed breast milk as superior to formula, but had concerns about adequate milk supply and the nutritional value of their milk. The primary barriers to exclusive breast-feeding in the USA included public shaming (both verbal and non-verbal), perceived milk production and quality, and maternal employment. These barriers are not reported in the Marshall Islands and are encountered only after moving to the USA. Breast-feeding mothers rely heavily on familial support, especially the eldest female, who may not reside in the USA. The influence of institutions, including the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, is strong and may negatively affect breast-feeding. Conclusions Despite the belief that breast milk is the healthiest option, breast-feeding among Marshallese mothers is challenged by numerous barriers they encounter as they assimilate to US cultural norms. The barriers and challenges, along with the strong desire to assimilate to US culture, impact Marshallese mothers' perceptions, beliefs and experiences with breast-feeding.

Questionnaires developed to measure acculturation are typically designed for specific ethnic populations and adult experiences. This study developed a questionnaire that measures acculturation among ethnically diverse populations of youth that can be included as a module in population surveys. Methods Questionnaires measuring acculturation in youth were identified in the literature. The importance of items from the existing questionnaires was determined using a Delphi process and this informed the development of our questionnaire. The questionnaire was then pilot tested using a sample of 248 Canadians aged 18-25 via an online system. Participants identified as East and South East Asian (27.8%), South Asian (17.7%) and Black (13.7%). The majority were 1st (33.5%) or 2nd generation immigrants (52.0%). After redundant items were eliminated, exploratory factor analysis grouped items into domains, and, for each domain, internal consistency, and convergent validity with immigrant generation then age at immigration estimated. A subset of participants re-completed the questionnaire for reliability estimation. Results The literature review yielded 117 articles that used 13 questionnaires with a total of 440 questions. The Delphi process reduced these to 32 questions. Pilot testing occurred in 248 Canadians aged 18-25. Following item reduction, 16 questions in three domains remained: dominant culture, heritage language, and heritage culture. All had good internal consistency (Cronbach's alphas &gt; .75). The mean dominant domain score increased with immigrant generation (1st generation: 3.69 (95% CI: 3.49-3.89), 2nd: 4.13 (4.00-4.26), 3rd: 4.40 (4.19- 4.61)), and mean heritage language score was higher among those who immigrated after age 12 than before (p = .0001), indicative of convergent validity. © 2016 Kukaswadia et al.

The necessity for a revised stress-assessment instrument was determined by demographic and political shifts affecting Latin American immigrants and later-generation Hispanics in the United States in the 2 decades since the development of the HSI. The data for the revision of the HSI (termed the HSI2) was collected at 4 sites: Los Angeles, El Paso, Miami, and Boston, and included 941 immigrants and 575 U.S.-born Hispanics and a diverse population of Hispanic subgroups. The immigrant version of the HSI2 includes 10 stress subscales, whereas the U.S.-born version includes 6 stress subscales. Both versions of the HSI2 are shown to possess satisfactory Cronbach's alpha reliabilities and demonstrate expert-based content validity, as well as concurrent validity when correlated with subscales of the Brief Symptom Inventory (Derogatis, 1993) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001). The new HSI2 instruments are recommended for use by clinicians and researchers interested in assessing psychosocial stress among diverse Hispanic populations of various ethnic subgroups, age groups, and geographic location. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","Discrimination; Family stress; Hispanic stress inventory version 2; Immigrant stress; Stress assessment","adult; age distribution; aged; Article; Brief Symptom Inventory; content validity; cultural factor; demography; female; geographic distribution; Hispanic Stress Inventory Version 2; human; immigrant; male; mental stress; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; population research; psychometry; qualitative research; reliability; social status; South and Central America; stress assessment; United States; very elderly; adolescent; devices; ethnology; Hispanic; Massachusetts; middle aged; migrant; psychologic test; psychology; reproducibility; standards; Texas; young adult; Acculturation; Adolescent; Adult; Boston; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Latin America; Male; Middle Aged; Psychological Tests; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Stress, Psychological; Texas; United States; Young Adult",,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH

In linking migration to children’s school trajectories, this mixed-methods study explored a range of cultural and contextual factors that contribute to Chinese children’s school wellbeing in the migratory process. The key variables included acculturative attitudes, economic stress, and relationships with family, teachers and peers. The study drew upon survey data from a sample of 301 Chinese migrant students (4th–9th grade) together with in-depth interviews involving ten selected students focusing on how migrant children’s school happiness and productivity are influenced by acculturation, economic hardship, and social relationships. The quantitative analysis indicated the critical role of integrative states in promoting school satisfaction and achievement. Migrant children with better social relations scored higher levels of hope, which in turn contributed to better school outcomes. Contrary to previous findings, economic stress did not hinder school outcomes for these Chinese migrant children, but appeared to act as a positive motivational factor for pursing academic success. The qualitative analysis echoed the quantitative findings, and provided further explanations for the complexity and particularity of these phenomena. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Academic achievement; Acculturation; China; Migrant students; School satisfaction; Social relationships",,,,,,,,,"Aksel, S., Gün, Z., Irmak, T., Çengelci, B., Migration and psychological status of adolescents in Turkey (2007) Adolescence, 42 (167), pp. 589-602; http://search.proquest.com/docview/304829698?accountid=14548, Ali, A.

Some of the determinants of access to care are knowledge and perceptions of dementia, which may vary between ethnic groups in the population. The aims of this study were to compare knowledge and perceptions of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) among four ethnic groups in Copenhagen, Denmark, and to assess the influence of education and acculturation. Methods Quantitative survey data from 260 participants were analyzed: 100 native Danish, and 47 Polish, 51 Turkish, and 62 Pakistani immigrants. Knowledge and perceptions of dementia and AD were assessed with the Dementia Knowledge Questionnaire (DKQ) supplemented with two questions from the Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Test (ADAT). Knowledge and perceptions of dementia and AD in the four groups were compared, and the influence of education and acculturation was assessed. Results Group differences were found on the DKQ total score as well as all sub-domains. Turkish and Pakistani people were most likely to hold normalizing and stigmatizing views of AD. Level of education and acculturation had limited influence on dementia knowledge, accounting for 22% of the variance at most and had only minor influence on perceptions of AD. Conclusions Lacking knowledge and certain perceptions of dementia and AD may hamper access to services in some ethnic minority groups. Ongoing efforts to raise awareness that dementia and AD are not part of normal aging, particularly among Turkish and Pakistani communities, should be a high priority for educational outreach.

Further guided by the theory of intergroup anxiety, this study also adopted a context-specific approach to distinguish between participants' experience of social anxiety when interacting with European Americans versus with other Chinese in the United States. This quantitative and ex post facto study used a convenience sample of 140 first-generation Chinese immigrants. Participants were recruited through e-mails from different university and community groups across the United States. The sample includes 55 men and 82 women (3 did not specify) with an average age of 36 years old. Results showed that more social anxiety was reported in the European American context than in the Chinese ethnic context. The full models accounted for almost half the variance in anxiety in each context. Although personality accounted for the most variance, the cultural variables and discrimination contributed 14% of the unique variance in the European American context. Notably, low acculturation, high neuroticism, and low extraversion were unique contributors to social anxiety with European Americans, whereas in the Chinese ethnic context only low extraversion was a unique contributor; more discrimination was uniquely significant in both contexts. The findings suggest a need to contextualize the research and clinical assessment of social anxiety, and have implications for culturally sensitive counseling with immigrants. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","Acculturation; Chinese immigrants; Discrimination; Personality; Social anxiety","adult; Article; Chinese; controlled study; cultural factor; ethnic difference; European American; extraversion; female; human; immigrant; major clinical study; male; neurosis; personality; quantitative study; racism; retrospective study; social phobia; United States; anxiety; anxiety disorder; Asian continental ancestry group; ethnology; migrant; personality; psychological model; psychology; questionnaire; racism; Acculturation; Adult; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Emigrants and Immigrants; Extraversion (Psychology); Female; Humans; Male; Models, Psychological; Personality; Racism; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States",,,,,,,,"Benet-Martínez, V., John, O.P., Los Cinco Grandes across cultures and ethnic groups: Multitrait multimethod analyses of the Big Five in Spanish and English (1998) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 75, pp. 729-750. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.75.3.729; Berry, J.W., Acculturation as varieties of adaptation.

Emerging literature suggests the powerful nature of traditions and culture on the lives, mental and physical health of AI immigrants, particularly women. The purpose of this study was to explore depression among AI women in Central California (CC). This mixed-methods research was conducted in collaboration with the CC Punjabi community and the support of local religious leaders. All interviews were conducted in Punjabi and English. Whenever possible we utilized validated scales aligned with emerging themes from the qualitative data, which also provided contextualization to survey responses. In all we conducted 11 key informant interviews, four focus groups (n = 47) and a rigorously developed anonymous survey (n = 350). Social dynamics and traditional expectations including gendered roles significantly affected mental health among women participants. Subgroups along the lines of language choice (Punjabi vs. English) experience and report depression differently in part due to the highly stigmatized nature of mental health issues in this model minority community. The findings of this study highlight the importance of utilizing mixed methods to access hard to reach populations regarding sensitive topics such as mental health. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Acculturation; Asian-indian; Gender; Immigrants; Mental health; Punjabi sikhs","acculturation; cultural influence; health status; immigrant; mental health; psychology; clergy; expectation; female; human; immigrant; Indian; information processing; interview; language; major clinical study; male; mental health; model; United States; adult; Asian continental ancestry group; California; cultural factor; depression; ethnology; health disparity; India; middle aged; migrant; minority group; psychology; questionnaire; California; India; Punjab [India]; United States; Acculturation; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; California; Depression; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Focus Groups; Health Status Disparities; Humans; India; Male; Middle Aged; Minority Groups; Surveys and Questionnaires",,,,,,,,"Gupta, V.B., Impact of culture on healthcare seeking behavior of Asian Indians (2010) J.

Focus groups (n = 10), surveys (demographics, body image silhouettes, and acculturation), and anthropometric measurements were conducted. US-born (n = 36) had higher household incomes, education level, and acculturation scores compared to foreign-born (n = 23). Years in the US was positively correlated with acculturation and anthropometrics. No significant differences were detected between groups for rating infant and adolescent health, indicating mid-sized infants were considered healthy and heavier adolescents had increased health risks. However, qualitative data revealed misconceptions regarding obesity and chronic disease and a cultural preference for heavier infants. Despite differences between groups, qualitative data indicated cultural perceptions of health still persist.

Do women more commonly use contraception following a high-risk pregnancy or caesarean section? What role does current breastfeeding play and, amongst immigrants, what is the effect of acculturation level on the frequency of contraceptive use? Study Population and Methods: Data collection was carried out as part of a larger study in three Berlin delivery units using standardised interviews (questionnaires covering e.g. sociodemographics, immigration history/acculturation and use of antenatal care); telephone interviews comprising 6 questions on postpartum contraception, breastfeeding and postpartum complications were conducted on a sample of the study population six months after delivery. Results: 247 women with, and 358 women without a background of immigration were included in the study (total study population n=605, response rate 81.1%). 68% of 1st generation immigrants, 87% of 2nd/3rd generation women and 73% of women without immigration background (non-immigrants) used contraception. In the logistical regression analysis 1st generation immigrants were less likely than non-immigrants to be using contraception six months postpartum, and 1st generation immigrants with low acculturation level were significantly less likely to use contraception than 2nd/3rd generation women with low acculturation level. Conclusion: In the extended postpartum period there was no major difference in contraceptive use between immigrants in general and non-immigrants. It remains unclear whether the differing contraceptive behaviour of 1st generation immigrants is the result of less access to information, sociocultural factors or differing contraceptive requirements and further targeted, qualitative study is required.","acculturation; immigration; postpartum period; prevention/contraception","adult; Article; breast feeding; cesarean section; contraception; controlled study; cultural factor; demography; female; Germany; high risk pregnancy; human; immigrant; immigration; major clinical study; multicenter study; prenatal care; puerperium; standard; telephone interview",,,,,,,,"Birkhäuser, M., Hadji, P., Imthurn, B., Kontrazeption post partum (2014) Frauenarzt, 55, pp. 1110-1113; Sober, S., Schreiber, C.A., Postpartum contraception (2014) Clin Obstet Gynecol, 57, pp. 763-776; Tepper, N.T., Curtis, K.M., Jamieson, D.J., Update to CDC U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use, 2010: Revised recommendations for the use of contraceptive methods during the postpartum period (2011) MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep, 60, pp. 878-883; Lopez, L.M., Hiller, J.A., Grimes, D.A., Education for contraceptive use by women after childbirth (2012) Cochrane Database Syst Rev, (8). , CD001863; De Bocanegra, H.T., Chang, R., Howell, M., Interpregnancy intervals: Impact of postpartum contraceptive effectiveness and coverage (2014) Am J Obstet Gynecol, 10, pp. 311e1-311e8; Sober, S., Schreiber, C.A., Postpartum contraception (2014) Clin Obstet Gynecol, 57, pp. 763-776; (2013) Zensus 2011.

In particular, we investigated the relationship between acculturation and smoking, taking into consideration the stage of the 'smoking epidemic' in the countries of origin and host countries of the immigrants. Methods: We searched PubMed for peer-reviewed quantitative studies. Studies were included if they focused on smoking among adult immigrants (foreign-born) from non-western countries now residing in the USA, Canada, Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, the UK, and Australia. Studies were excluded if, among others, a distinction between immigrants and their (native-born) offspring was not made. Results: We retrieved 27 studies published between 1998 and 2013. 21 of the 27 studies focused on acculturation (using bidimensional multi-item scales particularly designed for the immigrant group under study and/or proxy measures such as language proficiency or length of stay in host country) and 16 of those found clear differences between men and women: whereas more acculturated women were more likely to smoke than less acculturated women, the contrary was observed among men. Conclusion: Immigrants' countries of origin and host countries have reached different stages of the 'smoking epidemic' where, in addition, smoking among women lags behind that in men. Immigrants might 'move' between the stages as (I) the (non-western) countries of origin tend to be in the early phase, (II) the (western) host countries more in the advanced phase of the epidemic and (III) the arrival in the host countries initiates the acculturation process. This could explain the 'imported' high (men)/low (women) prevalence among less acculturated immigrants. The low (men)/high (women) prevalence among more acculturated immigrants indicates an adaptation towards the social norms of the host countries with ongoing acculturation. © 2015 Reiss et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Acculturation; Immigrants; Smoking; Smoking epidemic; Systematic review","Africa south of the Sahara; Australia; Cambodia; Canada; China; cross-sectional study; cultural anthropology; cultural factor; El Salvador; Ethiopia; Germany; human; immigrant; Iran; Ireland; Korea; Laos; length of stay; Mexico; Morocco; Netherlands; Norway; Pakistan; Philippines; prevalence; priority journal; progeny; quality control; Review; smoking; South Asia; South Korea; Sri Lanka; Suriname; systematic review; Turkey (republic); United Kingdom; United States; USSR; Viet Nam",,,,,,,,"Doll, R., Peto, R., Boreham, J., Sutherland, I., Mortality in relation to smoking: 50 years' observations on male British doctors (2004) BMJ, 328 (7455), pp. 1519-1528. , 437139 15213107; Vineis, P., Alavanja, M., Buffler, P., Fontham, E., Franceschi, S., Gao, Y.T., Tobacco and cancer: Recent epidemiological evidence (2004) J Natl Cancer Inst, 96 (2), pp. 99-106. , 1:STN:280:DC%2BD2c%2FjsV2rsw%3D%3D 14734699; Burns, D.M., Epidemiology of smoking-induced cardiovascular disease (2003) Prog Cardiovasc Dis, 46 (1), pp. 11-29. , 12920698; Shinton, R., Beevers, G., Meta-analysis of relation between cigarette smoking and stroke (1989) BMJ, 298 (6676), pp. 789-794. , 1836102 1:STN:280:DyaL1M3ivFKhsg%3D%3D 2496858; Mackenbach, J.P., Karanikolos, M., McKee, M., The unequal health of Europeans: Successes and failures of policies (2013) Lancet, 381 (9872), pp. 1125-1134. , 23541053; Branstetter, S.A., Blosnich, J., Dino, G., Nolan, J., Horn, K., Gender differences in cigarette smoking, social correlates and cessation among adolescents (2012) Addict Behav, 37 (6), pp. 739-742. , 3334461 22405835; Karasek, D., Ahern, J., Galea, S., Social norms, collective efficacy, and smoking cessation in urban neighborhoods (2012) Am J Public Health, 102 (2), pp. 343-351. , 3483989 22390449; Wilson, L.M., Avila Tang, E., Chander, G., Hutton, H.E., Odelola, O.A., Elf, J.L., Impact of tobacco control interventions on smoking initiation, cessation, and prevalence: A systematic review (2012) J Environ Public Health, 2012, p. 961724. , 3376479 22719777; Hiscock, R., Bauld, L., Amos, A., Fidler, J.A., Munafò, M., Socioeconomic status and smoking: A review (2012) Ann N y Acad Sci, 1248, pp. 107-123. , 22092035; McKee, S.A., Sinha, R., Weinberger, A.H., Sofuoglu, M., Harrison, E.L., Lavery, M., Stress decreases the ability to resist smoking and potentiates smoking intensity and reward (2011) J Psychopharmacol, 25 (4), pp. 490-502. , 3637660 20817750; Christakis, N.A., Fowler, J.H., The collective dynamics of smoking in a large social network (2008) N Engl J Med, 358 (21), pp. 2249-2258. , 2822344 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD1cXmt1Gisrk%3D 18499567; Huisman, M., Kunst, A.E., Mackenbach, J.P., Educational inequalities in smoking among men and women aged 16 years and older in 11 European countries (2005) Tob Control, 14 (2), pp. 106-113. , 1748002 1:STN:280:DC%2BD2M7lvVOktQ%3D%3D 15791020; Kassel, J.D., Stroud, L.R., Paronis, C.A., Smoking, stress, and negative affect: Correlation, causation, and context across stages of smoking (2003) Psychol Bull, 129 (2), pp. 270-304. , 12696841; Barbeau, E.M., Leavy-Sperounis, A., Balbach, E.D., Smoking, social class, and gender: What can public health learn from the tobacco industry about disparities in smoking?

A subjective EV questionnaire, and a language usage questionnaire capturing domain-specific language use was completed by 200 Albanian immigrants of first and second (one and a half) generation residing in various areas all over Greece. In addition, interviews were conducted with 180 informants from the sample to generate useful information for the qualitative analysis. The findings of this study chime with recent findings on Albanian immigrants' social integration strategies. Data analysis uncovers three themes: first, language use is domain-specific, with preferences for the L1 in the home/family domain only, L2 being the language of choice elsewhere especially for the 1.5 generation; second, there are low perceptions of EV of the L1 group across the sample; and third, there is evidence for a shift in language use and competence as a result of an integrative attitude to migration by the respondents, governed mostly by practical reasons. ©2014,Taylor & Francis.","Albanian immigrants; ethnolinguistic vitality; Greece; language use; social integration",,,,,,,,,"Baldwin-Edwards, M., Kyriakou, G., Kakalika, P., Katsios, G., (2004) Statistical Data on Immigrants in Greece: An Analytic Study of Available Data and Recommendations for Conformity with European Union Standards.

Victor Astafiev, Krasnoyarsk, Russian Federation","This research is devoted to the analysis of some aspects of ethnic labor mobility in Krasnoyarsk Krai. The main method of research is a quantitative survey, including the interpretation of the quantitative results. Currently, Krasnoyarsk Krai (Central Siberia, Russia) is a zone of active ethnic labor mobility. The majority of the ethnic migrant workers are from Central Asia (Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan). Ethnic labor mobility from Armenia and Azerbaijan is decreasing. The hosts, the residents of the Krasnoyarsk Krai, are experiencing a range of phobias towards the labor immigrants (xenophobia and migrant-phobia). For the harmonization of relationships between migrants and the hosts, preventative measures should be taken to prevent possible conflicts, including constant monitoring of the situation. The study shows that students and youth of the Siberian Federal University have a positive attitude toward people who are engaged in labor mobility. Political management should take the complex structure of the host into the account and be ready to regulate difficult intercultural relationships between the people of Krasnoyarsk Krai and the people who come there from Central Asia and other countries. © Econjournals.

A new instrument was developed for measuring ethnocentricity, and it showed strong reliability, validating it for potential use in future research. Both quantitative and qualitative results are included. The findings revealed measurable levels of ethnocentricity and bias and were consistent with prior research indicating that respondents who had the lowest levels of education were the most likely to have negative views of Hispanics and to overestimate the size of the Hispanic population. This suggests the least well-educated Americans may hold a certain amount of defensiveness and hostility towards Hispanics. This bias associated with a lack of education could cause Hispanics to be reluctant to fully assimilate into the American culture, creating a cycle of distrust. © 2015, Institute for Education Policy Studies.

It refers to a set of public policies aiming at integrating foreign populations in a given society. This paper aims at investigating the relationships between the integration of four communities settled in France (Algerian, Portugese, Turkish, and Vietnamese) and the presence of associations. The methodology is based on two approaches, quantitative economics and geography. It uses a new database, extracted from the Journal Officiel and several surveys, noticeably TeO. In a first step we ask whether the regional distribution and the density of associations explain the degree of integration of the migrants stemming from the four communities. In a second step we test whether membership in an association increases or decreases the adoption of oppositional identities and if the latter influences the integration via the access to employment. © CNRS-UMR Géographie-cités 8504.","Econometrics; France; Geography; Migration; Social integration","econometrics; employment; immigrant; international migration; social inclusion; France",,,,,,,,"Alfieri, A.-C., Matthiesen, J., Immigrants in Denmark: Improving integration to sustain the welfare state (2005) ECFIN Country Focus, 2 (19), 6p. , http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/publication1355_en.pdf, Economic analysis from the European Commission's Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs; Anderson, B., (2002) L'Imaginaire National, , Paris, La découverte; Baillet, D., Les associations issues de l'immigration, un outil d'intégration?

Numerous studies have described how migration from poor countries and regions to more developed ones leads migrants to adopt a modern diet associated to the risk of acquiring chronic diseases. However, different contexts might influence dietary change in migrants in diverse ways. For this purpose, 28 semi-structured interviews were conducted with adult, female internal migrants to a border city in Mexico. The interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. The results showed trajectories of dietary change to be associated to social position before and after migration. For the participants from rural areas, migration was accompanied by an increase in the consumption of processed foods, and also changes in food insecurity. Migrants who came from urban areas reported a decrease in the perceived quality of food available to them, but their eating pattern was modified only slightly. For some interviewees, migration resulted in the possibility to choose what to eat in a more autonomous way. We discuss how the effect of migration on dietary changes can be manifold, and the necessity to delve into how social context influences these changes. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Culture; Eating; Mexico; Migration; Social conditions","adult; article; diet; eating habit; female; food insecurity; food intake; food quality; human; Mexico; migrant; migration; qualitative research; rural area; semi structured interview; social environment; social status; thematic analysis; urban area; adolescent; aged; catering service; cultural factor; diet; feeding behavior; middle aged; questionnaire; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; young adult; Acculturation; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Diet; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Food Habits; Food Supply; Humans; Mexico; Middle Aged; Qualitative Research; Questionnaires; Social Environment; Socioeconomic Factors; Young Adult",,,,,,,,"Abraido-Lanza, A.F., Armbrister, A.N., Florez, K.R., Aguirre, A.N., Toward a theory-driven model of acculturation in public health research (2006) American Journal of Public Health, 96 (8), pp. 1342-1346; Allen, J.O., Griffith, D.M., Gaines, H.C., ""She looks out for the meals, period.""

Design: Cross-sectional, mixed-methods design using baseline data from longitudinal study of immigrants granted legal permanent residence May to November, 2003, and interviewed June, 2003 to June,2004. Setting: 2003 New Immigrant Survey. Participants: African immigrants from a nationally representative sample (n = 763) averaged 34.7 years of age and 5.5 years' US residency; 56.6% were male, 54.1% were married, 26.1% were Ethiopian, and 22.5% were Nigerian. Main Outcome Measure(s): Current SRH (dependent variable) was measured using 5-point Likert scale questions; dietary acculturation (independent variable) was assessed using a quantitative dietary change scale. Analysis: Multivariate logistic regression tested the relationship of dietary acculturation with currentSRH (α = .05; P < .05 considered significant); exploratory qualitative subset dietary analysis (n= 60) examined food/beverages consumed pre-/post-migration. Results: African immigrants reporting moderate dietary change since arrival in the US had higher odds of poorer SRH status than immigrants reporting low dietary change (odds ratio, 1.903; 95% confidence interval, 1.143-3.170; P = .01). Among most dietary change groups, there was an increase in fast food consumption and decrease in fruit and vegetable consumption. Conclusions and Implications: Nutrition educators and public health practitioners should develop targeted nutrition education for African immigrants who are older, less educated, and at increased health risk. © 2014 Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior.","Acculturation; African continental ancestry group; Emigrants and immigrants; Food habits; Minority health","adult; analysis of variance; Black person; cross-sectional study; cultural factor; feeding behavior; female; health education; human; male; middle aged; migrant; minority health; nutritional assessment; self report; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Acculturation; Adult; African Continental Ancestry Group; Analysis of Variance; Cross-Sectional Studies; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Food Habits; Health Education; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Minority Health; Nutrition Assessment; Self Report; Young Adult",,,,,"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC: 1 U48 DP001929

The goal of this study was to account for the immigration and integration mechanisms at a very local level, as close as possible to the experience of our acting participants, who were immigrants. The project comprised an anthropological section, which led to the content of this article, and a historical part that makes visible the continuities and disruptions of migratory movements. This anthropological research, which essentially has a qualitative nature, comprised two inseparable aspects. On the one hand, we questioned the motivations behind the everincreasing number of migrants settling over the past two or three decades in 14 villages situated in the Bagnes and Entremont valleys, as well as a commune in the Rhône plain, and the way in which they have managed to become “social actors” and put down roots in their respective communities. On the other hand, our study raises the issue of the perpetual recomposing of mountain societies, still often perceived – or promoted – as entities that are rather homogeneous, authentic and specific. In other words, our survey is situated at the intersection between individual and collective identities. © Journal of Alpine Research.","Alpine societies; Collective identities; Integration; Migrant trajectories; Valais","acculturation; collective action; cultural identity; immigrant population; population migration; Switzerland; Valais",,,,,,,,"Amrein, T., Retour sur le parcours Arianna dans le Val d’Anniviers (2013) Revue De géographie Alpine | Journal of Alpine Research, , 101-1 | 2013, consulted 27th February, 2014; Anderson, B., (2006) – Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, , Verso, London; Appadurai, A., Modernity at Large (2000) Cultural Dimensions of Globalization, , 1996; Balandier, G., (2004) Préface, pp. 15-23. , Douglas M., Comment pensent les institutions, La Découverte, Paris; Bourdieu, P., Wacquant, L., (1992) Réponses.

Objective: The aim of this study was to synthesize the qualitative results of research regarding Latina food patterns in order to (a) identify common patterns across Latino culture and within Latino subcultures and (b) inform future research by determining gaps in the literature. Methods: A systematic search of three databases produced 13 studies (15 manuscripts) that met the inclusion criteria for review. The Critical Appraisal Skills Program tool and the recommendations of Squires for evaluating translation methods in qualitative research were applied to appraise study quality. Authors coded through directed content analysis and an adaptation of the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument coding template to extract themes. Coding focused on food patterns, obesity, population breakdown, immigration, acculturation, and barriers and facilitators to healthy eating. Other themes and categories emerged from this process to complement this approach. Results: Major findings included the following: (a) Immigration driven changes in scheduling, food choice, socioeconomic status, and family dynamics shape the complex psychology behind healthy food choices for Latina women; (b) in Latina populations, barriers and facilitators to healthy lifestyle choices around food are complex; and (c) there is a clear need to differentiate Latino populations by country of origin in future qualitative studies on eating behavior. Discussion: Healthcare providers need to recognize the complex influences behind eating behaviors among immigrant Latinas in order to design effective behavior change and goal-setting programs to support healthy lifestyles. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","food patterns; Hispanic Americans; Latinas; obesity; qualitative research","Central America; cultural factor; daily life activity; ethnology; factual database; family relation; feeding behavior; female; health behavior; Hispanic; human; information processing; lifestyle; migration; obesity; qualitative research; review; socioeconomics; South America; statistics; United States; Acculturation; Activities of Daily Living; Caribbean Region; Central America; Databases, Factual; Emigration and Immigration; Family Relations; Female; Focus Groups; Food Habits; Health Behavior; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Life Style; Obesity; Qualitative Research; Socioeconomic Factors; South America; United States",,,,,,,,"Acevedo-Garcia, D., Sanchez-Vaznaugh, E.V., Viruell-Fuentes, E.A., Almeida, J., Integrating social epidemiology into immigrant health research: A cross-national framework (2012) Social Science & Medicine, 75, pp. 2060-2068. , doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.04.040; Arbona, C., Olvera, N., Rodriguez, N., Hagan, J., Linares, A., Wiesner, M., Acculturative stress among documented and undocumented Latino immigrants in the United States (2010) Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences, 32, pp. 362-384. , doi: 10.1177/0739986310373210; Bray, G.A., Medical consequences of obesity (2004) Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, 89, pp. 2583-2589. , doi: 10.1210/jc.2004-0535; Cason, K., Nieto-Montenegro, S., Chavez-Martinez, A., Food choices, food sufficiency practices, and nutrition education needs of Hispanic migrant workers in Pennsylvania (2006) Topics in Clinical Nutrition, 21, pp. 145-158. , http://www.ncfh.org/pdfs/7378.pdf; (2013) 10 Questions to Help You Make Sense of Qualitative Research (Qualitative Research Checklist), , http://www.casp-uk.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/CASP-Qualitative- Research-Checklist-31.05.13.pdf, Critical Appraisal Skills Program; D'Alonzo, K.T., The influence of marianismo beliefs on physical activity of immigrant Latinas (2012) Journal of Transcultural Nursing, 23, pp. 124-133. , doi: 10.1177/1043659611433872; Demes, K.A., Geeraert, N., Measures matter: Scales for adaptation, cultural distance, and acculturation orientation revisited (2014) Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 45, pp. 91-109. , doi: 10.1177/0022022113487590; Denavas-Walt, C., Proctor, B.D., Smith, J.C., (2011) Current Population Reports, P60-239: Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2010, , http://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/p60-239.pdf, Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office; Douglas, M., Deciphering a meal (1997) Food and Culture, A Reader, pp. 36-54. , Counihan C. & Van Esterik, P.

Recent studies, however, indicate the heterogeneity of the group, for example with regard to vocational situation as well as migration trajectories. Accordingly, questions about their integration in the respective host society gain importance. Therefore, this article deals with integration processes of highly-skilled migrants in Germany. Based on a standardised survey (n=553) of foreign academics at the universities in Aachen, Bonn and Cologne, we examine aspects of the cultural and social dimension of integration processes in this group. In order to operationalise cultural integration, we chose linguistic competence indicators and social integration is operationalised using variables related to neighbourhood relationships. The study was primarily conducted using a cluster analysis.With regard to their linguistic skills, the respondents can be divided into fi ve clusters. The members of the fi rst two clusters assess their language profi ciency as above the mean, while the members of the last two clusters assess their language skills as distinctly lower than average. With regard to neighbourhood relationships, we identifi ed six clusters that again differ in the assessment of their neighbourhood contacts. However, no linear-hierarchical composition is apparent in the neighbourhood integration clusters as was for the linguistic clusters. Furthermore, we examined the reciprocal effects between linguistic competence and neighbourhood relationships and the infl uences of selected predictor variables on these two dimensions. There is a highly signifi cant correlation between linguistic competence and the neighbourhood situation. The correlation between linguistic competence and neighbourhood situation and a series of predictor variables such as nationality, academic discipline, family and household structures and duration of stay is also highly signifi cant. We can also assume that some of these correlations, such as the latter, are reciprocal. © Federal Institute for Population Research 2014 - All rights reserved.","Cluster analysis; Highly-skilled migrants; Integration; Linguistic competence; Neighbourhood relationships",,,,,,,,,"Ackers, L., Internationalisation and equality.

Data include open-ended interviews, a ""general information"" questionnaire, and the Language, Identity and Behavioral Acculturation scale.

The healthy migrant hypothesis also suggests that current research approaches consider only ""healthy"" groups. Other methodological concerns include the simple underreporting of deaths, and that commonly used databases may not include all significant attributes and characteristics. We conducted a systematic review, synthesizing and identifying themes not explicitly found in the current literature. We also employ a simple quantitative index to assess the scholarly strength of references. Paradox protection appears uneven and is not generalizable across races, ethnicities, age groups and genders. In addition, acculturation, health behaviors and diet, ethnicity, acculturative stress, adolescence, undocumented and uninsured status, age of arrival in the United States and length of exposure, gender and age appear to be significant in predicting any beneficial effects. © The Author(s) 2013.","benefits; erosion; Hispanic; immigrant; paradox; protection; systematic review",,,,,,"S21MD000103

The former have tended to deploy quantitative and extended methodologies, while the latter studies have opted predominantly for qualitative or intensive methodologies, focusing on particular groups. There are few studies in which the immigrant population is extensively surveyed, covering its diverse origins, life trajectories, and social position in the host society.In this analysis we examine the main factors that shape the perceptions of ethnic and racial discrimination among immigrant groups living in the Oeiras municipality in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area. This analysis is based on a quantitative analysis of a survey of 422 immigrants, of whom approximately half reported having been discriminated against since their arrival in Portugal. The study is focused on three main explanations related to predictive variables: sociographic, acculturation/cultural proximity, and opportunities for contact with the autochthonous population. A multivariate logistic regression demonstrates that there is a statistically significant relationship between perceived discrimination and some sociographic variables including cultural proximity, especially for Brazilians. © 2013 University of Rome 'La Sapienza'.","Brazilians; discrimination; immigrants; perception; Portugal; racism",,,,,,,,,"Adams, G., Tormala, T.T., O'Brien, L.T., The effect of self-affirmation on perception of racism (2006) Journal of experimental social psychology, 42, pp. 616-626; Alexandre, V., (1999) Novos racismos: Perspectivas comparativas, pp. 133-144. , In: Vala J., editors Oeiras,: Celta; Anthias, F., Race and class revisited: conceptualizing race and racisms (1990) The sociological review, 38, pp. 19-42; Baganha, M.I., Marques, J.C., Góis, P., Novas migrações, novos desafios: a imigração do Leste Europeu (2004) Revista Crítica de Ciências Sociais, 69, pp. 95-115; Baganha, M.I., Góis, P., Migrações internacionais de e para Portugal: o que sabemos e para onde vamos?

The streamlined process includes adapting content, translation, pilot testing, and extensive psychometric evaluation but omits in-depth qualitative inquiry to identify the full content domain of the constructs of interest and cognitive interviews to assess how respondents interpret items. Lessons learned suggest that the streamlined process is not sufficient for certain measures, particularly when there is little published information about how the measure performs with different groups, the measure requires substantial item revision to achieve content equivalence, and the measure is both challenging to translate and has little to no redundancy. When these conditions are present, condition-specific procedures need to be added to the streamlined process. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Cross-cultural equivalence; Instrument development; Measurement; Psychometric evaluation","adolescent; adult; child; cultural factor; devices; ethnology; female; human; Islam; middle aged; Middle East; migrant; mother; mother child relation; psychology; psychometry; questionnaire; research; standards; article; equipment; migration; psychological aspect; religion; research; standard; Acculturation; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Humans; Islam; Middle Aged; Middle East; Mother-Child Relations; Mothers; Psychometrics; Research; Surveys and Questionnaires; Acculturation; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Humans; Islam; Middle Aged; Middle East; Mother-Child Relations; Mothers; Psychometrics; Questionnaires; Research",,,,,"National Institute of Nursing Research, NINR: R01NR008504

The study was designed as a comparative cross-sectional one. The sample consisted of 638 persons, of whom 299 were living in Greece and 339 were permanently living in Albania. Dietary habits were recorded by a quantitative questionnaire, including all food categories that have been used for the estimation of the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS). Demographic information, data on education, work and income were recorded. Data collection took place in both Greece and Albania by means of a personal interview. The mean MDS was 32 (±4.2) and 30.3 (±4.5) for Albanian immigrants in Greece and residents of Albania, respectively, (p < 0.001). Bivariate analysis identified that the participants with higher education level, more physical activity, monthly family income ≥€1,500, those with 3-7 meals per day, those with 5-7 breakfasts a week, employed and ex-smokers displayed higher MDS. In the multivariate linear regression analysis, residents of Greece had higher MDS than residents of Albania. Also, those with higher education level, those with more physical activity, those with 3-7 meals per day and those employed had higher MDS. The findings of this study showed that dietary habits of Albanian immigrants in Greece were improved compared to those of the Albanians living in their home country. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Italia.","Albanian immigrants; Dietary acculturation; Greece; Mediterranean Diet Score","adult; Albania; article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; demography; educational status; employment; feeding behavior; female; Greece; human; immigrant; income; male; Mediterranean Diet Score; physical activity; priority journal; questionnaire; scoring system; smoking",,,,,,,,"Baldwin-Eduards, M., Immigrants in Greece: Characteristics and issues of regional distribution (2008) MMO Working Paper N.10.

Clinical participants were immigrants diagnosed by licensed clinicians who worked in the community. Qualitative interviews with clinicians and clinical participants (N = 63) supported the definition of the construct of depression and the development of a 47-item pilot scale. Clinical and community participants (N = 227) completed the pilot scale, measures of neurasthenia and acculturative stress, and the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Module (PHQ-9). A Rasch partial credit model of 42 items-representing psychological, somatic and interpersonal domains of distress-best fit the data. Twenty-two items overlapped with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) symptoms of major depression. Twenty-seven items were biased by acculturation-related variables. Nine items appropriate for self-report screening in primary care and community organizations were chosen to form a brief scale. Both measures showed strong reliability and concurrent and convergent validity. The 9-item scale had better content validity than the PHQ-9. Implications regarding the impact of culture for assessment are highlighted. © 2011 American Psychological Association.","acculturation; assessment; Chinese American; Depression; immigrants",,,,,,,,,"Abe-Kim, J., Takeuchi, D.T., Hong, S., Zane, N., Sue, S., Spencer, M.S., Appel, H., Alegria, M., Use of mental health-related services among immigrant and US-born Asian Americans: Results from the National Latino and Asian American Study (2007) American Journal of Public Health, 97 (1), pp. 91-98. , DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2006.098541; (2000) Voluntary National Test, Cognitive Laboratory Report, Year 2, , American Institutes for Research Palo Alto, CA: Author; Beck, A.T., An inventory for measuring depression (1961) Archives of General Psychiatry, 4, pp. 53-61; Berry, J.W., Kim, U., Minde, T., Mok, D., Comparative studies of acculturative stress (1987) International Migration Review, 21, pp. 491-511. , doi: 10.2307/2546607; Boey, K.W., Cross-validation of a short form of the CES-D in Chinese elderly (1999) International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, 14 (8), pp. 608-617. , DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1166(199908)14:8<608::AID-GPS991>3.0.CO;2-Z; Bond, T.G., Fox, C.M., (2001) Applying the Rasch Model: Fundamental Measurement in the Human Sciences, , Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum; Chan, B., Parker, G., Tully, L., Eisenbruch, M., Cross-cultural validation of the DMI-10 measure of state depression: The development of a Chinese language version (2007) Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 195 (1), pp. 20-25. , DOI 10.1097/01.nmd.0000252008.95227.88, PII 0000505320070100000004; Chan, D.W., The Beck Depression Inventory: What difference does the Chinese version make?

Methods: Arab immigrants who had been in Canada for at least eight years and were currently living in the Greater Toronto Area were recruited. A sample of 24 Arab immigrants completed a mailed, self-administered questionnaire, and six participated in a focus group. The focus group discussion was transcribed verbatim and results were recorded. Latent content analysis was used to analyze, code, and categorize emerging themes. Results: Arab immigrants consumed a mixture of both Arabic and Western food and perceived their current diet to be healthier than it was before they immigrated to Canada. Factors that influenced their food choices included increased nutrition health awareness, differences in food preferences and preparation methods, and preservation of dietary practices in the new environment. Conclusions: Our findings will help dietitians who work with Arab immigrants to become more aware of factors that motivate this group's food choices, and to create nutrition programs that are more culturally sensitive.",,"adult; Arab; article; Canada; cultural factor; diet; ethnology; feeding behavior; female; food preference; human; information processing; male; middle aged; migration; qualitative research; questionnaire; Acculturation; Adult; Arabs; Diet; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Focus Groups; Food Habits; Food Preferences; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Ontario; Qualitative Research; Questionnaires",,,,,,,,"(2007) The Arab Community in Canada, , http://www.statcan.ca/english/freepub/89-621-XIE/89-621-XIE2007009.htm, cited 2011 Aug. 15; Satia-Abouta, J., Patterson, R.E., Neuhouser, M.L., Elder, J., Dietary acculturation: Applications to nutrition research and dietetics (2002) J Am Diet Assoc., 102, pp. 1105-1118; Satia-Abouta, J., Patterson, R.E., Kristal, A.R., Teh, C., Tu, S., Psychosocial predictors of diet and acculturation in Chinese American and Chinese Canadian women (2002) Ethn Health., 7, pp. 21-39; Varghese, S., Moore-Orr, R., Dietary acculturation and health-related issues of Indian immigrant families in Newfoundland (2002) Can J Diet Pract Res., 62, pp. 72-79; Satia-Abouta, J., Dietary acculturation and the nutrition transition: An overview (2010) Appl Physiol Nutr Metab., 35, pp. 219-223; Satia-Abouta, J., Dietary acculturation: Definition, process, assessment, and implications (2003) Int J Hum Ecol., 4, pp. 71-86; Raj, S., Ganganna, P., Bowering, J., Dietary habits of Asian Indians in relation to length of residence in the United States (1999) J Am Diet Assoc., 99, pp. 1106-1108; Desilets, M., Rivard, M., Shatenstein, B., Delisle, H., Dietary transition stages based on eating patterns and diet quality among Haitians of Montreal, Canada (2006) Public Health Nutr., 10, pp. 454-463; Lu, C., Sylvestre, J., Melnychuk, N., Li, J., East Meets West: Chinese-Canadians' perspectives on health and fitness (2008) Can J Public Health., 99, pp. 22-25; Heyman, I., Guruge, S., Makarchuk, M., Cameron, K., Micevski, V., Promotion of healthy eating among new immigrant women in Ontario (2002) Can J Diet Pract Res., 63, pp. 125-129; Kelemen, L.S., Anand, S.S., Vuksan, V., Yi, Q., Teo, K., Devanesen, S., Development and evaluation of cultural food frequency questionnaires for South Asians, Chinese and Europeans in North America (2003) J Am Diet Assoc., 103, pp. 1178-1184; Marquis, M., Shatenstein, B., Food choice motives and the importance of family meals among immigrant mothers (2005) Can J Diet Pract Res., 66, pp. 77-82; Hesse-Biber, S.N., Leavy, P., (2006) The Practice of Qualitative Research, , 1st ed.

The purpose of this review was to present current knowledge and research disparities on acculturation, dietary intake, and health outcomes among the fastest growing minority group in the United States. Fifteen peer-reviewed studies that measured dietary acculturation among Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Dominican older adults living in the United States were identified and examined. This literature review divulged contradictory associations between dietary acculturation and dietary intake, along with nutritional and general health outcomes. Conclusive evidence has yet to be attained due to use of cross-sectional study designs and numerous acculturation measures as well as unique cultural and dietary patterns across diverse Hispanic/Latino populations. Further research is needed to ascertain dietary acculturation among U.S. and foreign-born Hispanic/Latino older adults in the United States and should strive to develop instruments that consider the social, economic, and political environments that influence the dietary acculturation process. Furthermore, longitudinal study designs and qualitative methodologies are warranted. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","acculturation; dietary intake; Hispanics; immigrant; Latinos; nutrition; older adults","caloric intake; cultural factor; decision making; diet; ethnology; feeding behavior; health disparity; Hispanic; human; life expectancy; Mexico; Puerto Rico; review; United States; Acculturation; Choice Behavior; Diet; Energy Intake; Food Habits; Health Status Disparities; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Life Expectancy; Mexican Americans; Mexico; Puerto Rico; United States",,,,,"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC","This research was supported in part with funding by Cooperative Agreement #1U48DP001924 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Prevention Research Centers Program through Core Research Project and Special Interest Project Texas Healthy Aging Research Network.

That silence generates questions about health risks in the contexts of HIV/AIDS and international migration. Based on a qualitative study of mainland Chinese immigrants in Canada, this paper explores the impacts of immigration processes on sex and sexuality. The findings reveal a gap between these individuals' changing sexual behaviours and the continuing silence on sex. Although Canada has exposed them to a new living environment that has shaped the dynamics and patterns of their sexual practices, their incomplete integration into the host society and their close connections with China as the home country mean that traditional Chinese norms continue to influence their understanding of these changes. With the increasing openness of these immigrants' sexual relationships, the obsolescence of their consciousness and knowledge of sexuality should be addressed in order to reduce their vulnerability to sexual inequalities and consequent health risks. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Canada; mainland Chinese immigrants; sex and sexuality; silence","adult; article; attitude to health; Canada; China; cultural factor; ethnology; female; human; human relation; literature; male; middle aged; migration; questionnaire; sexual behavior; sexuality; social change; statistics; Acculturation; Adult; Anecdotes as Topic; Attitude to Health; Canada; China; Cultural Characteristics; Emigration and Immigration; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Middle Aged; Questionnaires; Sexual Behavior; Sexual Partners; Social Change; Young Adult",,,,,,,,"(2010) A recommendation letter to the Ministry of Public Security on the issues of protecting sex workers' human rights in the initiatives of sweeping the erotic and cracking down the illegal, , http://hi.baidu.com/bjazx/blog/item/1a3ee1534291b06f8535240e.html, Beijing Aizhixing Research Insitute, [in Chinese].

There are, however, a growing number of new-generation migrants whose prospects of integration cannot be gleaned from the experience of their predecessors-the old-generation migrants. The reconstruction of migrant network is a lens through which one can examine the extent and pattern of their integration. In this paper, using quantitative data derived from a survey of eight urbanized villages in Guangzhou, we examine the socio-spatial pattern of migrant networks and the role of receiving neighborhoods in social interactions, with a focus on inter-generational differences. The findings show that new-generation migrants are more likely to draw on cross-class, non-kin, and non-territorial networks when seeking social support, but that hometown-based bonds and the urbanite-migrant divisions remain central to their social networks. For the role of receiving neighborhoods, although new-generation migrants have weak neighborly interactions, they construct numerous colleagues and friendship ties that transcend the boundaries of neighborhoods. Moreover, educational attainment, income level, and occupation structure are important determinants of the nature of new-generation migrant networks. The results suggest that generational factors should be highly considered when studying the integration of migrants into Chinese urban society. Accordingly, the integration of migrants into the urban society will be a conflictual and contradictory process. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Guangzhou; New-generation migrants; Social integration; Social network; Urbanized villages","educational attainment; income; neighborhood; occupation; rural-urban migration; social network; urban society; village; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou",,,,,"RES-167-25-0448

This study focused on identifying the main body image and appearance themes among 15 men of Chinese ancestry in Australia using semi-structured interviews and grounded theory. Moderate muscularity was the preferred ideal and height dissatisfaction was shown to be the primary concern. The majority was not invested in achieving muscularity and had a "" holistic"" approach to their body image that included concerns about hairstyling and clothing. In addition, the men were influenced by both Asian and Western ideals, and this included comparison targets with both Asian and Western men. Further studies are needed to assess the extent of men's body image and appearance concerns, and the role played by Asian and Western influences. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Appearance; Australia; Body image; Chinese ancestry; Men; Muscularity","adult; article; Australia; body height; body image; China; control; cultural factor; esthetics; ethnology; gender identity; human; male; migration; psychological aspect; questionnaire; social psychology; somatotype; Acculturation; Adult; Beauty; Body Height; Body Image; China; Emigrants and Immigrants; Gender Identity; Humans; Internal-External Control; Male; Questionnaires; Social Values; Somatotypes; Victoria",,,,,,,,"Altabe, M., Ethnicity and body image: Quantitative and qualitative analysis (1998) International Journal of Eating Disorders, 23, pp. 153-159; Australian Bureau of Statistics (2001), Social trends (Cat.

To explore how and to what extent acculturation and immigration affect Chinese-American immigrant women's breast cancer experience. Background. Acculturation is an important indicator for immigrant health. Less empirical research has been conducted on the association between acculturation and breast cancer experience among Chinese immigrant women in the USA. Design. A mixed methods study. Methods. A total of 107 Chinese-American women with breast cancer completed the structured questionnaire survey, and 16 women completed face-to-face in-depth interviews. Results. In the quantitative findings, acculturation was related to health beliefs, social support and life stress. Cultural interpretations of the qualitative information are offered to show that breast cancer experience was intertwined with cultural adaptation in a given immigrant environment. Chinese cultural beliefs persistently, even after years of immigration, guide Chinese-American immigrant women to respond to breast cancer across the meaning of health and illness, family ties and involvement and social interaction. Conclusion. Our findings show that acculturation is related to health beliefs, social support and life stress in the trajectory of breast cancer adaptation among Chinese-American immigrant women. Life stresses derived from immigration bring additional difficulties for immigrant women living with cancer. Relevance to clinical practice. This study pinpoints that traditional cultural beliefs and immigration stress may influence Chinese-American women to cope with breast cancer. To promote culturally sensitive cancer care for immigrants, healthcare professionals should be aware of and learn intercultural competence. Ethnic social support or outreach healthcare programme may benefit new immigrant families or the immigrant families, who lack social connection, to cope with cancer. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Acculturation; Breast cancer; Cancer adaptation; Chinese-American; Cultural belief; Immigrant","adaptive behavior; article; breast tumor; China; cultural factor; ethnology; female; human; psychological aspect; United States; Acculturation; Adaptation, Psychological; Breast Neoplasms; China; Female; Humans; United States",,,,,,,,"Arman, M., Rehnsfeldt, A., Living with breast cancer - a challenge to expansive and creative forces (2002) European Journal of Cancer Care, 11, pp. 290-296; Ashing, K.T., Padilla, A.M., Kagawa-Singer, M., Understanding the breast cancer experience of Asian American women (2003) Psycho-Oncology, 12, pp. 38-58; Ashing-Giwa, K.T., Padilla, G., Tejero, J., Kraemer, J., Wright, K., Coscarelli, A., Clayton, S., Hills, D., Understanding the breast cancer experience of women: a qualitative study of African American, Asian American, Latina and Caucasian cancer survivors (2004) Psycho-Oncology, 13, pp. 408-428; Ashing-Giwa, K.T., Tejero, J.S., Kim, J., Padilla, G.V., Hellemann, G., Examining predictive models of HRQOL in a population-based, multiethnic sample of women with breast carcinoma (2007) Quality of Life Research, 16, pp. 413-428; Auerbach, C.F., Silverstein, L.B., (2003) Qualitative data: An Introduction to Coding and Analysis, , New York University Press, New York; Baider, L., Kaufman, B., Ever-Hadani, P., De-Nour, A.K., Coping with additional stresses: comparative study of healthy and cancer patient new immigrants (1996) Social Science and Medicine, 42, pp. 1077-1084; Chan, C.W.H., Molassiotis, A., Yam, B.M.C., Chan, S.L., Lam, C.S.W., Traveling through the cancer trajectory: social support perceived by women with gynecologic cancer in Hong Kong (2001) Cancer Nursing, 24, pp. 387-394; Creswell, J.W., (2008) Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative and Mixed Methods Approaches, , 3rd edn.

This paper explores the dangers associated with intensely bonded and disconnected communities and the relationship between refugee marginalization and the presence of youth gangs. Drawing upon a small-scale qualitative study with young refugees in Glasgow, it seeks to explore the extent to and ways in which these young people experience social bonding and bridging and participate in gang culture. The findings suggest that excessive bonding social capital often limits opportunities for inter-cultural integration in Glasgow. Gang membership, although driven primarily by territorial issues, provides one site for ethnic solidarity and racial prejudice. The paper considers the potential for community initiatives to build inter-cultural cohesion, and ends by calling for changes to dispersal policy and for further research to explore the most effective vehicles for building social capital in multi-ethnic urban communities. © The Author 2011.

It emerges that the difference between men and women alone cannot explain inequalities in success and integration. A generational approach centred on the women interviewed enabled us to shed light on individual trajectories within a wider historical context, sometimes refuting certain preconceived ideas on such or such a period in history, which though bloody or violent overall, paradoxically had emancipating and integrating effects in terms of employment for certain migrant women. © 2011 - China Perspectives.","Gender; Generations; History; Integration; Migration; Shanghai; Women; Work",,,,,,,,,"Yingfang, C., (2006) Penghuqu: jiyizhong de shenghuo shi, , (Shantytowns: Life stories as told by their inhabitants), Shanghai, Guji; Sayad, A., (1999) La double absence, , Des illusions de l'émigré aux souffrances de l'immigré, Paris, Seuil; Maruani, M., Reynaud, E., (1993) Sociologie de l'emploi, p. 3. , Paris, La Découverte, col.

Yet little is known about the role of beliefs and preferences in immigrants' dietary practices and their relationship to the retail food environment in which the practices occur. We conducted a mixed-methods convergence study of these issues. Twenty-eight foreign-born Hispanic adult women, recruited from families enrolled in a childhood asthma study and mainly living in New York City took part in 60-90 min, semi-structured interviews regarding their dietary beliefs, preferences, and practices. The findings were then used to formulate hypotheses for analyses of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) data collected from the 345 New York Hispanic women enrolled in the asthma study. Generalized estimating equations were used to determine whether characteristics of the retail food environment within 0.5 km of the home predicted diet, adjusting for individual and neighborhood socio-demographic characteristics. In the interviews, healthy food was rarely discussed in terms of nutritional content. Instead, considerations of freshness, as indicated by time since harvest or slaughter and thus local sourcing; purity, as indicated by the absence of preservatives and processing; and naturalness, as indicated by chemical free farming practices, were the primary axes around which healthy food was defined. Quantitative results were consistent with the qualitative findings: 1) the presence of a farmers' market within the home neighborhood was associated with consumption of more total servings per day of fruit, vegetables, and juice, and 2) the presence of a farmers' market and/or a livestock market was associated with consumption of more servings per day of meat. Proximity to supermarkets or medium-sized grocery stores was not associated with consumption. The results suggest that the availability of fresh produce and meat from local farms may influence diet among Hispanic women in urban neighborhoods. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Diet; Dietary acculturation; Hispanics; Immigrants; Mixed-method research; Neighborhood food environment; USA; Women","diet; European immigrant; food consumption; neighborhood; obesity; retailing; womens status; adult; article; eating habit; female; food frequency questionnaire; food preference; fruit; fruit juice; health food; Hispanic; human; immigrant; market; methodology; mixed method study; nutritional health; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; semi structured interview; United States; urban population; vegetable; Adult; Attitude to Health; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Food Habits; Food Services; Humans; Interviews as Topic; New York City; Residence Characteristics; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States",,,,,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI: R01HL068236

The small area analysis presented here evolved in consultation with a local Planning Committee including older adults and service providers that guided development of an aging services plan for Dare County on the North Carolina Outer Banks. Multiple methods were applied, including secondary historical and contextual data, in-depth interviews, and a brief survey of older adults using services. Findings suggest difference among communities in the integration of later life migrants with older natives that provides context for service needs and delivery. Community difference stems from topographical land form characteristics, socioeconomic and cultural difference between later life migrants and older natives, and the course of residential development across communities. © The Author(s) 2011.","community integration; later life migration; topography","aged; aging; article; community care; consultation; cultural anthropology; elderly care; health care delivery; health care planning; health service; health survey; human; integration; interview; migration; pensioner; retirement; social welfare; social work; socioeconomics; topography; United States",,,,,,,,"Bennett, D.G., The impact of retirement migration on Carteret and Brunswick counties, N.C.

This may be partially a result of dietary practices in the United States. There is limited information about which factors are related to dietary practices in refugee populations, particularly those who have been in the United States for 10 to 20 years. Research with Cambodian communities may be useful for examining the relationship between refugee characteristics and dietary practices. Two focus groups (n=11) and a survey (n=150) of Cambodian refugee women were conducted in Lowell, MA, from 2007 to 2008. χ(2) analyses, t tests, and analysis of variance tests were used to describe differences in dietary practices (24-hour recall and a targeted qualitative food assessment) by group characteristics. Higher acculturation was related to higher likelihood of eating brown rice/whole grains, and to lower likelihood of eating high-sodium Asian sauces. Higher education was related to higher likelihood of eating vegetables and fruits and to eating white rice fewer times. Nutrition education and receiving dietary advice from a health care provider were related to higher likelihood of eating whole grains/brown rice. Having a child at home was related to a higher likelihood of eating fast food. Among Cambodian refugees who have been in the United States for 10 to 20 years, dietary practices appear to have a relationship with acculturation (positive association), the interrupted education common to refugees (negative association), nutrition education from either programs or health care providers (positive association), and having a child at home (negative association).

Given the particular demands of agricultural labor, however, farmworkers and their partners are highly susceptible to a host of occupation-specific stressors that may result in relationship conflict, and thereafter IPV. In cases where one or both members of the dyad engage in problematic drinking, the likelihood of violence increases exponentially. The purpose of this exploratory quantitative study was to estimate the prevalence of IPV among a mixed gender sample of farmworkers in San Diego County, California, and assess the association of potential correlates (acculturation- and work-related stress, problem drinking, and impulsivity) to IPV. Bilingual interviewers conducted survey data collection by using standardized instruments (e.g., Revised Conflict Tactics Scale; Migrant Farm Work Stress Inventory; AUDIT). Nearly all participants (n = 100) were Mexican born. Results showed that approximately 16% of female individuals (n = 61) and 32% of male individuals (n = 37) reported partner violence perpetration, victimization, or both, in the past year. Significant correlates of IPV were problem drinking (among males) and impulsivity (among females). This study demonstrates the feasibility of conducting IPV research among male and female farmworkers. Additional research is warranted to more fully explore the role of acculturation- and work-related stress, drinking, and other personal characteristics and environmental factors in precipitating couple conflict and thereafter IPV. © 2011 American Psychological Association.","Alcohol problems; Farmworkers; Intimate partner violence; Latino; Stress","adult; agricultural worker; alcohol abuse; article; conflict; controlled study; cultural factor; drinking behavior; female; Hispanic; human; impulsiveness; interview; intimate partner violence; job stress; male; migration; partner violence; prevalence; sex difference; United States; Acculturation; Adult; Agriculture; Alcohol Drinking; Alcoholism; California; Crime Victims; Data Collection; Female; Humans; Impulsive Behavior; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Mexican Americans; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Sexual Partners; Spouse Abuse; Stress, Psychological; Young Adult",,,,,,,,"Archer, J., Sex differences in aggression between heterosexual partners: A meta-analytic review (2000) Psychological Bulletin, 126, pp. 651-680; Babor, T.F., Higgins-Biddle, J.C., Saunders, J.B., Monteiro, M.G., (2001) AUDIT: The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test: Guidelines for Use in Primary Care, , http://www.unicri.it/min.san.bollettino/dati/auditbro.pdf, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland; Bachman, R., Saltzman, L., (1995) Violence against women: Estimates from the Redesigned Survey, , U.S. Dept. of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Washington, DC; Benson, P., El campo: Facility and structural violence in farm labor camps (2008) Cultural Anthropology, 23 (4), pp. 589-629; Berns, N., Degendering the problem and gendering the blame: Political Discourse on Women and Violence (2001) Gender & Society, 15 (2), pp. 262-281; Bonomi, A.E., Medical and psychosocial diagnoses in women with a history of intimate partner violence (2009) Archives of Internal Medicine, 169 (18), pp. 1692-1697; Caetano, R., Cunradi, C.B., Schafer, J., Clark, C.L., Intimate partner violence and drinking among White, Black and Hispanic couples in the U.S (2000) Journal of Substance Abuse, 11, pp. 123-138; Caetano, R., Ramisetty-Mikler, S., Wallisch, L.S., McGrath, C., Spence, R.T., Acculturation, drinking, and alcohol abuse and dependence among Hispanics in the Texas-Mexico border (2008) Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research, 32, pp. 314-321; Cherpitel, C.J., Borges, G., Performance of screening instruments for alcohol problems in the ER: A comparison of Mexican-Americans and Mexicans in Mexico (2000) American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse, 26, pp. 683-702; Coker, A.L., Smith, P.J., McKeown, R.E., King, M.J., Frequency and correlates of intimate partner violence by type: Physical, sexual, and psychological battering (2000) American Journal of Public Health, 90, pp. 553-559; Connelly, C.D., Newton, R.R., Aarons, G.A., A psychometric examination of English and Spanish versions of the Revised Conflict Tactics Scales (2005) Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 20 (12), pp. 1560-1579; (2008) Crop statistics and annual report, , County of San Diego, County of San Diego, Department of Agriculture, Weights, and Measures, San Diego, CA; Cunradi, C., Drinking level, neighborhood social disorder, and mutual intimate partner violence (2007) Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research, 31, pp. 1-8; Cunradi, C.B., Caetano, R., Clark, C.L., Schafer, J., Alcohol-related problems and intimate partner violence among white, black, and Hispanic couples in the U.S (1999) Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research, 23 (9), pp. 1492-1501; Cunradi, C.B., Caetano, R., Clark, C., Schafer, J., Neighborhood poverty as a predictor of intimate partner violence among white, black, and Hispanic couples in the United States: A multilevel analysis (2000) Annals of Epidemiology, 10 (5), pp. 297-308; Cunradi, C.B., Caetano, R., Schafer, J., Alcohol-related problems, drug use, and male intimate partner violence severity among US couples (2002) Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research, 26, pp. 493-500; Cunradi, C.B., Todd, M., Duke, M., Ames, G., Problem drinking, unemployment, and intimate partner violence among a sample of construction industry workers and their partners (2009) Journal of Family Violence, 24, pp. 63-74; Duke, M.R., (2011), Ethnicity, well-being, and the organization of labor among shade tobacco workers.

Unlike their predecessors who flooded into cities as Diaspora, neo-migrants become deeply grafted into cities. Being a major concern of Chinese society, such neo-migrants and their social relations have never been systematically explored. Based on a survey of eight migrant villages in Guangzhou, the largest capital of southern China, this study sheds light upon the social network and related issues for neo-migrants. In particular, it tries to examine the impacts of the enclave or accumulation space upon the social networks of migrants. Through a series of quantitative studies, it is found that the social networks of neo-migrants is becoming diversified, modernized and varied across the urban space. In contrast to the old generation migrants, more connections can be found between the neo-migrants and various social strata, especially those beyond the enclaves. As such, it is argued that the social network of neo-migrants is moving beyond the boundary of migrant enclaves or villages, so that a new trend of social integration between migrants and the local society can be found. Moreover, it is argued that new migrant enclave today is by no means as insulated or segregated as in history, as migrant enclaves is gradually reconstructed when neo-migrants establish new types of social ties beyond the spatial boundaries. Nevertheless, sociospatial segregation between migrants and local residents still can be found, and the significance of traditional social networks for migrants, i.e., kinship or laoxiang relations, is still evident, though the extent of which has been largely alleviated. In addition, migration history, social economic status and social cultural characteristics also have significant impacts upon the restructuring of migrant social networks. As such, it is concluded that that the trend of moving beyond the spatial segregation in terms of neo-migrants' social networks will be a progressive, piecemeal and time-lasting process.","Guangzhou; Neo-migrant; Social network; Social space","diaspora; migrant worker; social network; socioeconomic status; spatial analysis; urban site; urban society; urbanization; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou",,,,,,,,"Gu, C., Chan, R., Liu, J., Beijing's socio-spatial restructuring: Immigration and social transformation in the epoch of national economic reformation (2006) Progress in Planning, 66 (4), pp. 249-310; Lian, S., (2009) Ant Tribe-Report of University Graduate Enclaves, , Nanning: Guangxi Normal University Press; (2006) Report of Chinese Migrant Workers, , Research Office of the State Council, Beijing: Yanshi Press; Wang, C., A study of floating rural people's 'semi-urbanization (2006) Sociological Studies, (5), pp. 107-123; Wang, C., Social integration of new generation migrant workers in cities (2010) Population Research, 34 (2), pp. 31-34; Knox, P., Pinch, S., (2000) Urban Social Geography: An Introduction, , 4th ed.

Under extraordinary conditions throughout the twentieth century (Imperial Japanese rule, the brutal Battle of Okinawa at the end of World War II, U.S. military occupation), Okinawans left their homeland and created various diasporic communities around the world. Colonia Okinawa, a farming settlement in the tropical plains of eastern Bolivia, is one such community that was established in the 1950s under the guidance of the U.S. military administration. Although they have flourished as farm owners in Bolivia, thanks to generous support from the Japanese government since Okinawa?s reversion to Japan in 1972, hundreds of Bolivian-born ethnic Okinawans have left the Colonia in the last two decades and moved to Japanese cities, such as Yokohama, to become manual laborers in construction and manufacturing industries. Based on the author?s multisited field research on the work, education, and community lives of Okinawans in the Colonia and Yokohama, this ethnography challenges the unidirectional model of assimilation and acculturation commonly found in immigration studies. In its vivid depiction of the transnational experiences of Okinawan-Bolivians, it argues that transnational Okinawan-Bolivians underwent the various racialization processes?in which they were portrayed by non-Okinawan Bolivians living in the Colonia and native-born Japanese mainlanders in Yokohama and self-represented by Okinawan-Bolivians themselves?as the physical embodiment of a generalized and naturalized ""culture"" of Japan, Okinawa, or Bolivia. Racializing narratives and performances ideologically serve as both a cause and result of Okinawan-Bolivians? social and economic status as successful large-scale farm owners in rural Bolivia and struggling manual laborers in urban Japan. As the most comprehensive work available on Okinawan immigrants in Latin America and ethnic Okinawan ""return"" migrants in Japan, Embodying Belonging is at once a critical examination of the contradictory class and cultural identity (trans)formations of transmigrants; a rich qualitative study of colonial and postcolonial subjects in diaspora, and a bold attempt to theorize racialization as a social process of belonging within local and global schemes. © 2010 by University of Hawai'i Press.

This study's purpose was to identify determinants of breast-feeding for Latina mothers in Cincinnati through qualitative interviews and Spanish Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale ratings. Our findings suggest that, along with similar levels of breast-feeding self-confidence, foreign-born Latina women in the Greater Cincinnati area share similar breast-feeding determinants with the general population. However, characteristics of these determinants and their impact vary because of unique pressures experienced by this community.

We ascertained the degree to which language (English versus Spanish), and residence time in the US influence responses to survey questions concerning two topics: self-reported acculturation status, and recent physical activity (PA). This topic is likely to be of general interest because of growing numbers of immigrants in countries worldwide. Methods. We carried out qualitative (cognitive) interviews of survey items on acculturation and physical activity on 27 Latino subjects from three groups: (a) In Spanish, of those of low residence time (less than five years living in the U.S.) (n = 9); (b) In Spanish, of those of high residence time (15 or more years in the U.S) (n = 9); and (c) in English, of those of high residence time (n = 9). Results. There were very few language translation problems; general question design defects and socio-cultural challenges to survey responses were more common. Problems were found for both acculturation and PA questions, with distinct problem types for the two question areas. Residence time/language group was weakly associated with overall frequency of problems observed: low residence time/Spanish (86%), high residence time/Spanish (67%), and English speaking groups (62%). Conclusions. Standardized survey questions related to acculturation and physical activity present somewhat different cognitive challenges. For PA related questions, problems with such questions were similar regardless of subject residence time or language preference.

Qualitative data have been used which were obtained from in-depth and biographical interviews. These data have been supplemented with quantitative data from Spanish public opinion surveys. The research results show a positive attitude toward Brazilian people among the Spanish population, which would facilitate their social integration in the host context. Also, there are ambivalent discourses in the social representation of the Brazilian group. Specifically, there is a gender inequity in the social image of the Brazilian group involving situations and discriminatory attitudes towards Brazilian women.","Brazilian immigrants; Native population; Social images; Spanish context; Stereotypes",,,,,,,,,"Abric, J.C., (1994) Pratiques Sociales et Représentations, , París: PUF; Assis, G.O.D., Criciúma para o mundo - Os novos fluxos da população brasileira: gênero e rearranjos familiares (2003) Fronteiras Cruzadas: Etnicidade, Gênero e Redes Sociais, , en Martes, Ana Cristina y Soraya Fleischer [orgs.], São Paulo: Vozes; María, A.B., (1986) Concepto de Representaciones Sociales: Un Análisis Comparativo, pp. 8-9. , en Revista Costarricense de Psicología, San José, Costa Rica: El Colegio; Blanco, C., (2000) Las Migraciones Contemporánea, , Madrid: Alianza; Calvo, B.T., (2000) Inmigración y Racismo.

The first study used survey methods with 220 participants in seven sites and the second, in-depth qualitative interviews with 30 community members in three sites.RESULTS: In the first study, economic hardship and family adaptation challenges were reported to affect Sudanese mental well-being. The second study explored cultural aspects of Sudanese family and community well-being in greater depth. Meanings of home emerged from data as a key concept linking social support, resettlement, and mental health. Findings highlight how the presence or absence of the social supports associated with home affect refugees' mental health during resettlement. The analysis focuses on four themes: emotional support; fulfilling social roles and expectations; problem solving and conflict resolution; and dignity and growth, as well as perceived impact on community mental health.CONCLUSION: Qualities of home that Sudanese lack during resettlement points to critical gaps that must be filled by mental health and other service providers to promote positive refugee mental health in countries of resettlement.",,"adaptive behavior; adult; Canada; cultural factor; ethnology; family relation; female; health survey; human; interview; male; mental health; mental stress; middle aged; psychology; qualitative research; refugee; social behavior; social support; Sudan; Acculturation; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Alberta; Family Relations; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Ontario; Qualitative Research; Refugees; Social Responsibility; Social Support; Stress, Psychological; Sudan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14653419,,,"20306355","English","Ethn Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956172653

Literature study. A search was performed in Medline, Embase and PsycInfo for empirical studies about pregnancy and delivery specifically among asylum seekers in Western host countries and published since 1995. Picarta and the authors' literature collections were used to find Dutch studies. Google was used to find grey literature. Published empirical studies on pregnancy outcome indicators specific for asylum seekers were scarce and limited to the Netherlands. The studies found revealed an increased risk of perinatal and maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity. These studies, however, were based on small numbers of cases. Qualitative studies revealed that pregnant asylum seekers expressed the following needs: a) information about pregnancy and about healthcare in the host country, b) healthcare professionals who pay attention to their problems and c) mothers' groups for social contacts and information exchange. Specific attention must be paid to improving the care for pregnant asylum seekers, since the limited number of studies suggest that asylum seekers are at increased risk of perinatal mortality, maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity. More studies are needed into risk factors and quality of care for pregnant asylum seekers. The publications studied contain recommendations for an improved matching of the care with the needs expressed. The recommendations concern provision of information, cultural competencies of care providers, identification of risk factors, health networks approach, continuity of care and organising mother's groups.",,"article; cultural factor; ethnic group; female; health care quality; human; information dissemination; needs assessment; Netherlands; patient care; patient education; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; psychological aspect; refugee; risk factor; social adaptation; statistics; Acculturation; Continuity of Patient Care; Ethnic Groups; Female; Humans; Information Dissemination; Needs Assessment; Netherlands; Patient Education as Topic; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Quality of Health Care; Refugees; Risk Factors; Social Adjustment",,,,,,,,,"Goosen, S.email: sgoosen@ggd.nl",,,,,,,,18768784,,,"21118601","Dutch","Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959560704

Few published studies describe the experiences of women of Mexican descent with a history of intimate partner abuse, specifically in terms of their process of disclosure of abuse. Methods: A qualitative research design was used to conduct this study in south Texas adjacent to the United States-Mexico border. Twenty-six key informants were recruited from two different sites. An open-ended approach with a semistructured interview guide was used to collect the narrative information from the 26 participants. Results: The findings illuminated that many factors hindered disclosure. Some of these factors included protecting their partners, avoidance of worrying their mothers, and fear of losing their children. Conclusions: The study may help healthcare providers to understand the complexity of disclosure by women with a history of intimate partner abuse and may help explain why women do not readily disclose their abusive situations. Clinical Relevance: This study on the disclosure decision process of abuse by women of Mexican descent provides some understanding on the cultural or situational factors that hindered or encouraged disclosure; ultimately this knowledge can help healthcare providers and others to provide for the woman's health, welfare, and safety. © 2009 Sigma Theta Tau International.","Abuse; Disclosure; Family violence; Intimate partner violence; Mexican American; Mexican immigrant","adult; article; attitude to health; battered woman; communication disorder; cultural factor; denial; education; ethnology; fear; female; Hispanic; human; middle aged; migration; motivation; nursing methodology research; partner violence; psychological aspect; qualitative research; questionnaire; recumbency; self disclosure; shame; statistics; United States; verbal communication; Acculturation; Adult; Attitude to Health; Battered Women; Communication Barriers; Deception; Denial (Psychology); Emigrants and Immigrants; Fear; Female; Humans; Mexican Americans; Middle Aged; Motivation; Narration; Nursing Methodology Research; Qualitative Research; Questionnaires; Self Disclosure; Shame; Spouse Abuse; Texas",,,,,,,,"The role of the pediatrician in recognizing and intervening on behalf of abused women (1998) Pediatrics, 101, pp. 1091-1092. , American Academy of Pediatrics; Psychosocial risk factors: Perinatal screening and intervention (2006) Obstetrics and Gynecology, 108, pp. 469-477. , American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; American Medical Association diagnostic and treatment guidelines on domestic violence (1992) Archives of Family Medicine, 1, pp. 39-47. , American Medical Association; Bassuk, E., Dawson, R., Huntington, N., Intimate partner violence in extremely poor women: Longitudinal patterns and risk markers (2006) Journal of Family Violence, 21, pp. 387-399; Belknap, R.A., Sayeed, P., Te contaría mi vida: I would tell you my life, if only you would ask (2003) Health Care for Women International, 24, pp. 723-737; Boeije, H., A purposeful approach to the constant comparative method in the analysis of qualitative interviews (2002) Quality & Quantity, 36, pp. 391-409; (2000) Revised Final FY 1999 Performance Plan and FY 2000 Performance Plan X.

The seminar was designed to have teachers experience first-hand the phases and challenges of second language learning, and enhance understanding of their immigrant students' culture with a view to transform such an experience into culturally responsive pedagogy. The 17 seminar participants all lived with host families while engaging in intensive Spanish language study at a university in the DR and simultaneously taking a graduate course on second language acquisition. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of data sources, including language questionnaires, an intercultural development inventory, culture portfolios, and post-seminar evaluations and interviews showed that participants developed empathy for immigrant students' linguistic struggles, developed a better understanding of the language-learning process, and came to appreciate the complexity of culture and cultural adaptation. The study also underscored the need for teacher education curriculum to be more culturally responsive to the rapidly increasing linguistic and cultural diversity in the student population today. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Culturally responsive pedagogy; Dominican republic; Immigrant learners; Spanish language immersion; Study abroad; Teacher training",,,,,,,"I’d like to thank the Fulbright-Hays Foundation for funding this project.

Immigrants and their descendants represent an important percentage of today's urban populations. Different policies ranging from labour markets to education, housing or health policies address the specific needs of this part of society. However, public policy and planning concepts related to urban forests rarely focus on immigrants. Very few studies investigate the recreation patterns of immigrants despite the potential influence of their different cultural backgrounds on their perceptions or preferences regarding urban woodlands. In addition, urban woodlands could potentially play a role in the social integration of migrants into the society due to being an element of nature with a strong symbolic identification potential and also a public space for social interactions. This paper discusses the results of a qualitative enquiry carried out in Freiburg, Germany, involving migrants from Turkey, the Balkan countries and Russia-Germans. The results point towards many differences in their recreational use patterns and their perception of urban forests, especially between the Turkish interviewees and the other two groups. Furthermore, the results suggest that the emotional attachment to forests can play diverse roles in the identification process of immigrants to their host country. Finally, social interactions were depicted in the interviews as being an important aspect of a forest visit. Nevertheless, social contact between forest visitors seemed to remain mostly on a 'small-talk' level. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

The present study examined the sociocultural adjustment of sojourning Malaysian students in Britain. Eighty-one Malay and 110 Chinese students enrolled in various courses answered a self-report questionnaire that examined various aspects of sociocultural adjustment. A series of one-way analyses of variance showed that Malay participants experienced poorer sociocultural adjustment in comparison with their Chinese counterparts. They were also less likely than Chinese students to have contact with co-nationals and host nationals, more likely to perceive their actual experience in Britain as worse than they had expected, and more likely to perceive greater cultural distance and greater discrimination. The results of regression analyses showed that, for Malay participants, perceived discrimination accounted for the greatest proportion of variance in sociocultural adjustment (73%), followed by English language proficiency (10%) and contact with host nationals (4%). For Chinese participants, English language proficiency was the strongest predictor of sociocultural adjustment (54%), followed by expectations of life in Britain (18%) and contact with host nationals (3%). By contrast, participants' sex, age, and length of residence failed to emerge as significant predictors for either ethnic group. Possible explanations for this pattern of findings are discussed, including the effects of Islamophobia on Malay-Muslims in Britain, possible socioeconomic differences between Malay and Chinese students, and personality differences between the two ethnic groups. The results are further discussed in relation to practical steps that can be taken to improve the sociocultural adjustment of sojourning students in Britain. © 2008 International Union of Psychological Science.",,"adaptive behavior; adult; article; Asian; comparative study; cultural factor; ethnology; female; human; Malaysia; male; migration; psychological aspect; questionnaire; religion; social behavior; student; United Kingdom; Acculturation; Adaptation, Psychological; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Buddhism; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Great Britain; Humans; Islam; Malaysia; Male; Questionnaires; Religion and Psychology; Social Identification; Students; Young Adult",,,,,,,,"Ataca, B., Berry, J.W., Psychological, socio-cultural and marital adjustment of Turkish immigrant couples in Canada (2002) International Journal of Psychology, 37, pp. 13-26; (2004) Islamophobia: Issues, Challenges and Action, , Commission on British Muslims and Islamophobia, London: Trentham Books; Dodge, S., Culture shock and alienation remain problems for many foreign students on US campuses (1990) The Chronicle of Higher Education, pp. A33-36. , (March 7); Furnham, A., Bochner, S., Social difficulties in a foreign culture: An empirical analysis of culture shock (1982) Cultures in Contact: Studies in Cross-Cultural Interaction, pp. 161-198. , In S.

Whereas Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are common conditions in this population of frail older adults, little is known about the beliefs of foreign home care workers about ADRD or about their practices. Methods: A mixed-methods design was conducted in 2006-2007 in Israel. The study included a survey of beliefs about ADRD completed by 184 Filipino home care workers and qualitative interviews with 29 Filipino home care workers. Results: On seven of the 14 belief items, more than 30% of the workers were in discordance with scientific view about ADRD. Those workers who were not informed about the care recipient's medical conditions were more likely to report beliefs that were inconsistent with current scientific knowledge. In qualitative interviews, Filipino home care workers reported using intuitively behavioral techniques when caring for older adults with ADRD. Conclusions: Despite the fact that some of the workers' beliefs are inconsistent with current scientific view, their actual intuitive practices are consistent with the scientific paradigm. Specific emphasis has to be placed on encouraging workers' intuitive approach to ADRD and providing workers with ample information about the medical conditions and needs of the care recipient.","Attitudes; Cross-cultural; Dementia; Domestic care; Formal caregiving; Knowledge; Migrant workers","Alzheimer disease; article; behavioral science; clinical practice; controlled study; dementia; geriatric care; home care; interview; Israel; migrant worker; Philippines; priority journal; adult; Asian; attitude to health; cultural factor; ethnology; female; health care personnel; human; male; migration; nursing; psychological aspect; qualitative research; questionnaire; Acculturation; Adult; Alzheimer Disease; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Home Health Aides; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Israel; Male; Philippines; Qualitative Research; Questionnaires; Transients and Migrants",,,,,,,,"Aiken, L.H., US nurse labor market dynamics are key to global nurse sufficiency (2007) Health Services Research, 42, pp. 1299-1320; Ayalon, L., Family and Family-like Transfers Within Around the Clock Foreign Home Care System, , Manuscript submitted for publication.

This study aims to explain these differences using quantitative and qualitative methods. Methods: A total of 153 peri- and postmenopausal women aged 45-55 years (52 UKA, 51 UKC and 50 DEL) were interviewed about their experience of menopause, lifestyle and health. The current study combines a quantitative analysis of potential predictors (sociodemographic variables, mood, lifestyle, ethnicity, country of residence and religion) of vasomotor symptoms and a qualitative thematic content analysis of descriptions of experience of menopause. Results: Country of residence and anxiety best predicted vasomotor symptoms, while religion, ethnicity, age of menopause and lifestyle factors did not. Within the UK Asian sample, poor general health, anxiety and less acculturation were predictors of vasomotor symptoms. Qualitative analyses revealed cultural differences in symptoms and beliefs about the menopause. Conclusions: These results challenge assumptions about migrated Asian populations living in western cultures and the qualitative data provides information that might increase understanding of the experience and meanings of menopause amongst migrated Asian communities. © 2009 International Menopause Society.","Asian women; Culture; Ethnicity; Health; Menopause; Qualitative study","adult; anxiety; article; Asian; Caucasian; content analysis; controlled study; cultural factor; ethnicity; female; health belief; human; India; interview; lifestyle; menopause; mood; personal experience; postmenopause; predictor variable; priority journal; quantitative analysis; quantitative study; religion; residential area; thematic analysis; United Kingdom; vasomotor reflex; women's health; Affect; Anxiety; Cross-Sectional Studies; Educational Status; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Great Britain; Hot Flashes; Humans; India; Life Style; Marital Status; Menopause; Middle Aged; Perimenopause; Postmenopause; Questionnaires; Religion; Vasomotor System; Women's Health",,,,,,,,"Avis, N.E., Assmann, S.F., Kravitz, H.M., Ganz, P.A., Ory, M., Quality of life in diverse groups of midlife women: Assessing the influence of menopause, health status and psychosocial and demographic factors (2004) Qual Life Res, 13, pp. 933-946; Lock, M., Cross-cultural vasomotor symptom reporting: Conceptual and methodological issues (2005) Menopause, 12, pp. 239-241; Melby, M.K., Lock, M., Kaufert, P., Culture and symptom reporting at menopause (2005) Hum Reprod Update, 11, pp. 495-512; Flint, M., The menopause: Reward or punishment?

Cultural differences in maternity care may result in conflict between migrants and healthcare providers, especially when migrants have minimal English language knowledge. The aim of the study was to investigate Asian migrant women's child-birth experiences in a rural Australian context. METHOD: The study consisted of semi-structured interviews conducted with 10 Asian migrant women living in rural Tasmania to explore their childbirth experiences and the barriers they faced in accessing maternal care in the new land. The data were analysed using grounded theory and three main categories were identified: 'migrants with traditional practices in the new land', 'support and postnatal experiences' and 'barriers to accessing maternal care'. RESULTS: The findings revealed that Asian migrants in Tasmania faced language and cultural barriers when dealing with the new healthcare system. Because some Asian migrants retain traditional views and practices for maternity care, confusion and conflicting expectations may occur. Family and community play an important role in supporting migrant women through their maternity care. CONCLUSIONS: Providing interpreting services, social support for migrant women and improving the cross-cultural training for healthcare providers were recommended to improve available maternal care services.",,"adaptive behavior; article; Asian; attitude to health; Australia; birth; cultural anthropology; cultural competence; cultural factor; ethnology; family; female; health care delivery; health service; human; methodology; migration; nursing methodology research; organization and management; postnatal care; pregnancy; psychological aspect; qualitative research; questionnaire; rural health care; social support; Acculturation; Adaptation, Psychological; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Attitude to Health; Cultural Competency; Cultural Diversity; Family; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Services Accessibility; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Maternal Health Services; Nursing Methodology Research; Parturition; Postnatal Care; Pregnancy; Qualitative Research; Questionnaires; Rural Health Services; Social Support; Tasmania; Transients and Migrants; MLCS; MLOWN",,,,,,,,,"Hoang, H.T.",,,,,,,,14456354,,,"19243226","English","Rural Remote Health",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-65249185791

The foundations for a micro-sociology of ethnic relations laid by Max Weber in 1906-11 have to be interrelated with the macro-sociological contexts within which ethnic groups are constructed by collective action. When ethnic relations have their origin in trans-national migration, much depends on the immigrants' points of entry into the receiving society's scale of socio-economic status, and, thereafter, on transmitted inequalities. While the nature and causes of social differences associated with ethnic origin have been illuminated by quantitative and qualitative studies, new styles of research are needed to bridge these modes of analysis, such as the measurement of relative preferences for association with co-ethnics.","Assimilation; Collective action; Ethnic group; Ethnic relations; Immigration; Max Weber","acculturation; collective action; cultural relations; ethnic conflict; ethnic group; immigration; qualitative analysis; social policy; socioeconomic status",,,,,,,,"Alvarez, V., Aurora, D., Howard, M., Building a Tatar elite: Language and national schooling in Kazan (2007) Ethnicities, pp. 186-207; (1994) Desh Pardesh: The South Asian Presence in Britain, , Hurst, London; Banton, M., (1967) Race Relations, , Tavistock, London; Banton, M., (1983) Racial and Ethnic Competition, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Banton, M., Ethnic conflict (2000) Sociology, pp. 481-498; Banton, M., Max Weber on ""Ethnic Communities"" a critique (2007) Nations and Nationalism, pp. 19-35; Brubaker, R., The return of assimilation?

Such acculturation of immigrant groups occurs as part of the interaction of immigrants with mainstream culture. This study examined the acculturation of Ghanaian immigrants in Greater Toronto Area (Canada) focusing particularly on attitudes towards and usage of Ghanaian traditional medicine (TRM). Methods: The study used both quantitative and qualitative methods. Structured questionnaire interviews were conducted with a sample of Ghanaians in active collaboration with the Ghanaian-Canadian Association in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). A total of 512 questionnaire interviews were conducted. In addition, three focus groups of nine participants each were conducted with a sub-sample of Ghanaians in Canada. Results: Both the questionnaire and the focus groups indicated that nearly 73% of the Ghanaian immigrants in Canada have a positive attitude toward Ghanaian TRM. This is in comparison with less than 30% who have changed their attitude for various reasons. Some of the attraction of TRM lies in its holistic origin. Ghanaians in the GTA have been pursuing 'integration' and 'assimilation' in their acculturation in Canada. Some have given up or modified some of their attitudes and opinions toward TRM to embrace the 'modern' or 'civilized' way of living. Conclusion: There is the need for health care providers and other stakeholders to be aware of the influence of religion on African immigrants during their acculturation process. Although modernity is said to be founded on the 'ruthless undermining of tradition', there is no evidence to suggest that Ghanaian traditional religion has been undermined to such an extent that there is a major change in attitudes towards TRM. © 2008 Barimah and van Teijlingen; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"adult; African medicine; aged; article; attitude to health; Canada; cultural factor; cultural value; ethnicity; female; Ghana; health belief; human; immigrant; lifestyle; male; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; questionnaire; religion; social status; cultural factor; ethnology; Ghana; health behavior; information processing; middle aged; migration; patient attitude; religion; statistics; Acculturation; Adult; Attitude to Health; Emigration and Immigration; Female; Focus Groups; Ghana; Health Behavior; Humans; Medicine, African Traditional; Middle Aged; Ontario; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Questionnaires; Religion and Medicine; Spirituality",,,,,,,,"Twumasi, P.A., (1975) Medical Systems in Ghana: A Study in Medical Sociology, , Tema: Ghana Publishing Co; Herberg, D.C., A framework for the settlement and integration of immigrants (1990) Proceedings of the Settlement and Integration of New Immigrants to Canada Conference, pp. 27-43. , Waterloo: Wilfrid Laurier University Yelaja SA; Opoku-Dapaah, E., (1993) Adaptation of Ghanaian Immigrants in Toronto, , North York, Canada: York Lanes; Owusu, T., (1996) The Adaptation of Black African Immigrants in Canada: A Case Study of Residential Behaviour and Ethnic Community Formation Among Ghanaians in Toronto, , (Unpublished PhD) Toronto: University of Toronto; Donkor, M., (2000) The Education of Women: Prospects and Challenges for Ghanaian Immigrant Women, , (Unpublished PhD) Toronto: University of Toronto; Okore, E.N., (2000) Adaptation of Ghanaian Immigrants in Metropolitan Toronto: A Focus on the Spatial Aspects of Their Labour Market Activity, , (Unpublished PhD) Waterloo, Canada: Wilfrid Laurier University; Willcox, M.L., Bodeker, G., Traditional herbal medicines for malaria (2004) Brit Med J, 329, pp. 1156-1159. , 527695 15539672 10.1136/bmj.329.7475.1156; Evans-Anfom, E., (1986) Traditional Medicine in Ghana: Practice, Problems and Prospects, , Accra: Ghana Academy of Arts and Science; Blue, A.W., Blue, M.A., The trial of stress (1984) Multiculturalism in Canada, pp. 93-125. , Toronto: Allyn and Bacon Samuda, RJ, Berry, JW, Laferriere M; Taylor, J.G., (1983) From Modernization to Modes of Production, , London: The Macmillan Press; Owoahene-Acheampong, S., (1998) Inculturation and African Religion: Indegenous and Western Approaches to Medical Practice, , New York: Peter Lang Publishing; Maduro, O., (1982) Religion and Social Conflicts, , Maryknoll: Orbis Books; Dunn, J.R., Dyck, I., Social determinants of health in Canada's immigrant populations: Results from the National Population Health Survey (2000) Soc Sc Med, 51, pp. 1573-1593. , 10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00053-8 11072880; Chen, J., Ng, E., Wilkins, R., The Health of Canada's immigrants in 1994-95 (1996) Health Rep, 7, pp. 33-45. , 8679956; Disman, M., Processing of the settlement and integration of new immigrants to Canada Conference (1990) The Process of Adaptation of Immigrants to Canadian Culture and Communities, pp. 45-62. , Waterloo: Wilfrid Laurier University Yelaja SA; Berger, E., (1990) The Canadian Health Monitor.

Within the questionnaire survey, 126 first-generation immigrants in Prague (51 Ukrainians, 45 Vietnamese, and 30 Armenians) were successfully contacted via a non-probability sampling method. The main goals of the research were to ascertain what mode of inclusion into Czech society the immigrant groups practiced and to determine their satisfaction level with their new lives. Special attention was paid to finding out important factors that stand behind both the common features and particular patterns of behaviour. Our approach is an attempt to analyse the issue via quantitative statistics (Chi-square Test, the AnswerTree Method). Berry's (1992) acculturation strategies model and Portes and Zhou's (e.g. 2000) segmented assimilation model serve as reference points while discussing conceptual matters. The results indicate that the immigrants' inclusion in Czech society in Prague has developed into specific modes: Ukrainians are typical of their specific transnationalization patterns, Vietnamese represent a ""well-off""but separated and segregated community, and Armenians practice a clear assimilation strategy, while approaching the mainstream in terms of socio-economic status. Based on various indications, it seems that successful inclusion in Czech society is connected to the assimilation mode. In sum, the immigrants most satisfied with their quality of life are those for whom it is not important to live close to their compatriots and those whose knowledge of the spoken Czech language is above average. The lowest satisfaction score is tied to those immigrants who prefer to live close to their compatriots, those with university education, and those with a low income. Good knowledge of the Czech language seems to be a gateway to immigrants' satisfaction. © 2007 IOM.",,"immigrant; international migration; quantitative analysis; questionnaire survey; sampling; Central Europe; Czech Republic; Eurasia; Europe",,,,,,,,"(2003) Migration: Immigration and Emigration in International Perspective, , Adler, L.L., and U.P.

Globalization and the cultural safety of an immigrant Muslim community Aim. This paper reports a study the aim of which was to further understanding of cultural safety by focusing on the social health of a small immigrant community of Muslims in a relatively homogeneous region of Canada following the terror attacks on 11 September 2001 (9/11). Background. The aftermath of 9/11 negatively affected Muslims living in many centers of Western Europe and North America. Little is known about the social health of Muslims in smaller areas with little cultural diversity. Developed by Maori nurses, the cultural safety concept captures the negative health effects of inequities experienced by the indigenous people of New Zealand. Nurses in Canada have used the concept to understand the health of Aboriginal peoples. It has also been used to investigate the nursing care of immigrants in a Canadian metropolitan centre. Findings indicated, however, that the dichotomy between culturally safe and unsafe groups was blurred. Method. The methodology was qualitative, based on the constructivist paradigm. A purposive sample of 26 Muslims of Middle Eastern, Indian or Pakistani origin and residing in the province of New Brunswick, Canada were interviewed in 2002-2003. Findings. Participants experienced a sudden transition from cultural safety to cultural risk following 9/11. Their experience of cultural safety included a sense of social integration in the community and invisibility as a minority. Cultural risk stemmed from being in the spotlight of an international media and becoming a visible minority. Conclusion. Cultural risk is not necessarily rooted in historical events and may be generated by outside forces rather than by longstanding inequities in relationships between groups within the community. Nurses need to think about the cultural safety of their practices when caring for members of socially disadvantaged cultural minority groups as this may affect the health services delivered to them. © 2007 The Author.","Community; Cultural issues; Multicultural issues; Qualitative approaches; Stress; Transcultural nursing","adult; aged; article; Canada; cultural anthropology; female; human; international cooperation; male; middle aged; migration; minority group; psychological aspect; questionnaire; religion; safety; social psychology; terrorism; Adult; Aged; Canada; Culture; Emigration and Immigration; Female; Humans; Internationality; Islam; Male; Middle Aged; Minority Groups; Prejudice; Questionnaires; Safety; Terrorism",,,,,,,,"Anderson, J., Perry, J., Blue, C., Browne, A., Rewriting' cultural safety with the postcolonial and postnational feminist project: Toward new epistemologies of healing (2003) Advances in Nursing Science, 26 (3), pp. 196-205; Appleton, J., King, L., Constructivism: A naturalistic methodology (1997) Advances in Nursing Science, 20 (2), pp. 13-22; (2002) Canadian Islamic Congress (2002) Anti-Islam in the media, , http://www.canadianislamiccongress.com, Retrieved from; Collins, J., David, R., Symms, R., Handler, A., Wall, S., Dwyer, L., Low income African-American mothers' perception of exposure o racial discrimination and infant birth weight (2000) Epidemiology, 11, pp. 337-339; Denzin, N., (1989) The Research Art: A Theoretical Introduction to Sociological Methods, , 3rd edn.

Method: A two-part research strategy using both quantitative and qualitative methods was employed. In the cross-sectional quantitative survey, 113 Chinese respondents completed a questionnaire investigating demographic factors, life experiences associated with migration, proficiency in the English language and mental health status. In the qualitative phase of the research, interviews were conducted with a further 24 immigrants to explore these factors in more depth. Results: In the questionnaire survey, over 60% of the group reported symptoms of poor mental health. Qualitative research shows that for those who were employed in catering, psychological adjustment was heavily dependent on strong ties with the Chinese community and there was minimal contact with the host society. By contrast, those concerned with professional development experienced conflict as a result of a high perceived need for integration and a recognition of the problems associated with this. Conclusion: The psychological distress experienced by immigrants of Chinese origin continues to be a largely invisible cause for concern. © 2006 Taylor and Francis.","Chinese; Immigrant; Life adjustment; Mental health","adult; article; Asian; China; cross-sectional study; cultural factor; ethnology; female; health; health survey; human; male; mental disease; mental health; middle aged; migration; psychological aspect; qualitative research; questionnaire; social adaptation; social support; United Kingdom; Acculturation; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Emigration and Immigration; Female; Great Britain; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Qualitative Research; Questionnaires; Social Adjustment; Social Support; Urban Health",,,,,,,,"Bagley, C.R., Mental health and social adjustment of elderly Chinese immigrants in Canada (1993) Canada's Mental Health, 41, pp. 6-10; Bagley, C., Madrid, S., Bolitho, F., Stress factors and mental health adjustment of Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong (1997) International Social Work, 40, pp. 373-382; Beiser, M., Hou, F., Language acquisition, unemployment and depressive disorder among Southeast Asian refugees: A 10-year study (2001) Social Science and Medicine, 53 (10), pp. 1321-1334. , DOI 10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00412-3, PII S0277953600004123; Brewster, E.T., Brewster, E.S., (1976) Language Acquisition Made Practical, , Lingua House, Colorado Springs; Burgess, R., Elements of sampling in field research (1982) Field Research: A Sourcebook and Field Manual, pp. 75-78. , R.

The study is based on a survey of 300 immigrants (from the USA, Japan, Iraq, former-Yugoslavia, Morocco and the Dutch Antilles) living in the Netherlands. The respondents are deliberately chosen to include different categories of immigrants. Transnational activities constitute a substantial part of their lives and are to a large extent socio-cultural. Many migrants also transfer money abroad. Professional economic activities were rare and mainly limited to the American group. As a whole, our respondents identify more with other compatriots living in the Netherlands than with people living outside the Netherlands. The research also found that transnational involvement in general does not impede 'immigrant integration'. Migrant groups that are known as poorly integrated into Dutch society are not more involved in transnational activities and have no stronger identifications with the country of origin than other groups. However, within the Moroccan and Antillean groups those respondents with the weakest labour market position identify more strongly with the country of origin than others. Strong identifications with compatriots living elsewhere and withdrawal from Dutch society may reinforce their poor labour market integration © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd & Global Networks Partnership.",,"Quantitative examination; Social integration; Transnational activities; Professional aspects; Regional planning; Social sciences; Social aspects; economic activity; immigrant population; labor market; quantitative analysis; socioeconomic impact; transmigration; Africa; Asia; Atlantic islands; Atlantic Ocean; Caribbean Islands; Eurasia; Far East; Iraq; Japan; Lesser Antilles; Middle East; Morocco; Netherlands Antilles; North Africa; North America; United States; Yugoslavia (pre-1992)",,,,,,,,"Al-Ali, N., Black, R., Koser, K., Refugees and transnationalism: The experience of Bosnians and Eritreans in Europe (2001) Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 27, pp. 615-634; Alba, R., Nee, V., Rethinking assimilation theory for a new era of immigration (1997) International Migration Review, 31, pp. 26-74; Bauman, Z., (2004) Identity, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Berry, J.W., Sam, D.L., Acculturation and adaptation (1996) Handbook of Cross-cultural Psychology, 3, pp. 291-326. , J.

The major issues involve the question of dimensionality and the assessment of specific domains of cultural change. Bidimensional scales that cover both overt and internal domains are more informative for the assessment of general levels of psychological acculturation. The validity of such scales must be examined in terms of the actual exposure of individuals to and involvement in each culture, and the influence of sociocultural factors on the course of acculturation. The parallel application of qualitative and quantitative methods may be useful for validity studies. The complementary use of emic and etic approaches will enhance the psychometric soundness of acculturation scales. © 2006, Sage Publications.

It uses quantitative methods, and statistical data from a 1992 INSEE-INED survey entitled «Mobilité Géographique et Insertion Sociale» (MGIS; Geographic mobility and social integration). Taking off from literature stressing the multidimensional, segmented character of the immigrant integration process, the research worked to develop an empirical typology of that process that would allow for testing the relevance of various models. It shows that the classic integration hypothesis, which posits the existence of a uniform convergence process, is only validated for the case of Spanish immigrants. The other communities represented in the survey seem characterized by more complex and further segmented models.",,,,,,,,,,"Alba, R.D., Golden, R.M., Patterns of ethnic marriage in the United States (1986) Social Forces, 65 (1), pp. 202-223; Alba, R.D., Nee, V., Rethinking assimilation theory for a new era of immigration (1997) International Migration Review, 31 (4), pp. 826-874; Alexander, J.C., Theorizing the modes of incorporation: Assimilation, hyphenation, and multiculturalism as varieties of civil participation (2001) Sociological Theory, 19 (3), pp. 237-249; Baillet, G.D., (2001) Militantisme Politique et Intégration des Jeunes D'origine Maghrébine, , Paris, L'Harmattan; Becker, G., (1957) Human Capital, , Chicago, University of Chicago Press; Becker, H.S., (1985) Outsiders, , [1963], Paris, A.

More specifically, we employ categorical data clustering to analyze the cross-cultural adaptation process of immigrants in a foreign cultural environment. To assess the extend to which individuals adapt themselves in a strange cultural environment we performed an experiment, where a set of cross-cultural categorical data was generated by using a questionnaire over a number of immigrants who live in Greece. The key idea is to cluster the available categorical data and to treat these clusters as patterns, each of which corresponds to a certain level of adaptation capability. Then, we detect and analyze changes of these patterns through time. These changes directly indicate how the cross-cultural adaptation process proceeds. In order to cluster the available data set we use the well-known ROCK algorithm. © 2005 IEEE.",,"Adaptation capability; Categorical data clustering; Cross cultural adaptation process; Foreign cultural environment; Data reduction; Data structures; Distributed database systems; Knowledge acquisition; Social aspects; Data processing",,,,,,,,"Kim, Y.Y., (1988) Communication and cross-cultural adaptation: An integrative theory, , Multilingual Matters Ltd, England; Cushner, K., Brislin, R.W., (1997) Improving Intercultural Interactions: Modules for Cross-Cultural Training Programs, 2. , Sage Publications, Beverly Hills; Tsekouras, G., Bantimaroudis, P., Ross, S.D., (2001) Political Analysis, , A fuzzy logic approach to changing media portrayals of Arafat and Sharon following the cataclysmic events of Sept. 11, In review; S.D.

Their presence in France started in the second half of the XIX century. The characteristics of Italian migrations have changed over time, due to the geographic origin, the areas of settlement, the sex and age composition, the kind of activities carried out. In spite of the differences, Italian migration is considered a successful one, that is, ""integrated, absorbed immigration"" in French society. The essay analyses the evolution of the Italian presence in France between 1970 and 2005, with a particular focus on geographic distribution, the differences between regional groups, migratory paths and the social-professional insertaion. Through this analysis, the inner differences within the group of Italian migrants is brought to light: consequently, one should question whether it is correct to speak about Italian immigration in France as a whole. The example of Italians in Provence - based on a qualitative survey comparing the two groups of migrants coming from Piedmont and Sicily - may help to understand the differences within the category ""Italian immigrants"", the processes of insertion and the role of the personal networks as channels of access to ""opportunities"", and likely element of reduction of the effects of destabilization inherent to migration flows in the years of the oil crisis. The perspective adopted in the article is multidisciplinary, with a particular attention to history and micro history, and the sociological tradition of ""mobility studies"". The comparative and micro-analytic dimension allows for a deep analysis of the contexts in which these phenomena of mobility can take place and the factors that determine them.",,"acculturation; immigrant population; population distribution; Eurasia; Europe; France; Western Europe",,,,,,,,"Dupaquier, J., (1988) Histoire De La Population Française, III, De 1789 à 1914, p. 216. , Paris, PUF; Noriel, G., (1988) Le Creuset Français.

In effetti, oltre alla mobilità professionale, un'altra causa di cambiamento di abitazione riguarda la nascita dei figli che segna, ugualmente, il momento in cui, spesso, le famiglie decidono di trasferirsi nei paesi dell'hinterland urbano; Sirna, F., (1945) Partir, Revenir, Rester: Les Migrations Des Piémontais Et Des Siciliens En Provence (1945-2004), , Cfr. Ad ogni modo, la dispersione non significa la rottura dei legami con gli altri immigrati. I parenti o gli amici più intimi, sovente seguono lo stesso percorso residenziale. I rapporti con gli altri immigrati meno prossimi tendono a distanziarsi attraverso un processo che Maurizio Catani ha definito d'individualizzazione; Catani, M., Les migrants et leurs descendants entre individuel et allégeance chthonienne (1986) «Cahiers Internationaux De Sociologie», 81, pp. 281-298; (1996) La Population Immigrée. Le Résultat D'une Longue Histoire, (458). , Dal 1946 al 1972 gli stranieri naturalizzati sono in maggioranza polacchi ed italiani, seguiti dagli spagnoli. Nel 1946 su cento dossier di naturalizzazione, il 46,4% sono di italiani, nel 1954 la percentual di naturalizzazioni, pur scendendo al 38,8%, conferma gli italiani al primo posta tra gli stranieri che acquisiscono la nazionalità francese. Secondo i dati del censimento dell popolazione francese del 1982, gli italiani rappresentano il 29,2% degli stanieri naturalizzati (417.300 effettivi), contro il 18,8% di spagnoli (269.000), il 4,79% di portoghesi (68.300), il 5,02% di algerini (72.300), il 2,2% di marocchini (31.800) ed il 3,08% di tunisini (43.900). I dati del censimento del 1990 attestano una stabilizzazione dell proporzione dei naturalizzati rispetto al totale della popolazion francese al 2,3% (1.300.000 effetivi).

Design and subjects: Cross-sectional analyses were performed for ethnic Koreans who participated in the Multiethnic Cohort Study in Hawaii and Los Angeles in 1993-1996. The sample included 492 Korean American women aged 45-75 years who were born in the USA (n = 274) or Korea (n = 218). Participants were recruited using driver's license files as a primary sampling source and completed a self-administered questionnaire, including a quantitative food frequency section. Results: The proportion overweight or obese was 31.4% in US-born and 9-4% in Korea-born women. US-born women had higher intakes of total fat and fat as a percentage of energy, and lower intakes of sodium, vitamin C, β-carotene and carbohydrate as a percentage of energy, than Korea-born women. Comparing intakes of food group servings from the Food Guide Pyramid, US-born women reported more whole grains, red meat and nuts, and less soy products, than did Korea-born women. US-born women also consumed fewer vegetables and fruit than those born in Korea. Few women in either group reported intakes that met the recommendations for dairy foods. Intake of discretionary fat from the Pyramid tip was higher in US-born than in Korea-born women. Conclusions: These findings indicate that the acculturation of Korean immigrants affects dietary intakes in ways that may alter risks of several chronic diseases. Further studies will be necessary to examine the effects of dietary acculturation on disease patterns. © The Authors 2005.","Acculturation; Food group intakes; Health-related behaviours; Immigrants; Korean Americans; Nutrient intakes","ascorbic acid; beta carotene; carbohydrate; fat; sodium; adult; aged; article; Asian American; carbohydrate intake; chronic disease; cohort analysis; cultural factor; dairy product; dietary intake; driver licence; energy; ethnology; fat intake; female; food intake; grain; health behavior; human; Korea; meat; nut; obesity; priority journal; quantitative analysis; questionnaire; risk; sodium intake; soybean; United States; vegetable; vitamin intake; Acculturation; Aged; Asian Americans; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dietary Fats; Energy Intake; Ethnic Groups; Female; Food Habits; Humans; Korea; Middle Aged; Nutrition Policy; Obesity; United States; Glycine max",,"ascorbic acid, 134-03-2, 15421-15-5, 50-81-7; beta carotene, 7235-40-7; sodium, 7440-23-5; Dietary Fats",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH: R37 CA 54 281

This cross-sectional study used both quantitative and qualitative approaches to establish the impact of migration on women from Britain (n = 154) now living in Perth, Western Australia; from these participants 40 were selected for in-depth interview. Bowlby's grieving process was used as a theoretical framework to explore grief reactions to leaving the homeland (homesickness) resulting from exposure to a new culture. Crucial to successful settlement was the nature of strategies the women used to negotiate the grieving process. Participants who successfully settled and re-invented themselves engaged in more social, cultural and country activities - those participants who were less successful in this endeavour tended toward more solitary strategies. The study has social implications for future migrants to utilize appropriate strategies that could reduce the psychological impact of relocation. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Bowlby; Migration; Settlement; Strategies","adaptive behavior; adult; aged; article; Australia; cross-sectional study; cultural factor; ethnology; family; female; friend; grief; human; information processing; interpersonal communication; life event; middle aged; migration; nursing methodology research; psychological aspect; qualitative research; questionnaire; social behavior; United Kingdom; Acculturation; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Emigration and Immigration; Family; Female; Focus Groups; Friends; Great Britain; Grief; Humans; Life Change Events; Middle Aged; Negotiating; Nursing Methodology Research; Qualitative Research; Questionnaires; Social Behavior; Social Identification; Western Australia; Women",,,,,,,,"Akhtar, S., (1999) Immigration and Identity.

In 1999, after 45 years of ""feeling shame and a sense of guilt"" (Lee, 1999, para. 3) First Lady Hee-Ho Lee marked the South Korean government's official recognition of adoptees as overseas Koreans. As involuntary immigrants, this population has both shared and unique experiences with other Korean immigrants. Current literature on Asian American acculturation, assimilation, and identity does not capture the experiences of Asian adoptees (McDonald and Balgopal, 1998; Min and Kim, 2000; Oyserman and Sakamoto, 1997; Phinney et al., 2000; Tse, 1999). This article presents quantitative research that considered the constructs of ethnic and racial identity for Korean adoptees, their relationship to each other, and to the process of acculturation. This study of adoptees (N = 69), ranging in age from early-adolescence to young adulthood, explored the relationships between racial identity, ethnic identity, and acculturation in transracial Korean adoptees. The research was exploratory in nature and entailed a quantitative design comprised of three objective instruments measuring racial identity, ethnic identity, and acculturation. Findings indicated that the group was characterized as embracing both their Korean heritage and white middle-class upbringing with a somewhat greater need for assimilation or inclusion into the Korean community than differentiation from it. While adoptees are highly acculturated into the mainstream, they seem to journey, as do other immigrants, through a process of defining what ethnicity and race means to them. © 2003 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Recent studies of transnationalism introduce a more complex back-and-forth variety of migration, providing ways to explain differences among migratory subgroups. Building on segmented assimilation and transnationalism perspectives, this research addresses the maze of adjustment processes encountered by participants in this study-Latina teenagers who recently immigrated to the U.S. and attend a mid-western high school. This paper proposes an integrated model of gender and acculturation by focusing on adaptation processes. Using qualitative data gathered through group interviews, observation, and survey, the study examines how interaction is organized around gender, ethnicity, and immigrant status. The Latinas invoke ethnic identity to resist an American gender order. However, institutional structures, such as English-as-Second-Language classes, shape practices that have differential effects for girls and boys. Latinas are subject to harsher control both within families and the conformist school culture, which marks them as outsiders more than it does their male peers. These practices reveal the gendered makeup of interaction as distinct from characteristics and beliefs of the individual, and adjustment processes as segmented along structural gender lines. A gendered ethnicity and ethnic gendering reinforces the gender order, but in a way specific to local gender practices and immigrant status.",,,,,,,,,,"Alba, R., Nee, V., Rethinking assimilation theory for a new era of immigration (1997) The International Migration Review, 31, pp. 826-875; Althusser, L., Ideology and ideological stale apparatuses (1971) Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays, pp. 127-186. , London: New Left Books; (1991) Shortchanging Girls, Shortchanging America, , Researched by Greenberg-Lake: The Analysis Group.

This was a cross-sectional study consisting of quantitative and qualitative phases. Using convenience sampling methods, 54 Korean immigrant women were recruited for the quantitative phase, and 15 women among them were recruited for the qualitative phase. Questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were used to collect data. The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics and thematic analysis. The findings indicated that the women's needs for and attitudes toward physical activity were influenced by the contexts of their culture and immigration, and deeply associated with the women's daily experiences.

Significant analysis of covariance and post hoc comparison results revealed meaningful main effects and interactions between acculturation and Asian identity in explaining the immigrants' quality of life and ecocultural aspects of their home environments. Interview responses illuminated important distinctions between groups distinguished by level of acculturation and ethnic identity. Findings are discussed in terms of methodological and conceptual issues in studying acculturation and ethnic identity in immigration experiences and practical implications for immigrants and those working with them.","Acculturation; Chinese immigrants; Ethnic identity; Immigration; Mixed methodology; Qualitative methodology; Quality of life","adult; article; Asian American; Chinese; cultural factor; ethnic difference; female; health survey; home; human; identity; immigrant; male; methodology; quality of life; social class; social environment; Acculturation; Adult; Aged; China; Culture; Emigration and Immigration; Ethnic Groups; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Social Identification; United States",,,,,"Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD: P01HD011944, R01HD031856",,,"Arnold, F., Minocha, U., Fawcett, T., The changing face of Asian immigration to the United States (1987) Pacific bridges: The new immigration from Asia and the Pacific Islands, pp. 105-152. , J.

Method: A quantitative survey of 2573 school students attending Years 10 and 11 from 12 high schools with a high Vietnamese and Arabic population was conducted in Sydney in 1998. Self-reported marijuana use, school and cultural background information was collected. Results: Students from an English-speaking background, both males and females, had almost double the prevalence of marijuana use (once or more) during their lifetime (48.3 and 43.6%), the 12 months (40.9 and 36.3%) and 1 month prior to survey administration (23.1 and 13.4%) than the group with the second highest frequency of use (students of European and other backgrounds). Female Vietnamese (7.3% lifetime use) and Arabic students (8.6% lifetime use) had the lowest marijuana use rates, which were less than half that of male Vietnamese (23.5% lifetime use.) and Arabic students (28% lifetime use.). A similar pattern was found for three types of alcohol use. Spending three or more evenings a week out with friends was associated with higher alcohol use for Vietnamese students (relative risk ratio of 2.76). Conclusions: These results confirm lower marijuana and alcohol use among students from Vietnamese- and Arabic- speaking backgrounds compared with students from an English-speaking background. Harm minimization strategies may be learned from some migrant communities.","Acculturation; Adolescents; Alcohol; Marijuana; Migrant research","alcohol; cannabis; adolescent; alcohol consumption; article; Australia; controlled study; cultural factor; drug use; ethnology; female; human; language; major clinical study; male; prevalence; priority journal; risk assessment; school; self report; sex difference; social aspect; Acculturation; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Alcohol Drinking; Arabs; Australia; Female; Humans; Male; Marijuana Smoking; Transients and Migrants; Vietnam",,,,,,,,"Cooney, A., Dobbinson, S., Flaherty, B., (1993) Survey of Drug Use by NSW Secondary Students 1992 Survey, , New South Wales Drug and Alcohol Directorate, Sydney; Hill, D., White, V., Segan, C., Prevalence of cigarette smoking among Australian secondary school students in 1993 (1995) Aust.

Within the framework of this project, woman and men coming from the former Soviet Union and resettling in Germany were gradually investigated and compared with male and female migrant laborers from Turkey and with West German women and men on the basis of quantitative and qualitative surveys. The aim of investigation was to reveal different aspects of the process of acculturation and integration undergone by groups having immigrated into the Federal Republic of Germany. The project centered on the following issues: changes in gender role and immigration, conditions of socialization and pedagogical attitudes of the families, family orientation, professional and educational orientation, formation of stereotypes, as well as processes of comparison and of identification.",,,,,,,,,,"Bem, S., The Measurement of Pcychological Androgyny (1974) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Pychology, 42 (2), pp. 155-162; Connell, R.W., Neue Richtungen für Geschlechtertheorie, Männlichkeitsforschung und Geschlechterpolitik (1995) Neue Horizonte?

The changes that occur can influence the way they live and think as well as their personal health. This is especially true with Korean women. However, we still do not have sufficient knowledge about how these women adjust to their new environments. The rate of Korean immigration to the United States has gradually increased since 1965. According to Bouvier and Arnold, the Korean immigrant population is estimated to reach 1.3 million in the year 2000. Korea ranks fourth in number of emigrants, closely following the Philippines, China, and Vietnam. Research reveals that approximately 45% of recent emigrants are women, and this percentage is rapidly increasing. Research concerning this population's lives, their process of acculturation, and, above all, their health and well-being is lacking greatly in quantity and quality. This study demonstrates that the change of women's roles, due to their process of acculturation, cannot be considered separate from their well-being. For this study, 6 Korean women immigrants living in New York were chosen to provide information. The participants volunteered under the condition that their privacy and confidentiality would be protected. A pattern of acculturation experience was revealed in four successive, principal stages: dreams, conflicts, renunciation, and remorse. Hopefully, the following descriptive data will provide knowledge for implementing qualitative care requirements for Korean women immigrants in the United States.",,"adaptive behavior; adult; article; attitude to health; communication disorder; cultural factor; education; ethnology; female; gender identity; human; Korea; mental health; middle aged; migration; nursing methodology research; psychological aspect; psychological model; questionnaire; statistics; United States; women's health; Acculturation; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Communication Barriers; Emigration and Immigration; Female; Gender Identity; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Korea; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Models, Psychological; New York; Nursing Methodology Research; Questionnaires; Women; Women's Health",,,,,,,,"Berry, J.W., Kim, U., Acculturation and mental health: A review (1988) Cross-cultural Psychology and Health: Towards Applications, , P.

The remainder of the paper considers and rejects two common myths in the discussion of immigration: first, the myth of an immigrant underclass, and second, the myth of an immigrant overclass. Using research from Vancouver associated with the Metropolis Project, the first myth is challenged from an analysis of Census data that emphasizes the social context of immigrant life and upward mobility; the second myth is shaken by a qualitative methodology that reveals the unexpectedly fragile experience of a number of business immigrants.","Economic achievement; Immigration; Metropolis Project; Overclass; Social integration; Underclass","acculturation; identity construction; immigrant population; urban population; Canada",,,,,,,,"Baker, M., Benjamin, D., The receipt of transfer payments by immigrants to Canada' (1995) Journal of Human Resources, 30, pp. 650-676; Beattie, T., (1998) Integration and Segregation in German Churches in Greater Vancouver, , MA thesis, Department of Geography, University of British Columbia, Vancouver; (1997) BC StatS: Immigration Highlights, First Quarter 1997, , Issue 97-1 (Victoria: Ministry of Finance and Corporate Relations); Preliminary profile of immigrants landed in Canada over the 1980 to 1994 period (1997) CERF-CIC Conference on Immigration, Employment and the Economy, , paper presented Richmond, British Columbia, October; (1998) Statistical Tables on Inter-Provincial Mobil-ity from the IMDB Compendium Text and CD-ROM, , (Ottawa: Citizenship and Immigration Canada and Statistics Canada); Duncan, O.D., Lieberson, S., Ethnic segregation and assimilation (1959) American Journal of Sociology, 64, pp. 364-374; Ellis, M., Wright, R., The balkanization metaphor in the analysis of U.S. immigration (1998) Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 88, pp. 686-698; Farrow, M., Media right to follow money trail (1997) The Vancouver Courier, 23, p. 11. , March; Firey, W., Sentiment and symbolism as ecological variables (1945) American Sociological Review, 10, pp. 140-148; Frey, W., Immigration and internal migration'""flight"" from U.S. metropolitan areas: Toward a new balkanization (1995) Urban Studies, 32, pp. 733-757; Frey, W., Haw, K.-L., Immigration concentration and domestic migrant dispersal: Is movement to nonmetropolitan areas ""white flight""?

Legalization has produced important changes among immigrants and in immigration policy. These changes include new patterns of immigrant social and economic adaptation to the United States and new immigrant flows through family ties to IRCA-legalized aliens. The heightened salience of immigration, produced in part by legalization, has also generated a wave of ""backlash"" policymaking at the state and local levels in high-immigration sites. This article combines data from a longitudinal survey of the IRCA-legalized population with qualitative field data on current immigration issues from key informants in eight high-immigration metropolitan areas. It reviews the political evolution and early implementation of legalization, the current socioeconomic position of legalized aliens, and changes in the immigration policy space resulting from legalization. Although restrictive policies have again captured public attention, legalization has also sparked renewed efforts at immigration advocacy, particularly where immigrants who adjust to U.S. citizenship hold the potential for influencing local politics.",,"immigration policy; Immigration Reform and Control Act (1986); legalisation rate; policy change; undocumented immigrants; USA; article; cultural factor; Demographic Factors; demography; developed country; Economic Factors; economics; Illegal Migrants; Immigrants; International Migration; law; Migrants; migration; Migration Policy; North America; Northern America; policy; Political Factors; politics; population; population dynamics; Population Policy; social change; social class; social status; socioeconomics; United States; Western Hemisphere; Acculturation; Americas; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Economic Factors; Illegal Migrants; Immigrants; International Migration; Legislation; Migrants; Migration; Migration Policy; North America; Northern America; Policy; Political Factors; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Policy; Social Change; Social Policy; Socioeconomic Factors; Socioeconomic Status; United States; Acculturation; Americas; Demography; Developed Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Legislation; North America; Politics; Population; Population Dynamics; Public Policy; Social Change; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Transients and Migrants; United States",,,,,,,,"Baker, S.G., (1995) California and Catalunya: The Politics of Immigration Control in the United States of America and the Kingdom of Spain, , Unpublished manuscript; Immigration Reform: The Empowerment of a New Constituency (1993) Public Policy for Democracy, pp. 136-158. , Ed.

A culturally heterogenous sample of 54 war-wounded refugees was investigated during hospitalization shortly after arrival, and after two years. Quantitative data were covered by physical examinations, interviews and questionnaires. In addition, qualitative data were collected within semi-structured interviews on both occasions. The major types of war injuries were: fractures (22%), traumatic amputations (17%), spinal cord injuries (17%), nerve injuries (11%), combinations of fractures and nerve injuries (9%), bilateral eye injuries (9%), brain injuries (7%), other injuries (7%). Regarding the type of injuries and medical complications, the group studied was representative of small unit operations of war with low access to early medical care. The degree of physical disability was not a salient factor for well-being and social integration after two years in Sweden. The losses and desires to be repatriated were apparent from the qualitative findings, as exemplified by three case reports. The findings of this study are in accordance with previous research on refugees and war-injured ex-combatants, but further multidisciplinary research is needed. The results also imply that resettlement countries should pay continuous attention to the broad needs of their war-wounded refugees.",,"article; human; injury; longitudinal study; psychological aspect; refugee; social adaptation; Sweden; war; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Refugees; Social Adjustment; Sweden; War; Wounds and Injuries",,,,,,,,,"Hermansson, A.C.",,,,,,,,13623699,,,"8953262","English","Med Confl Surviv",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030254723

The factor structures of the 60-item and 28-item versions of the GHQ were examined to determine the cross-cultural validity of the four subscales of the 28-item GHQ “anxiety/insomnia”, “social dysfunction”, “severe depression” and “somatic complaints”. Four-factor principal components analyses yielded factors which corresponded to similar underlying traits, but the pattern of symptom loadings differed in several ways. Insomnia was less closely associated with anxiety, and general illness ratings such as “not feeling perfectly well” were not uniquely associated with somatic symptoms. The “anxiety/insomnia” and “severe depression” factors overlapped, with many symptoms partially correlated with both factors. These factors appeared to be due to variations in the frequency of occurrence of these symptoms rather than a qualitative distinction between anxiety and depression. © 1993, Sage Publications.
