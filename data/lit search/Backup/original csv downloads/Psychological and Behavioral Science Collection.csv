We addressed a bidimensional model of acculturation, considering both orientations toward home and host cultures, and assessed the relevance of Berry''s four-cell typology of acculturation (integration, assimilation, separation, and marginalization). Based on the unique characteristics of the present sample, including that they were all born in Korea and had been exposed to their home culture for a substantial amount of time, we hypothesized that their orientation towards original culture would be strong and that simple application of Berry''s four-cell typology would not be relevant. As expected, scores on Korean orientation were distributed toward the high end of the scale, suggesting a high level of familiarity and adherence to the original culture; scores on American orientation were correspondingly low. Cluster analysis showed that a two-cluster model was an optimal group classification in the sample used in this investigation. The groups were identified as “integrated group” and “separated group.” Compared to the separated group, integrated group was more likely to be younger, married, and educated. More years of residence in the U.S. and better physical and mental health were observed among those who were integrated. The findings call attention to the needs to consider the unique nature of immigrant samples in order to adequately apply the acculturation typologies.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=25596006&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

In 2018, multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine whether gender and race/ethnicity were associated with CRCS after controlling for sociodemographic, health access, and acculturation related factors. Overall, Asians were significantly less likely to report CRCS compared with Whites (aOR 0.63, CI 0.52–0.76). Hispanic race/ethnicity was negatively associated with CRCS among men (aOR 0.68, CI 0.50–0.91), but not women compared to white men/women, respectively. Additionally, factors associated with CRCS include having fair/poor health, usual source of care, insurance, ≥ 10 years of US residency and citizenship. Screening disparities experienced by these immigrants may be addressed by improving healthcare access, especially for noncitizens and those with limited healthcare access.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=143245312&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

The current study was designed to explain a person-centered approach to investigating acculturation and biculturalism and to illustrate this method with a sample of 315 Hispanic youth. Pattern analyses of the Hispanicism and Americanism scores from the Bicultural Involvement Scale yielded four distinct acculturation types, including one characterized by moderate scores on both scales. Relations between acculturation types and indicators of individual, family, and peer adaptation were tested. Results indicated that bicultural youth tended to show the most adaptive pattern of functioning across multiple sociocultural domains. Assimilated youth did not show as strongly negative a pattern as has been reported elsewhere. Implications and benefits of a person-centered approach are discussed. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Method: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in CINAHL Plus, Abstracts in Social Gerontology, AgeLine, Social Work Abstracts, PubMed, PsychINFO, and Social Science Citation Index databases to identify relevant articles that presented multivariate analysis results. Results: A total of 55 articles were identified, with the vast majority focusing on older Korean immigrants. The overall evidence showed that length of residence was largely unrelated to depression, and poor Enligsh proficiency also had a weak correlation with depression. However, a low level of acculturation measured by multidimensional scales was consistently associated with more depressive symptoms. Overall, living arrangements and the size and frequency of contact of both kin and non-kin networks were weak correlates of depression. In contrast, negative family and social interactions seem to be more consequential for depression in the two groups than positive relations and support. Conclusion: The findings show that established acculturation instruments are useful tools to identify at-risk older Chinese and Korean immigrants. Future studies need to further examine which aspects of acculturation experience are more influential for immigrants' mental health. Although often conceptualized as important coping resources, family and social networks could present significant stressors for older immigrants. Future research and services could focus on these contexts to improve the mental health of these two rapidly increasing Asian populations.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=134609583&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

We assessed access to and use of health services among Mexican-born undocumented immigrants living in New York City in 2004. Methods. We used venue-based sampling to recruit participants from locations where undocumented immigrants were likely to congregate. Participants were 18 years or older, born in Mexico, and current residents of New York City. The main outcome measures were health insurance coverage, access to a regular health care provider, and emergency department care. Results. In multivariable models, living in a residence with fewer other adults, linguistic acculturation, higher levels of formal income, higher levels of social support, and poor health were associated with health insurance coverage. Female gender, fewer children, arrival before 1997, higher levels of formal income, health insurance coverage, greater social support, and not reporting discrimination were associated with access to a regular health care provider. Higher levels of education, higher levels of formal income, and poor health were associated with emergency department care. Conclusions. Absent large-scale political solutions to the challenges of undocumented immigrants, policies that address factors shown to limit access to care may improve health among this growing population.

However, less is known about the potential psychosocial factors that may account for the health benefits of acculturation. As such, the current study seeks to understand how mainstream acculturation is associated with higher quality of life by investigating self-stigma, ambivalence over emotion expression (AEE), and intrusive thoughts, as serial mediators among Chinese breast cancer survivors.<bold>Methods: </bold>One hundred twelve Chinese American breast cancer survivors completed a self-reported questionnaire with these trait variables.<bold>Results: </bold>We found support for a serial multiple mediation hypothesis in which mainstream acculturation was indirectly associated with quality of life through self-stigma, AEE, and intrusive thoughts.

As Chinese immigrants acculturate to mainstream American culture, they may benefit from the reduced public stigma toward breast cancer and incorporate new post-immigration knowledge about cancer that protects them from high levels of self-stigma. This, in turn, may lead Chinese American breast cancer survivors to experience lower AEE and intrusive thoughts and subsequently experience higher quality of life.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=136270525&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis from a cohort study. SETTING: Urban and rural counties of the Central Valley of Northern California. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine Latinos recruited from a population-based sample (85% Mexican Americans) with a mean age of 70.6 (range 60–100; standard deviation (SD) = 7.13); 58.2% were women. MEASUREMENTS: Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies—Depression scale (CES-D). Acculturation was measured with the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans—II. Psychosocial, behavioral, and medical histories were also obtained. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression (CES-D ≥ 16) was 25.4%. Women were at greater risk (32.0%) than men (16.3%; male/female odds ratio (OR) = 2.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.90–3.09). The prevalence of depression was higher among immigrants (30.4%, OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.36–2.13), bicultural participants (24.2%, OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.24–2.24), and less-acculturated participants (36.1%, OR = 2.95, 95% CI = 2.22–3.93) compared with U.S.-born (20.5%) and more-acculturated groups (16.1%). When adjustments for education, income, psychosocial, behavioral, and health-problem factors were made, the least-acculturated participants were at significantly higher risk of depression than highly acculturated Mexican Americans (OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.06–2.31). CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with previously reported estimates of a higher prevalence of depression for older Mexican Americans than non-Hispanic Caucasians and African Americans and are the first to report the prevalence and risk of depression for older U.S.-born and immigrant Mexican Americans. The high prevalence of depression of the least acculturated group may be related to cultural barriers encountered by immigrants and less-acculturated older Mexican Americans and to poorer health status.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=5928486&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Assimilation was weakly endorsed towards both Jewish immigrants and Israeli Arabs.

The integrationism and individualism orientations were endorsed by undergraduates who were tolerant towards ethnic diversity, felt secure personally, culturally, and militarily, and did not endorse the social dominance orientation (SDO). In addition to not feeling threatened by the presence of Israeli Arabs, integrationists and individualists were identified as secular Israelis and Labour Party sympathizers rather than as religious Jews. In contrast, the assimilationism, segregationism, and exclusionism orientations were endorsed by undergraduates who felt insecure personally, religiously, culturally, and militarily, who tended to be less tolerant towards ethnic diversity, and who were more prone to endorse the SDO.

First, we aimed at determining how acculturation preferences and emotions were related to specific intergroup behavioural tendencies towards majority and minority groups. Second, we aimed at developing an intergroup behavioural tendencies scale that differentiates between valence (facilitation and harm) and intensity (active and passive). The role of intergroup contact was also examined, as it is a known predictor of intergroup prejudice. In order to fulfil these goals, we carried out two studies. In Study 1, Spanish participants ( N = 279) answered a questionnaire about Moroccans (a devalued group) or Ecuadorians (a valued group) by reporting their acculturation preferences for immigrants, their positive and negative emotions, quantity of contact with them and behavioural tendencies towards them. In Study 2, Moroccans ( N = 92) and Ecuadorians ( N = 87) assessed Spaniards on these measures. Results confirmed the structure of the new behavioural tendencies scale across four groups of participants. Overall, findings also showed that acculturation preferences and quantity of contact indirectly predicted behavioural tendencies through positive emotions. This research contributes to knowledge on how the majority and minority's acculturation preferences are related to their emotions and specific dimensions of intergroup behavioural tendencies, confirming the predominant mediating role of positive emotions in this process.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=116343960&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Although our initial hypothesized model was not confirmed, a modified model showed that the motivational factors of NCC and Decisiveness indirectly influence acculturative stress. The modified model with good fit indices indicated that the relationship between NCC and Decisiveness are mediated by coping strategies and acculturation strategies. Specifically, NCC is associated positively with avoidance coping, which in turn is negatively associated with the host group relationships and positively with the original culture maintenance. The last two dimensions predicted lower levels of acculturative stress. Decisiveness was positively associated with the problem-oriented coping and, negatively, with emotional and avoidance coping.

In linking migration to children's school trajectories, this mixed-methods study explored a range of cultural and contextual factors that contribute to Chinese children's school wellbeing in the migratory process. The key variables included acculturative attitudes, economic stress, and relationships with family, teachers and peers. The study drew upon survey data from a sample of 301 Chinese migrant students (4th-9th grade) together with in-depth interviews involving ten selected students focusing on how migrant children's school happiness and productivity are influenced by acculturation, economic hardship, and social relationships. The quantitative analysis indicated the critical role of integrative states in promoting school satisfaction and achievement. Migrant children with better social relations scored higher levels of hope, which in turn contributed to better school outcomes. Contrary to previous findings, economic stress did not hinder school outcomes for these Chinese migrant children, but appeared to act as a positive motivational factor for pursing academic success. The qualitative analysis echoed the quantitative findings, and provided further explanations for the complexity and particularity of these phenomena.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=113880872&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Several thousand Amerasians and their families left Vietnam and Cambodia for resettlement, and there are currently over thirty cluster sites of voluntary organizations used for placement and resettlement. One area is Springfield, Massachusetts, where our study is based. This research explored the mental health, adjustment, and issues of acculturation among refugees of this subgroup as they attempted to adapt to the American culture. A refugee acculturative stress inventory modified to fit this group was utilized, and Pearson correlation and t-test were employed for statistical analysis. Major findings indicate that most newly arrived Amerasians experience acculturative stress primarily in areas of spoken English, employment, and limited formal education. Gender and race had no impact on acculturative stress. Findings did not support the literature on refugees which indicates that males are more at risk than females regarding acculturative stress. There was a significant correlation between effective spoken English and employment on the level of stress.

Turks in Norway reported poorer psychological adaptation than Turks in Sweden. Predictors of good adaptation were Turkish identity and integration, whereas poor adaptation was related to marginalization and perceived discrimination. The results indicated that the poorer adaptation of Turks in Norway compared to that of Turks in Sweden could be due to lower degree of Turkish identity and higher degree of perceived discrimination.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=11999449&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

We investigated ethnic differences in allostatic load in a population-based sample of adults living in Texas City, TX, and assessed the effects of nativity and acculturation status on allostatic load among people of Mexican origin.

We also examined associations between measures of acculturation and allostatic load scores among people of Mexican origin only. Results. Foreign-born Mexicans were the least likely group to score in the higher allostatic load categories. Among individuals of Mexican origin, US-born Mexican Americans had higher allostatic load scores than foreign-born Mexicans, and acculturation measures did not account for the difference. Conclusions. Our findings expand on recent research from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey with respect to ethnicity and allostatic load.

The second part of the paper discusses conceptual and methodological issues in the assessment of acculturation. This is followed by a discussion of ways in which acculturation can be taken into account in assessing multicultural groups, such as establishing different norms for different cultural groups, adding a “correction” for acculturation status, or assessing acculturation, and using this score either as a covariate or as a threshold value that determines whether or not a score on a target instrument can be interpreted adequately.

Results . Mexican American adolescents born in the United States and those with high acculturation levels reported significantly higher prevalence rates of asthma, wheezing, and hay fever than their peers with low acculturation levels and born in Mexico. In multivariate analyses, youths with a high acculturation level had a higher risk of asthma than those with a low acculturation level independent of country of birth. Highly acculturated youths born in the US had a higher risk for wheezing compared with less acculturated US-born or Mexico-born participants after adjusting for confounding variables. In contrast, associations of asthma and wheezing with country of birth were not significant after controlling for acculturation. Conclusions . Our findings showed that both acculturation and country of birth were linked with the risk of asthma and wheezing, with acculturation having stronger effects than country of birth, among Mexican American youths. These findings may imply that factors modified by immigration and acculturation could influence the risk of asthma and wheezing.

In group comparisons, correlation analyses and regression analyses, level of schooling represented a more significant variable for RUDAS and MMSE performance than any other variable. However, the impact of schooling was considerably more pronounced on the MMSE and the test was not found to be a valid measure of general cognitive function in subjects with less than five years of schooling.

The Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the five subscales ranged from 0.80 to 0.93 and was 0.91 for the overall scale demonstrating high internal consistency. Conclusions: The findings confirm the factor structure and reliability of the MASS for assessing acculturative stress among female Asian Indian immigrants. However, scale development is an iterative process and further testing in other contexts is recommended.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=130547610&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Although the PWB scale has been widely used in both clinical and general samples with different sociodemographic characteristics, its factor structure within first-generation Korean immigrant mothers requires examination, as they often face sociocultural challenges due to immigration-related experiences (e.g., acculturation stress, being socially and culturally segregated, following heritage cultural obligations to be a ""wise mother and good wife,"" or taking less prestigious jobs) that could negatively influence their well-being. This study examined the factor structure of an 18-item version of the PWB scale in a sample of 169 first-generation Korean immigrant mothers of young children in the United States. A second-order confirmatory factor analysis did not support the original factor structure of the PWB scale. More importantly, high correlations among some of the PWB subscales suggested that the PWB factors may not be distinct from each other and the number of factors should be reduced. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted on the four highly correlated factors in subsequent analyses, and three new factors (Satisfaction with Life, Goal Orientation, and Positive Self-Perceptions) were identified. The newly derived PWB factors were negatively correlated with mothers' depressive symptoms. These findings advanced our understanding of psychological well-being in first-generation Korean immigrant mothers and highlighted the need to consider sociocultural factors in mental health research with this population.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=136237929&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

This study had two objectives: (a) to distill the markers considered important by Japanese undergraduates to accept immigrants in Japanese society and (b) to test the premises of integrated threat and social identity theories by ascertaining the effects on marker endorsement of perceived immigrant threat, contribution, relative social status, and intergroup permeability. Native‐born Japanese (the term ""native‐born Japanese"" is used throughout this article to refer to people born as Japanese citizens—differentiating them from immigrants who are Japanese citizens naturalized after birth) from 12 Japanese universities (N = 428) completed an online survey. Marker importance ratings were factor‐analyzed, and three latent dimensions were found representing sociolinguistic, ethnic, and socioeconomic markers. Multiple hierarchical regressions discerned the main effects of immigrants' perceived threat and contribution on social markers as well as their interactions with intergroup permeability and immigrant relative status. The results underscored perceived threat's consistent role in increasing marker importance and suggested divergent paths to acceptance: Immigrants perceived as ""low‐status"" were expected to conform to sociolinguistic and ethnic markers, whereas socioeconomic markers were stressed more for ""high‐status"" immigrants when perceived immigrant threat increased and intergroup boundaries were considered less permeable.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=143652726&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

MethodsWe examined the association between nativity status and social ties using data from the Chicago Community Adult Health Study's Latino subsample, which includes Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and other Latinos. First, we used ordinary least squares (OLS) regression methods to model the effect of nativity status on five outcomes: informal social integration; social network diversity; network size; instrumental support; and informational support. Using multilevel mixed-effects regression models, we estimated the association between Latino/immigrant neighborhood composition and our outcomes, and whether these relationships varied by nativity status. Lastly, we examined the relationship between social ties and immigrants' length of time in the USA. ResultsAfter controlling for individual-level characteristics, immigrant Latinos had significantly lower levels of social ties than their US-born counterparts for all the outcomes, except informational support. Latino/immigrant neighborhood composition was positively associated with being socially integrated and having larger and more diverse social networks. The associations between two of our outcomes (informal social integration and network size) and living in a neighborhood with greater concentrations of Latinos and immigrants were stronger for US-born Latinos than for immigrant Latinos. US-born Latinos maintained a significant social ties advantage over immigrants – regardless of length of time in the USA – for informal social integration, network diversity, and network size. ConclusionAt the individual level, our findings challenge the assumption that Latino immigrants would have larger networks and/or higher levels of support and social integration than their US-born counterparts. Our study underscores the importance of understanding the contexts that promote the development of social ties. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding Latino and immigrant social ties and health outcomes.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=93257881&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

The NLAAS was based on a stratified area probability sample design, and the sample came from the 50 states and Washington, DC.

Puerto Ricans had the highest prevalence (22%) of subject-reported asthma history, while Cubans had the highest prevalence (33%) of cardiovascular disease. After accounting for age, sex, household income, number of years in the US, immigrant status, and anxiety or depression, anxiety was associated with diabetes and cardiovascular disease, in the entire sample. Depression and co-occurring anxiety and depression were positively associated with having a history of asthma but not with other physical diseases, in the entire sample. Interestingly, Puerto Ricans with a depressive disorder had a lower odds of having a history of cardiovascular disease than Puerto Ricans without a depressive disorder. The relationship between chronic physical and mental illness was not confounded by immigration status or number of years in the US.<bold>Discussion: </bold>Despite previous findings that link acculturation with both chronic physical and mental illness, this study does not find that number of years in the US nor nativity explain the prevalence of psychiatric-medical comorbidities. This study demonstrates the importance of considering psychiatric and medical comorbidity among specific ethnic groups, as different patterns emerge than when using aggregate ethnic measures.

We compared relationship standards in n = 286 Chinese living in Hong Kong, China, with standards in n = 401 Chinese migrants to a Western country (Australia) by administering the Chinese‐Western Intercultural Couple Standards Scale (CWICSS). We also compared these two groups to n = 312 Westerners living in Australia. We first tested the structural invariance of the CWICSS across the three samples with a multigroup confirmatory factor analysis. There was marginal but acceptable fit of a model of two positively correlated latent factors: Couple Bond (with four indicators, such as demonstration of love and caring) and Family Responsibility (also with four indicators, such as extended family relations and preserving face). Within the limitations of the study, results suggest migration is associated predominantly with differences in women's, but not men's, relationship standards. Migrant Chinese women show alignment of Couple Bond standards with Western standards, and divergence of Family Responsibility standards from Western standards. Discussion focused on how migration and intercultural relationship experiences might differentially influence various domains of relationship standards, gender differences in migration effects on standards, and the implications for working with culturally diverse couples.

However, other characteristics of elderly immigrants, such as the healthy immigrant effect, may counteract these potential risk factors. This study examined whether depressive symptoms differed between Chinese immigrant elders and their counterparts in China and whether health conditions were similarly associated with depressive symptoms in these two samples. Methods: Depression and health information was collected from 177 Chinese immigrant elders in Boston, the US in 2000 and from 428 education and gender-matched elders in Shanghai, China in 2003. Results: Chinese immigrants had a significantly lower score on the modified Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and its subscales: somatic symptoms and depressive affect. The association remained for the subscale depressive affect in multivariate analyses. Arthritis and back or neck problems were associated with a higher level of depressive symptoms among Chinese immigrants, while problems in walking were associated with depression among their counterparts in China. Pain was an underlying contributor to the association between depression and these health problems in both the groups. Conclusions: This study suggests that Chinese immigrant elders might be more resilient than their counterparts despite many challenges they face after moving abroad. With the growing number of older Chinese immigrants in the US, a better understanding of depressive symptoms is essential to provide culturally competent services to better serve this population.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=52700214&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

However, little is known about the correlates of mental health indicators among these groups. The primary and secondary aims were to determine the association between duration of US residence and suicidality, and 12-month mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders, respectively, among racial/ethnic minority immigrants. Methods: Data were obtained from the National Survey of American Life and the National Latino and Asian American Survey. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the association between duration of US residence, and suicidality and 12-month psychopathology. Results: Among Afro-Caribbeans, there was a modest positive association between duration of US residence and 12-month psychopathology ( P = 0.016). Among Asians there was a modest positive association between duration of US residence and suicidal ideation and attempts ( P = 0.018, 0.063, respectively). Among Latinos, there was a positive association between duration of US residence, and suicidal ideation, attempts and 12-month psychopathology ( P = 0.001, 0.012, 0.002, respectively). Latinos who had been in the US for >20 years had 2.6 times greater likelihood of suicidal ideation relative to those who had been in the US for <5 years (95 % CI 1.01-6.78). Conclusions: The association between duration of US residence and suicidality and psychopathology varies across racial/ethnic minority groups.

Yet little is known about the adequacy of the social safety net in responding to farmworker needs. Using data from the 2005-2009 National Agricultural Workers Survey (N = 10,469), the current study analyzed predictors of social welfare participation among Latinos, who represent approximately 80 percent of all farmworkers. Nearly 95 percent are immigrants, although almost half of them have lived in the United States for more than 10 years. Descriptive analyses showed that, even among farmworker households whose income fell below the poverty line or that were headed by legally documented individuals, social services use was very low. Logistic regression analyses revealed that degree of social integration influenced social welfare participation, controlling for education, poverty status, family composition, and employment characteristics. Latino farmworkers who were recent immigrants (that is, in the United States for less than five years) had significantly lower odds of access to social insurance and public assistance programs relative to their U.S.-born counterparts.

In this study we tested the effects of four high-order values (openness to change, self-transcendence, conservation, and self-enhancement, devised according to Schwartz's model) on host community acculturation orientations towards immigrants (devised according the interactive acculturation model) in the public domain of employment and the private domain of endogamy/exogamy. Participants were 264 Italian University students, who completed a questionnaire containing the Portrait Values Questionnaire, a measure of personal values, and the Host Community Acculturation Scale, aimed at measuring Italian acculturation strategies towards three groups of immigrants: Immigrants (the general category), Chinese (the valued immigrant group), and Albanians (the devalued immigrant group). Results showed that personal values are related to the adoption of acculturation orientations: In particular, the values that mostly impacted on acculturation orientations were self-transcendence and conservation. Values concerning self-transcendence encourage the adoption of integrationism, integrationism-transformation, and individualism and reduce the adoption of assimilationism, segregationism, and exclusionism. Values concerning conservation encourage the adoption of assimilation, segregation and exclusion orientations and reduce the adoption of both types of integrationism and individualism. Minor effects were found regarding self-enhancement and openness to change.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=52062877&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

In this prospective cohort study, we examined the trajectory of general health during the first 4 years after new immigrants' arrival in Canada. We focused on the change in self-rated health trajectories and their gender and ethnic disparities. Methods. Data were derived from the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Canada and were collected between April 2001 and November 2005 by Statistics Canada. We used weighted samples of 3309 men and 3351 women aged between 20 and 59 years. Results. At arrival, only 3.5% of new immigrants rated their general health as poor. Significant and steady increases in poor health were revealed during the following 4 years, especially among ethnic minorities and women. Specifically, we found a higher risk of poor health among West Asian and Chinese men and among South Asian and Chinese women than among their European counterparts. Conclusions. Newly arrived immigrants are extremely healthy, but the health advantage dissipates rapidly during the initial years of settlement in Canada. Women and minority ethnic groups may be more vulnerable to social changes and postmigration settlement.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=85594157&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Design:A questionnaire consisting of the following sections was submitted to 900 workers in Southern Italy: for individual and cultural characteristics, coping strategies, personality behaviours, and acculturation strategies; for work characteristics, perceived job demands and job resources/rewards; for appraisals, perceived job stress/satisfaction and racial discrimination; for subjective reports of health, psychological disorders and general health. To test the reliability and construct validity of the extracted factors referred to all dimensions involved in the proposed model and logistic regression analyses to evaluate the main effects of the independent variables on the health outcomes were conducted. Results: Principal component analysis (PCA) yielded seven factors for individual and cultural characteristics (emotional/relational coping, objective coping, Type A behaviour, negative affectivity, social inhibition, affirmation/maintenance culture, and search identity/adoption of the host culture); three factors for work characteristics (work demands, intrinsic/extrinsic rewards, and work resources); three factors for appraisals (perceived job satisfaction, perceived job stress, perceived racial discrimination) and three factors for subjective reports of health (interpersonal disorders, anxious-depressive disorders, and general health). Logistic regression analyses showed main effects of specific individual and cultural differences, work characteristics and perceived job satisfaction/stress on the risk of suffering health problems. Conclusion:The suggested model provides a strong framework that illustrates how psychosocial and individual variables can influence occupational health in multi-cultural workplaces.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=126891343&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Most literature examines how natives distinguish between immigrants with different levels of assimilation, which is best suited to identifying integration boundaries between different types of immigrants. We shift the analysis and examine the boundary between immigrants and natives, which measures integration by the extent to which immigrant status is relevant for character evaluations. We compare how natives respond to national insults that come from immigrants as opposed to natives. We focus on insulting the nation because it highlights the salience of national identity and clarifies the importance of group boundaries. We measure responses to national insults with vignette experiments from three original surveys in the United States. Our results are consistent with situationist theories of interpersonal interactions because they suggest that character evaluations are more dependent on the situational distinction between people who do and do not insult the nation than the demographic distinction between whether the insult comes from a native or immigrant. These findings have multiple implications for our understanding of national identity, immigrant integration, and immigrant‐native boundaries.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=128731402&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

This study explored health beliefs and healthcare-seeking behaviors of older USA-dwelling Mexicans and Mexican-Americans using the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as a conceptual guide. Design. A mixed-method cross-sectional design was utilized using semi-structured interviews to obtain detailed descriptions of 31 older (50 + ) participants' behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about health and healthcare utilization. An interview schedule consisting of open-ended and demographic questions and one standardized tool, the Bidimensional Acculturation Scale (BAS) for Hispanics, was used to collect data. Results. Several themes emerged for each belief area. Behavioral belief themes reflect participants' faith in, comfort with, and knowledge of traditional methods of care (e.g., herbs, teas, and use of curanderas) as well as their faith in the effectiveness of conventional care (e.g., medicine, technology, and use of physicians). Normative belief themes indicate that participants perceive that family and community contacts support participants' use of traditional methods and that family supports use of conventional methods. Control belief themes suggest that traditional methods are accessible and affordable but that conventional methods are not. BAS scored indicated that most (90.3%) participants adhered to Hispanic culture. Two (6.5%) participants adhered to non-Hispanic culture and one (3.2%) scored as bi-cultural. Conclusions. Themes from the data suggest that beliefs about healthcare impact the types of care utilized and the ways in which they are utilized. Clinicians and researchers striving to reduce health disparities and develop more culturally competent healthcare services for ethnic minority groups should work toward a better understanding of minority groups' belief systems about healthcare and its utilization. Utilization of the TPB allows for empirical model development that can better predict healthcare utilization behavior, further augmenting efforts to provide services that will help reduce health disparities for older Mexicans and Mexican-Americans and other populations.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=55568549&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

The study sample comprised 248 Turkish migrant women (mean age: 34.38; SD: 7.6) living in London. Self-report questionnaires were used to assess empowerment, social support, acculturation attitude and psychological distress. The study hypothesized that perceived discrimination; acculturation attitudes of separation, assimilation and marginalization; and psychological distress would be negative predictors of empowerment and that social support and an integration acculturation attitude would be positive predictors of empowerment. To some extent, the study findings supported this hypothesis. Hierarchical regression analysis indicated psychological distress to be the most significant predictor of empowerment, with other significant predictors including level of education and social support. More specifically, lower levels of psychological distress and higher levels of education and social support appeared to predict greater empowerment. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that level of education and social support may function as protective factors and that psychological distress may function as a risk factor for empowerment in the migration context. The paper discusses the findings of this study in relation to the previous literature and notes their implications for future research and practice.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=60828047&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Objectives: To describe the prevalence of alcohol drinking and examine factors associated with drinking patterns among immigrant women in Taiwan. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional questionnaire survey and data were collected from June through November in 2013. Convenience samples of 757 immigrant women were recruited across Taiwan. Alcohol use patterns during the past year were divided into abstinent, low-risk drinking, and hazardous drinking based on the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test. Measures included subject characteristics, exposure to cigarettes and alcohol, acculturation level, and perceived stress. Results: The prevalence of drinking during the past year among immigrant women was 29.9% (low-risk drinking 27.6% and hazardous drinking: 2.3%). Multinomial logistic regression showed that women who were employed, who smoked, whose husbands drank, and who interacted with Taiwanese friends frequently were significantly more likely to be in the low-risk drinking group compared with the abstinent group. Women who were divorced/widowed, who had low education levels, who smoked, and whose husbands drank were significantly more likely to be in the hazardous drinking group compared with the abstinent group. Conclusions: More acculturation in immigrant women as indicated by working and frequently interacting with friends in mainstream society was related to low-risk drinking behavior; adversities as indicated by loss of marriage and low education level were related to hazardous drinking behavior.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=121703257&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

The current study explores whether differences between immigrant spouses in host language proficiency predict marital satisfaction in their first four years in the host country. Using a three-wave longitudinal study, with intervals of one to two years, we collected data from 316 married couples who immigrated from the Former Soviet Union to Germany and Israel. Language proficiency and marital satisfaction were measured via self-report questionnaires. We conducted an Actor-Partner Interdependence Model analysis to control for dyadic and time data dependencies. The results indicate that differences between spouses in their host language proficiency predict marital dissatisfaction, and that this effect is exacerbated over time. These associations held across gender and host country. The findings are discussed in light of the gap-distress model.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=118232425&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Using an experience-centred narrative approach, we analysed the stories of 24 former refugees from two African countries resettled in South Australia. Data analysis revealed altruism and helping behaviour as a prominent and recurring theme of participants' narrated lives. This meta-theme encompassed four subthemes: (a) surviving war and exile, (b) adapting to Australian society, (c) reaching back home, and (d) meaning making through religious beliefs. Helping, cooperating, and sharing were entwined with participants' coping strategies and meaning making of experience. Participants' socio-historical, cultural, and religious context influenced the interpretations of their experiences. Taken together, our findings identified a counter narrative in refugee mental health research beyond trauma and psychopathology. Specifically, we have shown that when the refugee experience is also accompanied by situational contingencies such as receiving help and being called upon to help, together with evaluations such as empathy, identification with suffering, and gratitude, people can be motivated to help others. Future research is needed to explore how altruism and helping behaviour can promote healing from trauma, alleviate distress of separation, and ameliorate acculturation stress among diverse refugee populations.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=97653619&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

DesignTwo random samples of 1250 immigrants to Spain from Colombia, Bolivia, Romania, Morocco, and Sub-Saharan Africa and 500 native Spaniards, aged between 18 and 65, were recruited for this cross-sectional study. Several hierarchical regression analyses of ethnicity and PD on subjective mental and physical health (assessed using the health-related quality of life items, HRQLSF-12) were carried out separately for men and women. ResultsMale immigrants from Colombia and Sub-Saharan Africa showed better physical health than natives, controlling for age and socioeconomic and marital status. The immigrants – except for the Colombians – had poorer mental health than natives, especially African men and Bolivian women. Socioeconomic status had no impact on these differences. Among immigrants, PD was the best predictor of physical and mental health (controlling for socio-demographic variables). African men, Bolivian women and women without legal status exhibited the poorest self-rated mental health. ConclusionClear differences in health status among natives and immigrants were recorded. The self-selection hypothesis was plausible for physical health of Colombians and Sub-Saharan African men. Acculturation stress could explain poorer mental health in immigrants compared with natives. The association between ethnicity and poor self-reported mental health appears to be partially mediated by discrimination.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=94886103&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

I use data from a 2009-2010 Internet survey into which I incorporated country-contextual characteristics. The results of multivariate analyses show that a social integration combining duration of residence abroad and local citizenship enhances religio-ethnic identification. Another measure of integration, social networks, deters group behaviors. All measures of general integration inhibit attachment to the home country, whereas religio-ethnic acculturation is largely insignificant for transnationalism. The religiosity of the new country does not influence immigrants' religio-ethnic patterns or homeland attachment. Insofar as group size is a significant determinant of particularistic behaviors, it weakens them. The more policy-based opportunities newcomers receive, the more they dissociate from group behaviors and homeland ties. Irrespective of individual and contextual factors, living in the United States encourages group affiliation more than living in Europe does. The results are discussed in reference to four working hypotheses-marginalization, integration, assimilation, and separation-and from a U.S.-European comparative perspective.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=97937301&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

With respect to settlement context, the policy of multiculturalism in Canada and of interculturalism in Quebec, provide different contexts for immigrant acculturation and wellbeing. Acculturation strategies are assessed with measures of sense of belonging to Canada and to the province of residence: Canada and Province (strong sense of belonging to both); either Canada only or province only (strong belonging to one or to the other); and neither (strong to neither). Wellbeing is assessed by scales of Life Satisfaction and Mental Health. This study examines whether these context differences may be associated with variations in the acculturation strategies and wellbeing among immigrants and later generations. Samples of adult immigrants and subsequent generations were drawn from those who live in Québec and in the rest of Canada. The distribution of the four profiles among immigrants did not differ between Québec and the rest of Canada. However, among later generations, the 'Canada only' profile is lower, while the 'province only' is higher, in Québec than in the rest of Canada. These findings suggest a drawing away from identifying with Canada, and an increase in identifying with Québec, in later generations in Québec. This pattern is consistent with the goals of the different incorporation policies in Québec and the rest of Canada. Wellbeing was generally higher in the group with high sense of belonging to both Canada and Québec, and Mental Health was higher in Québec than in the Rest of Canada in all three generations. Implications of these findings for acculturation and settlement policy are discussed.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=148805051&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

The model proposed that host country identification is primarily determined by the positivity of the immigrants' acculturation attitude towards living according to the standards and values of the host country, followed by the degree of acceptance by members of the dominant cultural group, the success immigrants experience in the new country, and the extent to which they choose to live within their ethnic environment rather than the wider society. The study included 602 adult immigrants from a number of countries (Vietnam, People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, and New Zealand), which varied in their cultural similarity to the host country, Australia. Results from a multiple regression analysis of participants' questionnaire responses revealed good support for the model. As expected, acculturation attitude towards Australia was the strongest predictor of host country identification, followed by acceptance by Australians, while extent of ethnic involvement was a significant negative predictor. The results also revealed ethnic identification as a significant positive predictor of host country identification. The importance of the relationship between acculturation attitudes and identification is discussed, together with immigrants' identification processes towards their ethnic group and the host country.

We consider immigrant/native-born differences in the likelihood of engaging in environmentally friendly behavior. With data from a survey of New York City residents, we test two hypotheses regarding environmental behavior: (1) controlling for environmental orientation, environmental knowledge, acculturation, community attachment, and economic status will reduce immigrant/native-born differences, and (2) controlling for race will increase immigrant/native-born differences. Results. Our analysis provided no support for the second hypothesis, but there were varied results for the first hypothesis depending on the type of environmental behavior considered. Conclusions. Our findings for New York City show that fears of immigrants being less likely to engage in environmentally friendly behaviors are unfounded. Of greater significance to environmental organizations is the lower level of immigrant involvement in environmentally oriented political behaviors, suggesting that continued immigration will present challenges both in making the environmental movement more ethnically diverse and in maintaining its vitality.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=6194797&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

We grouped our sample into ""visible"" immigrant women of color and ""nonvisible"" White immigrant women. As expected, visible immigrant women reported more experiences of overt discrimination and fewer experiences of ordinary privileges than did nonvisible immigrant women. The associations of belonging to a visible immigrant group with both psychiatric symptoms and satisfaction with life were each mediated through ordinary privileges and overt discrimination. The magnitude of the two indirect effects was equal for psychiatric symptoms, but for satisfaction with life, the indirect effect through ordinary privileges was stronger. After accounting for ordinary privileges and overt discrimination, the average score for satisfaction with life was higher for visible immigrant women than for nonvisible immigrant women. These findings suggest that visible immigrant women experience exclusion from ordinary privileges to a greater extent than nonvisible immigrant women and that this type of exclusion is at least as detrimental to psychological health as more overt forms of discrimination.

Immigrants who came to Israel from English-speaking countries (N = 377) were categorized into three groups based on the work–retirement continuum (that is, working, same occupation; working, changed occupation; or retired). Using a cross-sectional design, this study examined whether the link between health and acculturation varied by immigrants' location on the work–retirement continuum. Bivariate analyses revealed group differences for two acculturation components, language proficiency (p <.0001) and dual self-identity (p <.05). Multivariable analyses indicated an interaction effect between the acculturation component of realized expectations and work–retirement continuum group status on health status. As a result, good health was related to higher levels of realized expectations for the retired group; related to lower levels of realized expectations for the ""working, changed occupations"" group; and unrelated to realized expectations for the ""working, same occupation"" group. The acculturation component of realized expectations varies depending on the immigrant's location on the work–retirement continuum. Health and social welfare professionals can promote health in working or retired immigrants by providing clear and realistic information to better align with immigrants' expectations.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=141627913&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Historical observations of disadvantage in the immigrant population, when compared to the native population, had helped to shape prevailing theories on immigration and mental health. However, data emerging from new research on Mexican Americans have come to challenge the old idea that immigrants are necessarily disadvantaged. The goal of this article is to review these new studies critically, to draw conclusions concerning the relationship between immigration and psychopathology, and to offer potential explanations for the major findings. We review five recent large-scale studies that examined the prevalence of mental disorders among Mexican-born immigrants and U.S.-born Mexican Americans in the United States. Results of these studies are inconsistent with traditional tenets on the relationship among immigration, acculturation, and psychopathology. They show that Mexico-born immigrants, despite significant socioeconomic disadvantages, have better mental health profiles than do U.S.-born Mexican Americans. Possible explanations for the better mental health profile of Mexican immigrants include research artifacts such as selection bias, a protective effect of traditional family networks, and a lower set of expectations about what constitutes ""success"" in America. The elevated rates of psychopathology in U.S.-born Mexican Americans may be related to easier access to abused substances and an elevated frequency of substance abuse among the U.S.-born.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=10909763&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Several explanations have been advanced but few have been tested empirically. We use data from the Mexican Family Life Survey and the U.S. National Health Interview Survey, including longitudinal data in the former measuring socioeconomic status (SES) and health previous to emigration, to test if (1) immigrants “import” their gradients from the sending country, or if (2) they may be changing as a result of SES-graded acculturation among Mexican migrant men in two health indicators: obesity and current smoking. We find evidence consistent with the first hypothesis: the gradients of migrants measured prior to coming to the U.S. are not statistically different from those of nonmigrants, as the gradients of each are relatively weak. Although the gradients for obesity and smoking appear to weaken with time spent in the U.S., the differences are not significant, suggesting little support for the selective acculturation hypothesis.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=82198925&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Further, the influence of immigrant status, Anglo orientation, Latino orientation, and the interaction of immigrant status and acculturation variables on IPV were examined. Data came from the Sexual Assault Among Latinas (SALAS) study that gathered data from a national sample of Latino women ( N = 2,000) via telephone interviews. Results showed 15.6 % of Latino women experienced IPV in their lifetime and threat IPV was the most common form of IPV. Physical, sexual, stalking and threat IPV were all used as abusive tactics in various configurations. Logistic regression analyses showed immigrants were less likely than U.S. born Latino women to experience any IPV and physical IPV. Anglo orientation was associated with increased odds of any IPV and stalking IPV while Latino orientation was associated with decreased odds of all forms of IPV. Furthermore, the protective effect of Latino orientation for stalking IPV was pronounced among immigrants. Together the results show that 1 in 6 Latino women experience IPV and that sociocultural factors such as immigrant status and acculturation are important considerations for this group, underscoring the influence of migration and cultural adaptation to family functioning.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=100439512&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

The current study aims to assess alcohol consumption among FSU and resident Israelis five years later to determine whether the discrepancy in alcohol consumption stays consistent or reduces. In addition, gender differences in alcohol consumption among the Israeli society were examined as well, as a special case of socio-culture differences. The data came from the 2000 national survey of drinking in Israel. Of 5,004 Jewish Israelis, 532 were immigrants from the FSU who arrived since 1989, and 4,472 were resident Israelis. The FSU group was compared with resident Israelis, and males were compared to females on several drinking variables. Logistic regression was the principal method of analysis. Demographics and cultural variables as main effects or in interaction with FSU and gender were controlled. The FSU group was significantly more likely to report drinking in the last twelve months plus drinking in the last thirty days than resident Israelis. Women's reported drinking in the last twelve months was one fourth of men's and during the past thirty days was one fifth of men's. Further investigation on the associations between the success of FSU acculturation in the Israeli society and drinking patterns as well as attitudes toward women and gender differences in alcohol consumption may provide explanations for gender and immigration gaps in alcohol consumption.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=17485201&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Acculturation, known to affect other health behaviors, may explain low physical activity (PA) among these underserved women. Research on the effects of acculturation on PA, however, is scarce or limited by methodology. The study purpose was to evaluate the association between acculturation (i.e., language, birth country, and duration of U.S. residency) and PA in a national sample of women within the framework of the socioecologic model of health promotion. Methods: A total of 5,861 women (86% white, mean age 37.2) were sampled from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). Results: Hierarchical multivariable regression modeling results indicate significant associations among language, duration of U.S. residency, and age, after controlling for confounders (all p<0.05). Most women reported less than recommended PA. Conclusions: These findings indicate that age, duration of U.S. residency, and language are important to consider in combination when understanding women's PA, findings that have implications for future research, theory, and clinical practice (e.g., making available PA assessments in multiple languages additionally tailored on age and investigating sociopolitical factors unique to Latinas).","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=83230050&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Majority's perceived contact willingness was associated with lower levels of perceived realistic threats, and perceived contact willingness and perceived socio-cultural adaptation were both associated with lower levels of perceived symbolic threats.

Method:Participants were 128 older (50–80 years) Somali refugees living in Finland. They reported experiences of war trauma and childhood adversities, and filled-in questionnaires of perceived ethnic discrimination, religiousness (beliefs, attendance, and observance of Islamic faith), and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depressive (BDI-21), psychological distress (GHQ-12), and somatization (SCL-90).

Research on migrant health mostly examines labor migrants, with some attention paid to the trauma faced by refugees. Marriage migrants represent an understudied vulnerable population in the migration and health literature. Objectives. Drawing on a Social Determinants of Health (SDH) approach, we use a large Korean national survey and stratified multivariate regressions to examine the link between migration processes and the self-rated health of Korea's three largest ethnic groups of marriage migrants: Korean-Chinese, Vietnamese, and Han Chinese. Results. We find that post-migration socioeconomic status and several social integration factors are associated with the health of marriage migrants of all three groups. Specifically, having more social relationships with Koreans is associated with good health among marriage migrants, while having more social relationships with co-ethnics is associated with worse health. Marriage migrants' perceived social status of their natal and marital families is a better predictor of their health than more objective measures such as their education attainment and that of their Korean husbands. The post-migration social gradients among all ethnic groups demonstrate a dose-response effect of marital family's social standing on marriage migrants' health, independent of their own education and the social standing of their natal families. Lastly, we find some ethnicity-specific predictors such as the association between higher educational level and worse health status among the Vietnamese. This variability by group suggests a more complex set of SDH occurred during the marriage migration processes than a basic SDH framework would predict. Conclusion. Using a new immigrant destination, South Korea, as an example, we conclude that migration and health policies that reduce ethnicity-specific barriers and offer integration programs in early post-migration stages may offer a pathway to good health among marriage migrants.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=110813337&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Multiculturalism was measured with an adaptation of the Multicultural Ideology Scale (Berry & Kalin, 1995); acculturation orientation was investigated in different domains of life. The results revealed that Dutch on average had a neutral attitude towards multiculturalism in the Netherlands while Turkish–Dutch showed a more positive attitude. Regarding the acculturation strategies, Dutch adults preferred assimilation above integration of Turkish migrants in all life domains. Turkish–Dutch adults made a distinction in public and private domains: integration was preferred in public domains, and separation in private domains. In public domains both cultural groups agreed that Turkish migrants should adapt to the Dutch culture. In private domains there was no agreement at all in the views of Dutch and Turkish–Dutch. These results suggest that the views on acculturation and multiculturalism differ substantially for majority and minority group members. Implications are discussed.

In line with previous work, we found among Romanians and Moroccan immigrants in France that perceived French rejection directly affected French identification and acculturation orientations. In addition, perceived rejection by the country of origin (Romanians and Moroccans in the country of origin) negatively affected immigrants' identification with this group. In turn, identification with the country of origin positively predicted endorsement of integration and separation orientations, and negatively predicted endorsement of assimilation.

We examined obesogenic dietary practices among Latino and Asian subgroups of children living in California. Methods. We analyzed 2007, 2009, and 2011-2012 California Health Interview Survey data to examine the differences in dietary practices among Mexican and non-Mexican Latino children and 7 ethnic subgroups of Asian children. We used multivariable regression to examine the sociodemographic factors associated with specific dietary practices. Results. Latino subgroups of children had few differences in obesogenic dietary practices, whereas Asian subgroups of children exhibited significant differences in several obesogenic dietary practices. Korean and Filipino children were more likely than Chinese children to consume fast food and have low vegetable intake. Filipino children, followed by Japanese children, had the most obesogenic dietary practices compared with Chinese children, who along with South Asian children appeared to have the least obesogenic dietary practices. In general, income, education, and acculturation did not explain the dietary differences among Asian groups. Conclusions. Our findings suggest the need to disaggregate dietary profiles of Asian and Latino children and to consider nontraditional sociodemographic factors for messaging and counseling on healthy dietary practices among Asian populations.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=108279158&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

This study assessed the relation of perceived discrimination with depressive symptoms and drug use. Covariates included immigrant generation status (GS). A second objective was to examine the potentially moderating effect of neighborhoods' ethnic composition as suggested by Mair et al. Design: Secondary data analyses of a longitudinal survey examined self-reports of Hispanic adolescents in 9th grade (the first year of high school) and 11th grade at seven high schools in Los Angeles. Results: (1) Perceiving discrimination in 9th grade significantly predicted depressive symptoms (β=0.23, p<0.01) and drug use (β=0.12, p<0.01) in 11th grade, even after controlling for socioeconomic status, gender, acculturation, and GS in the USA. The third GS group reported significantly higher perceptions of discrimination compared to newer immigrants. (2) Neighborhoods' ethnic composition was included as a moderator of the association between perceived discrimination and the outcomes, but did not moderate the relation. Conclusion: Teaching Hispanic adolescents effective strategies for coping with discrimination, such as increasing their sense of belongingness in the American mainstream, may prove useful in preventing drug use and depressive symptoms.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=88089520&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Method: Personal interviews were held with 3906 veteran Israelis, 845 immigrants from the former Soviet Union (FSU) and 107 immigrants from other countries (all the immigrants immigrated after 1989). Psychological distress was measured on the General Health Questionnaire-12. Results: Psychological distress among FSU immigrants was significantly higher than among veteran Israelis and immigrants from elsewhere. FSU immigrants were almost twice as likely to report severe psychological distress. Factors associated with psychological distress were female gender, age above 50, being divorced/widowed, being secular, having higher education and being either unemployed or 'not in workforce'. Conclusion: The results support the acculturation stress hypothesis as an explanation for psychological distress in immigrants only in immigrants from the FSU, indicating that policymakers should plan services and prevention programmes differentially for different immigrant populations.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=35730035&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

"Psychological, sociocultural, and marital adaptation of Turkish immigrant couples in Canada.","Ataca, Bilge; Berry, John W.","International Journal of Psychology",="00207594",,="Feb2002","37","1","13","14","6120211","10.1080/00207590143000135","Wiley-Blackwell","Article","ONTARIO; TORONTO (Ont.); CANADA; ADAPTABILITY (Psychology); MARRIED people -- Psychology",,"The study examined the acculturation and adaptation of 200 married Turkish immigrants in Toronto, Canada, using selfreport questionnaires. As an extension of research from sojourners to immigrants, and from individuals to married couples, marital adaptation was introduced and three facets of adaptation were differentiated: psychological, sociocultural, and marital. The findings support the contention that adaptation is multifaceted. Consistent with stress and coping models, psychological adaptation of married couples was associated with the personality variable of hardiness, social support, acculturation attitudes, and discrimination. On the other hand, in line with social learning perspectives, sociocultural adaptation was mostly related to the variables instrumental in acquiring social skills in the new culture, namely, language proficiency and contact with members of the dominant group. Marital adaptation was mostly associated with marital stressors and marital support. The lack of research on gender differences in the differentiation of adaptation was addressed. This differentiation was clearer in men than in women; there were also different variables associated with the facets of men's and women's adaptation. The effects of socioeconomic status and gender have also been examined. The findings made it evident that Turkish immigrants did not acculturate uniformly. Two groups of Turkish immigrants, working class and professionals were clearly distinguished in their acculturation experiences and adaptation. Gender differences were most apparent in the low socioeconomic status group. Women in general were psychologically more vulnerable than men; the group that faced more risk factors were those women of low socioeconomic status. In terms of acculturation attitudes, Turkish immigrant couples strongly endorsed separation; however, those of high socioeconomic status preferred integration and assimilation to a greater, and separation to a lesser extent than those of low socioeconomic status. L'étude a examiné l'acculturation et l'adaptation de 200 immigrants turcs mariés à Toronto, Canada, utilisant des questionnaires d'auto rapport. En amplifiant la recherche des résidents temporels aux immigrants et des célibataires aux couples mariés on a introduit l'adaptation et trois facettes ont été différenciées: psychologique, socioculturelle et maritale. Les résultats confirment l'affirmation que l'adaptation comporte de multiples facettes. L'adaptation psychologique des couples mariés qui est conforme aux modèles de stress et d'affrontement a été associé à la variable de personnalité audace, à l'appui social, aux attitudes relatives à l'acculturation et à la discrimination. Par ailleurs, en parallèle aux perspectives de l'apprentissage social, l'adaptation socioculturelle a été associéeen grande partie aux variables instrumentales servant à acquérir des habilités sociales dans la nouvelle culture, notamment la maîtrise de la langue et le contact avec des membres du groupe dominant. L'adaptation maritale a été associée principalement à des éléments de stress et de support dans le couple. Etant donné le manque de différentiation relative au sexe dans la recherche de l'adaptation, cet aspect a été traité. Cette différentiation s'est avérée plus claire chez les hommes que chez les femmes,il y a eu également des variables différentes associées aux facettes d'adaptation des hommes et des femmes. L'influence du statut socio-économique et du sexe a été également examinée. Les résultats ont mis en évidence le fait que les immigrants turcs ne subissent pas l'acculturation d'une manière uniforme. Deux groupes d'immigrants turcs, des ouvriers et des employés, ont été clairement distingués au point de vue de leur expérience d'acculturation et leur adaptation. Des différences relatives au sexe ont été plus marquées dans le groupe avec le statut social inférieur. Les femmes en général étaient plus vulnérables que les hommes, le groupe qui affrontait le plus de facteurs de risque était celui des femmes de statut socio-économique inférieur. Concernant les attitudes relatives à l'acculturation, les couples d'immigrants turcs ont opté fortement pour une distanciation, cependant les couplesavec un statut socio-économique élevé ont préféré l'intégration et l'assimilation et, dans une moindre mesure, la séparation que ceux avec un statut socio-économique inférieur. El estudio examinó la aculturación y adaptación de 200 turcos casados inmigrados a Toronto, Canadá, por medio del uso de cuestionarios de auto informe. De la extensión de la investigación sobre residentes temporales a los inmigrantes, y de los individuos a las parejas de cónyuges, se introdujo la adaptación conyugal y se diferenciaron tres facetas de adaptación: psicológica, sociocultural y marital. Los hallazgos apoyan la aseveración de que la adaptación es multifacética. Consistente con los modelos de estrés y afrontamiento, la adaptación psicológica de las parejas de casados se asoció con la variable de personalidad audacia, con el apoyo social, las actitudes relativas a la aculturación, y la discriminación. Por otra parte, de acuerdo con la perspectiva del aprendizaje social, la adaptación sociocultural se relacionó principalmente con las variables instrumentales para la adquisición de habilidades sociales en la nueva cultura, propiamente, dominio del lenguaje y contacto con los miembros del grupo dominante. La adaptación marital se asoció en mayor medida con los estresores conyugales y el apoyo de la pareja. Considerando la carencia de investigación sobre diferencias de género en cuanto a la adaptación, se trató este aspecto. Esta diferenciación se dio con mayor claridad en los hombres que en las mujeres; hubo también diferentes variables asociadas con las facetas de adaptación de hombres y de mujeres. También se examinaron los efectos del nivel socioeconómico y el sexo. Los hallazgos evidenciaron que los inmigrantes turcos no logran la aculturación de una manera uniforme. Dos grupos de inmigrantes turcos, de clase trabajadora y profesionales, se distinguieron entre sí respecto a sus experiencias de aculturación y su adaptación. Las diferencias entre sexos fueron más ostensibles en el grupo de bajo nivel socioeconómico. Las mujeres, en general, resultaron psicológicamente más vulnerables que los hombres; el grupo que encaró más factores de riesgo fue el de las mujeres de bajo nivel socioeconómico. En términos de las actitudes relativas a la aculturación, las parejas turcas inmigrantes abogaron con fuerza por la separación, sin embargo, aquéllos de nivel socioeconómico alto prefirieron la integración y la asimilación y, en menor medida, la separación que aquéllos de bajo nivel socioeconómico.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=6120211&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Design: Data are from a cross-sectional survey of 244 women of Chinese ethnicity living in Seattle, WA, USA and Vancouver, BC, Canada. Using an interviewer-administered questionnaire and PRECEDE/PROCEED as our model, we collected information on diet-related psychosocial (predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing) factors; consumption of foods reflecting Western and Chinese dietary practices; and past and current consumption of fruits, vegetables and fat. Results: Participants generally believed that there were strong relationships between diet and health, but only about a quarter were aware of nutrition information from the government. Food cost, availability, and convenience did not appear to be major concerns among these participants. Respondents' older relatives and spouses tended to prefer a Chinese diet and also had a strong influence on the household diet. Associations of the psychosocial factors with demographic characteristics, adoption of Western dietary practices, and consumption of fruits and vegetables were informative. For example, older, less educated respondents considered it very important to eat a low fat, high fruit and vegetable diet; while younger, more educated participants who were employed outside the home did not think the Chinese diet is healthier than a typical Western diet (all p < 0.05). Western acculturated respondents were more likely to believe in a relationship between diet and cancer/heart disease and report that preparing Chinese meals is inconvenient (p < 0.05). Respondents with in-family normative pressure to maintain Chinese eating patterns ate more fruits and vegetables (4.4 vs 3.7 servings), while knowledge of nutrition information from the government was associated with increased fruit and vegetable consumption after immigration (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: Chinese cultural beliefs play an important role in the dietary practices of Chinese living in North America. Therefore, traditional health beliefs, as well as socioeconomic and environmental factors related to diet should be incorporated into the design and implementation of culturally appropriate health promotion programs for Chinese immigrants.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=6895251&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

First, should immigration policy measures be more restrictive toward overseas labor migrants? Secondly, should overseas labor migrants be replaced with Palestinian workers? Based on an attitudinal survey administered to a representative sample of the Israeli population, the findings indicate that support for a restrictive immigration policy is quite prevalent among Israelis. However, the survey reveals only moderate consent for replacing overseas labor migrants with Palestinian commuters. Attitudes toward a restrictive immigration policy are explained by the perceived threat posed by overseas labor migrants to social and economic interests. This threat is explained by the respondents’ socio-economic characteristics. Attitudes toward the replacement policy are partially explained by the sense of threat to the Jewish character of the state posed by overseas migrants, but are also attributed to several personal characteristics. Policy implications of these findings are discussed.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=111498813&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Previous research has confirmed the link between right‐wing authoritarianism and majority members' acculturation preferences. Nonetheless, a test of their longitudinal relationship was still lacking. Using data from a 3‐wave panel study in Germany, we demonstrate that right‐wing authoritarianism among majority members predicts less support for immigrants' cultural maintenance and less support for the establishment of intergroup relations over time (Study 1, N = 551). Using cross‐sectional survey data, we show that collective threat mediates these relationships (Study 2, N = 817). Data were representative of the German adult population. Our findings indicate that authoritarian majority members oppose integration because they perceive foreigners as threatening. Right‐wing authoritarianism appears to be a meaningful individual difference variable linked to majority members' attitudes towards immigrants' maintenance of their heritage culture and the establishment of intergroup relations over time. Our findings complement recent theorizing about acculturation processes.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=143570271&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

The questionnaire included scales for assessing acculturation attitudes (integration, assimilation, and separation), individual social capital (bridging and bonding), and sociocultural adaptation. Using parallel mediation analysis, we found that acculturation attitudes for migrants from Central Asia are secondary to their social capital in relation to sociocultural adaptation. However, among migrants from South Korea, social capital is not linked to their acculturation attitudes, and in general, its role in sociocultural adaptation is lower as compared to the role of acculturation attitudes. As a whole, our research shows that although sociocultural adaptation for all ethnic groups is linked to acculturation attitudes and social capital, acculturation attitudes for certain ethnic groups can be dependent on social capital.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=144882879&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

The first is Immersion within the Society of Origin (ISO), which has two facets: ""Orientation towards Members of the Ingroup"" (OMI) and ""Orientation towards the culture of origin"" (OCO). The second, ""Immersion within the Host Society"" (IHS) also comprises two facets: ""Orientation towards People of French Origin"" (OPFO) and ""Orientation towards French Culture"" (OFC). The aim was to analyse the relationship between these four facets of sociocultural acculturative orientations and various socio-demographic and psychosocial variables. Two-hundred-and-ten North African immigrants in France answered a questionnaire adapted from Stephenson's Multigroup Acculturation Scale (SMAS). Stepwise multiple regression analyses show that OMI is linked to the country of origin and cultural identity, and OCO to satisfaction with life, family situation, sex and cultural identity. OPFO is linked to participation in club activities, and OFC to work/student activity and family situation. These results illustrate the relevance and value of studying immigrants' sociocultural, acculturative orientation on the basis of ISO vs. IHS models, and in the fields of their social relations and their relationship with the culture. They highlight the importance of looking at acculturation as a composite process, the various facets of which are related to different variables that can therefore be regarded as relevant indicators of immigrants' intercultural adaptation.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=36670219&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

But scales based on the quantification of subjective traits ('rate your feelings on a scale of 1 to 5') and initially developed in western population samples may not be valid for use in minority ethnic groups, even if accurately translated. The measurement of cultural adaptation and assimilation in immigrant groups is important for health research but has well documented methodological challenges. The aim of this study was to develop valid and reliable questionnaires to measure subjective health status and cultural adherence in a minority ethnic group, using the story as the unit of inquiry. The design was a multi-phase study involving (a) narrative interview, (b) vignette construction, (c) questionnaire development, and (d) questionnaire validation in relation to two scales (well-being and cultural adherence) in British Bangladeshis with diabetes. Using data from in-depth narrative interviews (i.e., a non-directive research technique in which the participant is invited to 'tell me the story about your diabetes, starting with when you first noticed anything wrong', and the only prompts used are 'tell me more about that' or 'what happened next?'; Greenhalgh, Helman, & Chowdhury, 1998; Muller, 1999), we constructed culturally congruent vignettes to depict different subjective health states and behaviours. We refined these items in focus group interviews and validated the instruments on 98 Bangladeshi participants, randomly sampled from GP diabetes registers in inner London and interviewed by a Bangladeshi anthropologist. We used factor analysis to explore the underlying structure in the responses to questionnaire items, plus Cronbach alpha tests to measure internal consistency of scales. The questionnaires were acceptable and credible to Bangladeshi participants with diabetes. Ninety of 98 participants were able and willing to complete them with interviewer assistance. Following factor analysis, we produced two definitive instruments. The well-being scale was a single-factor model with four story-based items (measuring depression, anxiety, physical energy, and social activities), with a Cronbach's alpha of .92. The cultural adherence scale was a single-factor model with five items (measuring religious restrictions, ethnic practices, and social ties), with a Cronbach's alpha of .83. In conclusion, this study has produced two important outputs: (a) easy-to-administer, story-based questionnaires that measure well-being and cultural adherence, which are specific to British Bangladeshis with diabetes; (b) a general method for developing story-based instruments to quantify the subjective experience of illness and adherence to cultural norms, which potentially has applications beyond the study population.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=106288054&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Using a cross-sectional study design, a convenience sample of English-speaking participants was recruited through a link on a well-known English-language internet site targeting immigrants to Israel. Due to the diversity of respondents, only questionnaires completed by immigrants from the following four countries were included (n = 641): Canada (n = 40), South Africa (n = 66), the United Kingdom (n = 132) and the United States (n = 403). Life satisfaction only was linked to the acculturation variable of having a higher level of realised expectations for life after immigration and reporting good health, but not associated with the other acculturation variables of language acquisition or self-identification with host country. While having realised expectations was related to life satisfaction, the number of years in the host country and language acquisition was not. Having realistic expectations (related to greater life satisfaction) may be increased by providing prospective immigrants information on the new country's culture while they are still in the host country and planning their immigration.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=142867558&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

The objectives of this paper are to examine the associations between immigrant generational status (IGS), child maltreatment (CM), intimate partner violence (IPV) and acculturation (i.e., the extent to which an individual adopts the values, language and attitudes of a new culture). Methods: The sample was drawn from wave two of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC; n = 34,653), a nationally representative survey of United States (US) residents aged 20 years and older. Logistic regression was used to estimate the associations between IGS, CM history, IPV, and acculturation. Results: Compared to 3rd generation (or later) respondents, 1st generation immigrants were less likely to report a history of sexual (AOR = 0.74, CI = 0.62, 0.90) and emotional abuse (AOR = 0.69, CI = 0.55, 0.87), but were more likely to report physical neglect (AOR = 1.30, CI = 1.11, 1.52). After adjusting for covariates, IGS was not associated with IPV among respondents with or without a CM history. Among those without a CM history, highly acculturated 1st generation immigrants (AOR = 1.07, CI = 1.01, 1.13) were more likely to report perpetrating IPV, with highly acculturated 3rd generation respondents having lower odds of reporting IPV perpetration (AOR = 0.93, CI = 0.88-1.00). Conclusion: IGS and acculturation are important factors in CM and IPV. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the influence of IGS, recency of immigration, acculturation and acculturative stress on the experiences and relationship between CM and IPV.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=103187638&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

In addition to demographic information, measures of acculturation, spirituality, social support, and perceived social status were administered to 336 participants. Latter-day Saints compared with Catholics and those of other religious affiliation tended to score significantly higher on Anglo cultural orientation, spirituality, and social support. Latter-day Saint acculturation may have been partly due to greater interaction with the US culture prior to coming to this country. Latter-day Saints also rated their subjective social status higher. Overall, religious affiliation was the strongest predictor of Anglo cultural orientation except for age upon entering the United States. In conclusion, religious affiliation predicts level of acculturation. Membership in an organisation that is dominant in the local community (e.g., the Latter-day Saint Church) contributes to the acculturation process, higher levels of spiritual well-being, and social support.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=62667676&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Female Chinese rural-to-urban migrants may experience greater depression following exposure to IPV due to lack of social support and integration within their receiving communities. The current study estimated the prevalence of IPV among rural-to-urban migrants in Guangzhou, China, and evaluated the moderating effects of social resources on migrant's depression symptoms. METHOD: We recruited 1,368 women (1,003 migrants and 365 local-born) of childbearing age from population and family planning centers in two districts using a quota sampling method matched to the 2012 population census. Chinese versions of the Conflict Tactics Scale 2 Short Form, Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale and the Social Support Rating Scale measured IPV, depression, and social support. Social integration was measured with a locally derived scale. RESULTS: Migrants reported a similar prevalence for IPV (41.20%) to local women (39.20%). Bivariate comparisons demonstrated that migrants reported greater depression (11.8±8.9 vs. 10.0±8.8, t=-3.27, p<0.001) and less social support (22.2±5.1 vs. 27.1±5.5, t=14.84, p<0.001). Regression analysis indicated that the effect of violence on depression symptoms for migrant women was moderated by social integration. Women who experienced violence and had greater integration in their community reported less depression than women who experienced violence but reported less social integration. CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of IPV was reported in our sample. Social integration is a key risk factor for migrant mental health. Social services aimed to reduce IPV and integrate migrants in their new communities are needed.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=110338568&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

How do individuals of Asian descent in the United States identify themselves in ethnic terms and why? The purpose of this research is to map the contours of ethnic self-identities among Asian adults and explain their identity preferences in this immigrant community of color. Methods. We analyze a new and large-scale survey that collected public opinion from randomly selected individuals of the six largest Asian American descents who resided in five major metropolitan areas in 2000–2001. Results. We find that two-thirds of the respondents prefer to identify themselves in ethnic-specific modes. Although only one in six respondents preferred to identify themselves as “Asian American,” close to six in ten respondents indicated acceptance to this panethnic term as part of their identification. Using multinomial regression analysis, we show that indicators of primordial ties and prior socialization, in addition to cultural, social, and political integration, are instrumental in structuring ethnic identity preferences among Asian Americans. Conclusions. Our results confirm ethnic identity as a fluid, malleable, and layered phenomenon that depends on context. Our findings also highlight the need for reconsideration and expansion of the extant conceptual frameworks on studying ethnic identity formation for a nonwhite, multiethnic, multilingual, and globally connected population.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=9841169&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

In non-Western countries, however, the social gradient is not always evident, with some countries appearing to show a reversed social gradient. It was hypothesized that culture moderates the social gradient, with the relationship between SES and BP differing as a function of culture. To investigate the idea of a “cultural gradient” a sample of Hispanic immigrants and Whites was studied. A total of 79 participants (30 Hispanic immigrant, 49 White) wore ambulatory blood pressure monitors for 24 h. The Hispanic immigrants also completed the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans- II. Hispanic immigrants had lower SES and lower BP compared to Whites. A cultural gradient moderating the social gradient was evident with Hispanic immigrants displaying a positive relationship between SES and BP and Whites displaying a negative relationship. Among Hispanic immigrants, increased acculturation to Western culture decreased the positive relationship between SES and BP. Just as there is a social gradient with increasing socioeconomic status related to better cardiovascular health, there appears to be a cultural gradient with increasing acculturation to Western society related to worse cardiovascular health.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=23196193&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Questionnaire data were collected twice from 137 immigrant students, first at the upstart in junior high school, and then again a year later (8th and 9th grade). Acculturation was described in positive terms as a developmental process towards gaining competence within more than one sociocultural setting. Perceived discrimination and ethnic identity crisis were included as risk factors in this process. A model of structural relations was tested, which after some modifications demonstrated a close fit to the data. The results supported our suggestions of two indirect paths of effects of acculturation on mental health change: one through culture domain-specific social support and another through self-esteem. Self-esteem was also identified as a mediator of identity crisis. Significant interaction effects between social support and culture competencies were demonstrated in addition to buffer effects of class and family support in relation to identity crisis and discrimination respectively. The study adds to our understanding of positive and negative developmental pathways in multicultural societies.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=15060009&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Methods: Israeli women aged 45–64 were randomly selected according to age and population strata of three groups: long-term Jewish residents (LTR), Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union, and Arab women (mostly Israeli-born). Interviews were conducted with 540 LTR, 151 immigrants, and 123 Arab women. The survey instrument included the occurrence and rating of how bothersome to everyday function were 16 symptoms. Three outcome variables included hot flashes and two scales for mental and somatic symptoms extracted from exploratory factor analysis. Results: Multivariate logistic regressions showed that immigrants and Arab women (compared to LTR) had a significantly lower risk of reporting hot flashes and mental and somatic symptoms. Menopausal status was related only to hot flashes. Low education and depression were associated with the three symptom scales, whereas nonhealthy lifestyle was related only to somatic symptoms. Conclusions: Our main finding is that cultural group is an independent predictor of each of the three menopausal symptom scales. A possible explanation for the lower reporting of symptoms among Arab and immigrant groups is that they differ from the LTR in level of acculturation and attitudes toward menopause. These findings support the proposition of a cultural factor in menopausal symptomatology that needs to be addressed by clinicians caring for women at midlife.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=50355627&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

We assessed the impact of health literacy and acculturation on oral health status of Somali refugees in Massachusetts. Methods. Between December 2009 and June 2011, we surveyed 439 adult Somalis who had lived in the United States 10 years or less. Assessments included oral examinations with decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) counts and measurement of spoken English and health literacy. We tested associations with generalized linear regression models. Results. Participants had means of 1.4 decayed, 2.8 missing, and 1.3 filled teeth. Among participants who had been in the United States 0 to 4 years, lower health literacy scores correlated with lower DMFT (rate ratio [RR] = 0.78; P = .016). Among participants who had been in the country 5 to 10 years, lower literacy scores correlated with higher DMFT (RR = 1.37; P = .012). Literacy was not significantly associated with decayed teeth. Lower literacy scores correlated marginally with lower risk of periodontal disease (odds ratio = 0.22; P = .047). Conclusions. Worsening oral health of Somali refugees over time may be linked to less access to preventive care and less utilization of beneficial oral hygiene practices.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=88957012&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Increasing global migration has led to profound demographic changes in most industrialised countries. A growing body of research has investigated various health aspects among immigrant groups and found that some immigrant groups have poorer health than the majority population. It has been suggested that poor acculturation in the host country could lie behind the increased risk of worsened health among certain immigrant groups. The aim was to investigate the cross-sectional association between acculturation, measured as age at migration or length of residence, and self-rated health among young immigrants. Design. The simple, random samples of 7137 women and 7415 men aged 16-34 years were based on pooled, independent data collected during the period 1992-1999 obtained from the Swedish Annual Level of Living Survey (SALLS). Logistic regression was applied in the estimation of odds ratios (OR) for poor self-rated health, after accounting for age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES) and social networks. The non-response rate varied between 23.6 and 28.3% in the different immigrant groups. Results. The odds of poor self-rated health increased with increasing age at migration to Sweden among first-generation immigrants. For those who had resided in Sweden less than 15 years the odds of poor self-rated health were significantly increased. In addition, most of the immigrant groups had higher odds of poor self-rated health than the reference group. Conclusions. Health care workers and policy makers need to be aware that immigrants who arrive in the host country at higher ages and/or have lived in the host country for a shorter period of time might need special attention as they are more likely to suffer from poor self-rated health, a valid health status indicator that can be used in population health monitoring.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=36114477&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

A sample of 1146 immigrants, aged between 20 and 36 and representing seven immigrant groups (Russians, Ingrian/Finnish returnees, Estonians, Somalis, Arabs, Vietnamese and Turks), answered a mailed questionnaire based on traditional acculturation research as well as victim research. In accordance with our expectations, discrimination experiences in various realms of life were highly predictive of the psychological well-being of all immigrants, as well as of lack of trust in the Finnish authorities. However, contrary to our hypotheses regarding the effects of visibility and cultural proximity, group differences in psychological distress did not correspond to the group differences observed in perceived discrimination. These results are discussed in the light of the opposing predictions concerning self-damage effects of discrimination, made by social identity theory on the one hand and the theory on self-protecting functions of external attributions (Crocker and Major, 1989) on the other. It is concluded that the low level of stress observed in the most visible and most culturally distant group, despite high levels of perceived discrimination, is better explained by the latter than the former.

We examined whether immigration-related characteristics and perceptions of risk surrounding substance use were independently associated with lifetime use of cigarettes and various illicit substances among immigrant and native-born Latino and non-Latino White adults in the United States. Methods. Data were from the 2002 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Analyses were limited to Latinos and non-Latino Whites 18 years and older. We used cross-tabulations and multivariate logistic regression to test relations between risk perceptions, immigration characteristics, and substance use. Results. More than two thirds of all respondents perceived moderate or great risk to health and well-being associated with all substances analyzed. The odds of lifetime substance use by Latino and non-Latino White immigrants were lower than for US-born non-Latino Whites. Immigrant Latinos' odds of lifetime substance use were lower than for US-born Latinos. Moderate or great perceived risk was associated with lower likelihood of lifetime use of all substances except cigarettes. Conclusions. Foreign birth appeared to protect against substance use among both Latino and non-Latino White immigrants.

We examined whether the interactions between primarily speaking English at home and community-level measures (median household income and immigrant composition) are associated with physical inactivity and obesity. Methods. We pooled the 2005 and 2007 Los Angeles County Health Survey data to construct a multilevel data set, with community-level median household income and immigrant density as predictors at the community level. After controlling for individual-level demographic variables, we included the respondent's perceived community safety as a covariate to test the hypothesis that perceived public safety mediates the association between acculturation and health outcomes.

The interaction between community median household income and primarily speaking English at home was associated with lower likelihoods of physical inactivity (odds ratio [OR] = 0.644; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.502, 0.825) and obesity (OR = 0.674; 95% CI = 0.514, 0.882).

Resources in higher-income areas may be beneficial only to residents fully integrated into the community. Future research could focus on understanding how linguistic isolation affects community-level social learning and access to resources and whether this differs by family-level acculturation.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=103318278&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

In the meantime high rates of immigration have produced an increasingly culturally diverse population. A “people of color” hypothesis suggests that the color line the new immigrants face resembles that imposed on African Americans. A “black exceptionalism” hypothesis suggests instead that the color line will be more porous for them, allowing for greater assimilation over successive generations, including a gradual weakening of politicized racial and ethnic group consciousness. Using data from Los Angeles County Social Surveys, we find that the largest new immigrant group, Latinos, like blacks, show strongly group-interested policy preferences and strong group consciousness. However, both effects are stronger for recent Latino immigrants than for the U.S.-born. We conclude that the new immigrant groups are increasingly likely to assimilate politically into the broader society in future generations, whereas a rather strict color line will continue to restrict blacks and maintain their distinctiveness.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=23115490&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Data were obtained from the 2009 California Health Interview Survey and included Asian (n = 1264) and Hispanic (n = 571) adults aged 60 and older who were born outside of the US. Outcome variables included presence of past year alcohol consumption, past year binge drinking, and number of binge drinking days. Acculturation was measured with items pertaining to English use and proficiency. Hierarchical multiple or logistic regression analyses were conducted separately for each racial/ethnic group and each dependent variable. Alcohol consumption was found in less than half of the sample for both Asians (43.2%) and Hispanics (39.2%). Binge drinking was found in 3.1% of Asians and 8.4% of Hispanics. Acculturation was significantly related to past year alcohol consumption for Hispanics, past year binge drinking for Asians, and binge drinking days for Asians, such that higher level of acculturation predicted a greater likelihood of alcohol consumption but decreased likelihood of binge drinking and fewer binge drinking days. The results indicate that acculturation may be related to alcohol consumption patterns for older immigrants. This suggests future needs to develop an in-depth understanding of the health behaviors of these immigrant elderly groups.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=85432415&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

The predictive power of two different operationalisations of fit was compared. School students (193 German host society members and 128 immigrants to Germany) participated in a questionnaire study. Findings revealed that both acculturation strategies of one group and relative ‘fit’ between immigrant and host society strategy preference were predictive of intergroup relations. In general, a strategy of integration was associated with more favourable intergroup relations in both groups, and a mismatch between host and immigrant preferred strategies yielded the most negative outcomes.

Vigorous-intensity leisure time physical activity (VLTPA) may provide health benefits with a shorter amount of time than moderate-to-light physical activity. However, VLTPA has been significantly understudied compared to LTPA in general. The purpose of this study is to examine the associations between educational attainment, acculturation, and VLTPA by gender among Latino adults in the U.S. Design: Nationally representative samples of Latino adults aged 25 years and older (n = 4393) from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey were analyzed. VLTPA was measured as the number of hours per week of VLTPA consisting of heavy sweating or large increases in breathing and heart rate. Acculturation was measured as the degree to which the English language versus the Spanish language was spoken most often. The zero-inflated Poisson regression model was constructed using the full information maximum likelihood estimation and controlling for a series of sociodemographic characteristics and relevant health behaviors. Results: Educational attainment was positively associated with VLTPA among Latino adults [exp(b) = 1.09, p < 0.05)]. Similarly, greater acculturation was associated with greater hours/week of VLTPA [exp(b) = 1.10, p < 0.05)]. Lastly, the effect of educational attainment on VLTPA significantly varied by gender. Conclusions: Education had a positive association and acculturation had negative association with the hours/week of VLTPA among Latinos. Also, the association between education and VLTPA was significantly stronger among women than men.

Acculturation is a process that can occur when two or more cultures interact. There are several possible outcomes of this process, including assimilation whereby the host culture absorbs the immigrant culture or multiculturalism whereby both cultures exist side by side. The comparison of factor analyses confirms the hypothesis that the underlying factor structure of acculturation seems similar for the samples both of Singapore Asians and Asian Americans, at least where the definition of acculturation derived from the SL-ASIA scale. If one takes the amount of variance accounted for by the major factors as being indicative of what is associated with different levels of acculturation, then the major variables would seem to be reading, writing, cultural preferences and ethnic interactions. In other words, for the Asian samples in either country, a person's level of acculturation seems to be predictable if two variables, are known, the person's language skills and preferred language in which to communicate and to be entertained, and the ethnic backgrounds of persons selected as friends.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=9507203703&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Accordingly, Fiore et al. propose a national action plan for tobacco cessation and Fagan et al. note the breadth of research needed, from basic biology to public policy. In examining health disparities, it is essential to recognize the disproportionate toll of tobacco-related illness on racial and ethnic minorities, which is exacerbated by persistent and intertwined relationships with socioeconomic disadvantage, gender and sexuality.

Method: A semistructured interview including questionnaires assessing sociodemographic information, pre-migration trauma, anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress, post-migration living difficulties and perceived social support were administered assisted by a bilingual community worker. Results: Resettled refugees from Sudan evidenced a history of trauma. Less than 5% met criteria for posttraumatic stress but 25% reported clinically high levels of psychological distress. The results indicate that social support – particularly perceived social support from the migrant's ethnic community – play a significant role in predicting mental health outcomes.

Furthermore, the fit between migrants' personal values and the values they expect to encounter in the new home country (i.e. perceived value congruence) was hypothesized to predict anticipated socio-cultural adaptation (ASCA). The study took into account perceived cultural distance variables as well as socio-demographic controls traditionally related to adaptation outcomes among migrants. According to the results, familiarity with the host country (i.e., the number of Finnish friends/relatives in Finland), the openness to change value and perceived value congruence significantly predicted potential migrants' ASCA. When using four sub-scales (interpersonal relations, cognitive understanding, impersonal perils and bureaucracy) of the ASCA-scale, a more complex picture emerged. The results suggest that future work should include values, particularly perceived value congruence, in the analysis of the cultural fit hypothesis, as well as find better means of supporting immigrant adjustment starting at the pre-migration stage.

Together with acculturation options consistent with Berry's (1997) model (full‐assimilation, full‐separation and full‐marginalisation), some variants of biculturalism emerged from the latent class analysis: full‐high and full‐low integration, which were not sensitive to life domains; and “alternate” acculturation options that were sensitive to life domains, with participants switching from their original culture to the host culture according to the peripheral and central domains.

In Studies 2 and 3, conducted with immigrants in Italy and in Portugal, respectively, the hypothesis was extended from an identification conceptualisation to an acculturation one.

The second aim was to examine adaptation differences among Muslim youth based on national origin and gender. Questionnaire data were collected during school classes from 6306 10th grade students in junior high schools in Oslo. Of the 1666 immigrants in the sample, 1060 (63.3%) originated in countries with majority Muslim population. Internalizing problems were measured in terms of depression and anxiety symptoms. Psychosocial adaptation included measures of general and acculturation-specific risks and resources. In general, Muslims youth appeared well-adapted. However, there were between group differences based on national origin and gender. Also, self-efficacy was identified as an important moderator between acculturation-specific risks and resources and mental health among boys.","http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=25894280&site=ehost-live&scope=site"
