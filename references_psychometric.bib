  Abstract = {This article reports the development of an acculturation scale for Southeast Asian immigrants. From factor analyses of responses on 13 items obtained from samples of three different Southeast Asian ethnic groups, i.e., Cambodians, Laotians, and Vietnamese, two subscales were derived: (1) proficiency in languages (land of origin versus English), and (2) language, social and food (LSF) preferences. Inter-item reliability of the scales was demonstrated for each of the three ethnic groups, with Cronbach alpha coefficients of 0.76 or above. Construct validity was also established within each of the three ethnic groups by demonstrating expected associations of the subscales with current age, years in the USA, total years of education, percentage of lifetime in the USA, and age on entering the USA. Multivariate analyses within each of the ethnic groups revealed that, once controlling for years of education, percentage of lifetime in the USA, and type of health care coverage, although not significant for the Cambodians (P=0.08) males tended to show higher scores for the proficiency in language subscale in comparison to females. Similar multivariate analyses for the LSF preference subscale showed that although slightly higher for the males, the differences between the genders was not significant for the Cambodians (P=0.78); both the Laotian (P=0.23) and Vietnamese (P=0.01) females showed higher scores in comparison to males although only just reaching significance for the Vietnamese. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.},

Several hypotheses derived from Gordon's seven-stage model of the assimilation process are tested. The results of these analyses not only provide evidence of the scales' construct validity but pro- vide rich information about the acculturation and assimilation experience of an important segment of the Mexican American population.

  Abstract = {Background. Musculoskeletal pain is reported more commonly by South Asians in the UK than by white Europeans. This may result from a variety of factors, including cultural differences, and thus we investigated the extent to which differences in the prevalence of pain within the South Asian population could be explained by differences in acculturation (the extent to which immigrants take on the culture of their host population). Methods. Nine hundred and thirty-three Europeans and 1914 South Asian (1165 Indian, 401 Pakistani and 348 Bangladeshi) subjects were recruited from the age-sex registers of 13 general practices in areas with high densities of South Asian populations (Bolton, Oldham, Ashton-under-Lyne and Birmingham). A 28-item acculturation scale was developed, based, on aspects including use of language, clothing style, and use of own-culture media. Principle component analysis generated a score (range 0-100), which was validated against constructs expected to relate to acculturation, such as years of full time education and time spent in the UK. The presence of widespread pain was assessed by the answer to the question 'Have you suffered from pain all over the body in the past month?' Results. Widespread pain was more common in all three South Asian ethnic groups than in the white Europeans [odds ratio (OR) = 3.7, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.9-4.9], with this increase ranging from 2.7 to 5.8 in the different South Asian subgroups. There was a similar increase in consultation rates for pain. Within the South Asians, pooling all three groups, there was a strong negative association between acculturation score and widespread pain, which remained after adjusting for age and sex: [OR (95\% CI) per standard deviation decrease in acculturation score -1.2 (1.0-1.3)]. Adjusting for acculturation accounted for some, but not all, of the differences between the ethnic groups in the prevalence of widespread pain: OR 2.0 (95\% CI 1.4-3.0). Conclusions. Widespread pain is more commonly reported in South Asians though there are interesting differences within the South Asian community. Lower acculturation has a strong influence on the reporting of pain, but cannot explain all of the difference between South Asian and European populations. © The Author 2007.

Construct validity was established by significant asociations of the scale with ethnicity, place of birth, generation within the United States, and type of neighborhood. Highly significant associations were found between scale scores and use of oral contraceptives, parity, 'fatalism' regarding health, and attitudes toward folk healers. These associations remained significant (though weak) after controlling for education and family income. The language scale thus appears to be reliable and valid, to be capable of distinguishing meaningful subsets among the Mexican American population, and to be applicable to health care investigation.},

Core culture shock items were derived from a consensus statement from the literature on culture shock. Additional items were obtained from an analysis of reports by previous volunteers. Internal consistency of items, as determined by correlation coefficients and factor analysis, was satisfactory; this also lends some empirical support to the concept of culture shock. External criterion validity was established by reference to the country of destination and correlation with a measure of cultural distance. A 12-item questionnaire to measure culture shock is offered for further use and evaluation.},

This study uses data from the first five rounds of the European Social Survey to examine acculturation among migrants moving from Eastern Europe to Western Europe, in terms of attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. After controlling for background factors associated with attitudes toward homosexuality, we find evidence of acculturation, whereby attitudes become more tolerant—and more typical of those prevalent in Western Europe—with longer residency in this region. This study builds on existing research into cross-national differences in attitudes toward homosexuality and extends the existing North American literature on acculturation to a European context.},

Confirmatory factor analysis supported the proposed factor model. The DI subscales were internally consistent and had good test-retest reliability. Support for concurrent validity was demonstrated by correlations in the expected direction between the DI total and subscale scores and measures of depression and somatization. Support for discriminant validity was demonstrated by mean group differences in some or all of the DI dimensions according to age and years in the United States.},

The focus groups and a preliminary item refinement result in the 50-item Mexican American Cultural Values Scale (MACVS; identical for adolescents and adults) that includes 9 subscales. Analyses of data from two large previously published studies sampling Mexican American adolescents, mothers, and fathers provide evidence of the expected two correlated higher order factor structures, reliability, and construct validity of the subscales of the MACVS as indicators of values that are frequently associated with Mexican/Mexican American culture. The utility of this measure for use in longitudinal research and in resolving some important theoretical questions regarding dual cultural adaptation is discussed. © The Author(s) 2010.},

  Abstract = {In the past, epidemiologic research on acculturation and health has been criticized for its conceptual ambiguity and simplistic measurement approaches. This study applied a widely-used theoretical framework from cross-cultural psychology to identify acculturation strategies among South Asian immigrants in the US and to examine sociodemographic correlates of acculturation strategies. Data were from the Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America study. We used latent class analysis to identify groups of individuals that were similar based on cultural attitudes and behaviors. We used latent class regression analysis to examine sociodemographic correlates of acculturation strategies. We found that South Asian immigrants employed three acculturation strategies, including separation (characterized by a relatively high degree of preference for South Asian culture over US culture), assimilation (characterized by a relatively high degree of preference for US culture over South Asian culture), and integration (characterized by a similar level of preference for South Asian and US cultures). Respondents with no religious affiliation, those with higher levels of income, those who lived a greater percentage of their lives in the US, and those who spoke English well or very well were less likely to use the separation strategy than the assimilation or integration strategies. Using epidemiologic cohort data, this study illustrated a conceptual and methodological approach that addresses limitations of previous research on acculturation and health. More work is needed to understand how the acculturation strategies identified in this study affect the health of South Asian immigrants in the US.},

Data was gathered via a survey administered to 265 respondents with Chinese origin. Results indicate that exposure to mainstream newspapers is only positively related to one indicator of subjective reality, namely, outgroup perception whereas exposure to ethnic newspapers was not significantly related to any of the indicators of subjective reality. Acculturation attitudes, on the other hand, are more closely related to group perception and contact but not closely associated with exposure to print media. These findings have again challenged the "direct effect" assumption of cultivation theory, paved the ground for combining mediated communication variables with interpersonal communication variables in acculturation research and suggested policy implications for interethnic coexistence. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The use of this scale indicated that the degree of American Indian blood quantum, blood quantum for primary tribe, and self-identification are correlated to the traditional behavior scale. The scale, however, was unable to predict intention to get a Pap test. Results indicate that it is useful to understand the variation of traditional behavior within the specific population group to be served when planning and implementing culturally appropriate interventions for American Indian women. It is also useful to evaluate which segments of the population current programs are reaching.},

Items that some participants in prior studies found objectionable were dropped, and a new version of the scale was created by factor analyzing the remaining items. The revised AAAS (AAAS-R) consists of 47 items that no participant has objected to; these comprise eight new, empirically derived subscales (i.e., factors) that have high reliability and validity and correlate r = .97 with the original 74-item version of the scale. It is strongly recommended that researchers interested in studying acculturation among African Americans use this new version of the scale. © 2000, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.},

We first describe a schema that facilitates the planning of strategies associated with preferred health interventions and preventive approaches for cancer risk reduction with Mexican American and other Latino/Hispanic persons. This schema examines Acculturation and Education as key factors that should be considered in developing health education messages and interventions that are culturally and educationally appropriate to the identified subpopulations of Hispanics in terms of language and informational content of the message and in terms of psychological factors related to health behavior change. Empirical data from a community sample is presented for the purpose of illustrating the validity of this schema.},

Although some scholars have suggested that the inability of the spouse to adjust is one of the major reasons expatriate managers return early from their overseas assignments, few researchers have attempted to verify empirically a relationship between the spouse's adjustment and the adjustment and intentions to stay or leave of the expatriate manager. This study found that a favorable opinion about the overseas assignment by the spouse is positively related to the spouse's adjustment and the novelty of the foreign culture has a negative relationship with the spouse's adjustment. Additionally, the adjustment of the spouse is highly correlated to the adjustment of the expatriate manager and the adjustment of the spouse and the expatriate are positively related to the expatriate's intention to stay in the overseas assignment.},

Building on previous measurement efforts, this study examined the validity and generalizability of place attachment across measurement items, places, and dimensions (place dependence and place identity) of attachment. Colorado State University students (n = 65) rated four forest-based recreation sites on two dimensions of place attachment. In addition, data from a sample of University of Illinois students (n = 380) and visitors to Shenandoah National Park (n = 2005) and Mt. Rogers National Recreation Area (n = 369) were analyzed and compared to the Colorado sample. Confirmatory factor analysis of these four data sets demonstrated that subjects distinguish between two dimensions of attachment and assign different levels of attachment to the different areas. Generalizability analysis of the Colorado data provided additional evidence for the two-dimensional structure and suggested that each attachment dimension can be reliably measured with as few as four questionnaire items. Convergent validity was supported through analyses of the relationships between the place attachment measures and both behavioral and psychological variables predicted to be related to place attachment.},

Factor analyses with principal axis factoring extractions and direct oblimin rotations were used to identify the underlying structure of ARSAA-II. Factor analysis confirmed the underlying structure of ARSAA-II and produced two interpretable factors labeled as ‘Attraction to American Culture’ (AAmC) and ‘Attraction to Arabic Culture’ (AArC). The Cronbach’s alphas of AAmC and AArC were.89 and.85 respectively. Findings support ARSAA-II A \& E to assess acculturation among Arab Americans.

Methods: Participants, 603 Mexican-American men and 893 women aged 50 and older who had not been diagnosed with colon cancer, reported CRC screening behavior on the 2005 California Health Interview Survey. A 7-item acculturation index (English language use/proficiency, nativity, citizenship, and years living in the U.S.) was developed. A logistic regression model predicted CRC screening as a function of acculturation. Results: Higher acculturated Mexican- Americans were 3–4 times more likely to have had both fecal occult blood test and endoscopic CRC screening. Lower acculturated Mexican men and women were twice as likely to not have any CRC screening. Discussion: Colorectal screening is effective in preventing cancer; educational and outreach efforts and efforts to decrease language barriers among lower-acculturated Mexican- Americans should be intensified.

Integrating conceptions from the social identity perspective with those from research on individualism-collectivism, nationalism- patriotism, and identification with organizations, we propose four conceptually distinct modes of identification: importance (how much I view the group as part of who I am), commitment (how much I want to benefit the group), superiority (how much I view my group as superior to other groups), and deference (how much I honor, revere, and submit to the group's norms, symbols, and leaders). We present an instrument for assessing the four modes of identification and review initial empirical findings that validate the proposed model and show its utility in understanding antecedents and consequences of identification. © 2008 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.},

  Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to understand the role of physical activity and sport in the process of acculturation of immigrant students in secondary schools enrolled in formal education in the province of Almeria (Spain). For this purpose, we have created the Physical Activity and Sport Acculturation Index (PASAI), following the main dimensions that define the social integration of immigrants in the field of physical activity and sport (PAS): mixed relationships, cultural references, engagement and transnationality. A survey was administered to 221 immigrant students, aged 14 to 18 years, enrolled in secondary schools. The results show that the levels of participation in physical activity and sport in young immigrants were lower than the Spanish. Moreover, generation and origin emerged as important elements in the process of sport acculturation; young African—Sub Saharan and Maghrebi—immigrants obtained a lower degree of sports acculturation; and the first generation students attained a lower level of sports acculturation than those of the 1.5 and second generations. In conclusion, schools should review their educational activities if they want to eliminate inequalities in the acculturation process of students from different origins.

  Abstract = {This article uses 20 years of survey data from the Mexican Migration Project to describe how the experiences of Mexico-U.S. migrants have changed over time. I use survey questions about migrants’ experiences on their last U.S. trip to develop composite indices of six integration domains, and then estimate random intercept linear regression models with individual-, family-, and community-level characteristics to explain variations in Mexican migrant integration. I find that, over time, Mexican migrant linguistic and social integration has steadily increased, whereas integration in other family and economic domains changed little or not at all. Results from the multivariate models show the importance of human capital to integration across the multiple domains. Higher education, more time spent in the country of destination, and being male are all strongly associated with higher levels of integration. I also find evidence that both family and community migration networks facilitate integration.},

Analyses are based on a sample of Latino college students in the United States followed across eight consecutive semesters (N= 97; Mage= 18). In support of the hypotheses, a significant interaction was found between discrimination and national identity. In particular, perceived discrimination in the first year of college was positively associated with changes in ethnic identity commitment across the college years among participants with a weaker national identity, but negatively associated with changes in ethnic identity commitment among participants with a stronger national identity. Higher levels of national identity were also associated with greater increases in ethnic identity commitment over time. © 2012 The Authors. © 2012 International Association of Applied Psychology.},

Data was obtained via a survey administered to 133 Asian immigrants and 108 Anglo-Australians, a total of 241 respondents. Results revealed discordance in attitudes towards multiculturalism between Asians and Australians, with Asians rating it higher as a benefit and lower as a threat as compared to Australians. While higher ratings on multiculturalism as a threat tended to be positively related to separation strategy, this linear association did not hold true for the minority group (Asians). For Asian respondents, those who perceived a moderate threat in multiculturalism were more likely supporters for separation. Our findings supported the assumption that multiculturalism is viewed as differentially beneficial for minority and majority groups. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Results show that self-reported life satisfaction strongly depends on immigrants’ demographic characteristics and human capital factors, such as age, marital status, current economic situation and perceived financial well-being. ‘Immigration’ variables also play a role in determining life satisfaction, thus proving that conditions at both the origin and destination are important in determining immigrants’ self-reported life satisfaction. In particular, legal status and country of residence play a significant role in defining immigrants’ life satisfaction, thus demonstrating that the rights, resources and restrictions immigrants find within their country of residence determine their subjective experience of integration.},

  Abstract = {Background: Health disparities in chronic disease prevalence exist in the United States among racial/ethnic groups. This study explores relationships between physical, socioeconomic, and cultural characteristics of a multi-ethnic sample of early adolescent females which may assist health educators in designing programs targeting these groups. Methods: Mexican-American and Asian-American sixth grade females (n = 144) were enrolled in Adequate Calcium Today. Physical measurements included weight, height, and BMI. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry determined percent body fat (\%BF). Socioeconomic status was determined by enrollment in free or reduced meal program (FRMP). An adapted Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican-Americans-II (ARSMA-II) measured acculturation. Results: Mexican-Americans had greater height, BMI, \%BF, and a greater tendency toward overweight (P {\textless} 0.01) than Asian-American. Asian-Americans were more acculturated than MA (P {\textless} 0.005), attributed to a lower ethnic orientation scale score. Within Asian-Americans, \%BF was higher among FRMP participants than non-participants (P {\textless} 0.05). Discussion: Income and acculturation may affect tendency toward chronic disease.

Acculturation takes place when a person changes from ethnic to American, from military to civilian life, from one region of the country to another, from rural to urban living, or from one social class to another. This study is concerned primarily with acculturation of immigrants or their children and grandchildren. Observation was made that various nationalities presented different problems of acculturation. Psychotherapy has to work out the problems of motivation for culture change, and touch upon early childhood identifications. Eventually a belated identification can be accomplished through successful identification with the psychotherapist, which in turn will make it possible for the individual to accept the majority of the new values.

Dimensions and scales of subjective well-being are reviewed and conceived of as mental health symptoms. A diagnosis of the presence of mental health, described as flourishing, and the absence of mental health, characterized as languishing, is applied to data from the 1995 Midlife in the United States study of adults between the ages of25 and 74 (n = 3,032). Findings revealed that 17.2 percent fit the criteria for flourishing, 56.6 percent were moderately mentally healthy, 12.1 percent of adults fit the criteria for languishing, and 14.1 percent fit the criteriafor DSM-III-R major depressive episode (12-month), of which 9.4 percent were not languishing and 4.7 percent were also languishing. The risk of a major depressive episode was two times more likely among languishing than moderately mentally healthy adults, and nearly six times greater among lan- guishing than flourishing adults. Multivariate analyses revealed that languish- ing and depression were associated with signif icant psychosocial impairment in terms ofperceived emotional health, limitations of activities of daily living, and workdays lost or cutback. Flourishing and moderate mental health were asso- ciated with superior profiles of psychosocialfunctioning. The descriptive epi- demiology revealed that males, older adults, more educated individuals, and married adults were more likely to be mentally healthy. Implications for the con- ception of mental health and the treatment and prevention of mental illness are discussed},

  Abstract = {Newly-arrived African refugees are a vulnerable group of immigrants for whom no validated acculturation measures exist. A valid measurement tool is essential to understand how acculturative processes impact health and health disparities. We adapted the Bicultural Involvement Questionnaire (BIQ) to characterize its reliability among ethnic Somali women residing in Minnesota, and Somali, Somali Bantu, and Burundian women in Arizona. Surveys were administered to 164 adult women. Analyses were conducted along socio-demographic variables of ethnicity, geographic residence, age, and length of time in the United States through t tests and one-way analysis of variance. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted on the modified BIQ. Exploratory factor analyses yielded five subscales: “Speak Native Language”, “Speak English Language”, “Enjoy Native Activities”, “Enjoy American Activities”, and “Desired Ideal Culture”. The subscales of the modified BIQ possessed Cronbach’s α ranging from 0.68 to 0.92, suggestive that all subscales had acceptable to excellent internal consistency. The modified BIQ maintained its psychometric properties across geographic regions of resettled Central and East African refugees.},

Participants completed a questionnaire similar to that used by Navas et al., reworked for a different context (Italian) and age (adolescents) and distributed in two versions: for hosts and for migrants. Differences both at an intergroup level of analysis (between hosts and migrants points of view) and at an intraindividual one (between acculturation strategies and attitudes) were explored referring to three central (family, religious and way of thinking) and three peripheral (school, economic habits and friendships/relationships) domains of acculturation. For strategies, results about hosts' perspective showed a perception of migrants as separated, more in the central domain than in the peripheral one. This perception does not coincide with the choice of migrants who declared to use integration strategy in both kinds of life domains. Also for attitudes results demonstrated high discordances, while migrants reported that they would prefer integration into the peripheral domain and separation into the central one, hosts reported that they would prefer migrants adopted assimilation, regardless of esteemed domains. These discordances at intergroup as well as at intrapersonal level of analysis, predict conflictual intercultural relations more in central than in peripheral domains. Data also showed that for host adolescent types of intercultural relations empirically predicted attitudes toward the immigrants. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  Year = {2012},
  Abstract = {Expatriates' degree of adjustment to living and working in a foreign country is well-accepted as an important outcome variable in expatriate management research. However, measures of degree of adjustment do not capture the breadth of strategies expatriates may use to achieve such adjustment, which may be critical for understanding whether expatriates have achieved a healthy and productive orientation to life abroad. Borrowing from research on immigrant populations, this study examines the construct of expatriate acculturation strategies, which characterize expatriates' mode of adjustment along two independent dimensions reflecting maintenance of one's home culture and engagement of the host culture, respectively. One hundred U.S. expatriates were recruited and completed an index of acculturation strategies. In addition, participants completed survey and reaction-time based measures of proposed antecedents, correlates, and outcomes of varying acculturation strategies. Results suggest that expatriates largely pursue either a maintenance-focused or engagement-focused strategy and that acculturation strategies are not redundant with degree of adjustment. Relationships between acculturation strategies and relevant individual differences, characteristics of expatriate positions, and outcomes are discussed.

A validated Asian Indian Dietary Acculturation Measure (AIDAM) and the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) were completed by 153 Asian Indians in the U.S. via a cross-sectional web-survey. Correlations and relative risk ratios were used to examine the association between AIDAM and FINDRISC. A significantly larger proportion of Non-Indian Oriented participants (44.7 \%) had higher FINDRISC scores (scores 7–26) compared to the Asian Indian Oriented group (27.9 \%) (p = .024), and also had increased relative predictive risk for type 2 diabetes (relative risk ratio = 1.6). A positive association between dietary acculturation and diabetes risk was evident in our sample, which highlights the importance of assessing dietary acculturation in non-native groups when investigating type 2 diabetes risk factors.

Most subjects would like to retain their parent culture but would also like to assimilate into the host culture, indicating a preference for an integrated mode of acculturation. Those who were older, widowed, less educated, had shorter duration of stay in New Zealand, and of lower socioeconomic status, were less acculturated. Overall, the least acculturated were found to have the highest rate of psychiatric morbidity. When age and sex were controlled, the association between acculturation and psychiatric morbidity remained significant only for women aged 31 to 50. Overall, the associations between psychiatric morbidity and acculturation held true for marital status, duration of stay in N.Z., educational level, and socioeconomic status.

  Abstract = {Background: Acculturation is the phenomenon that results when a group with one culture comes into continuous contact with a host culture and changes occur in the original culture of either one or both groups. Acculturation has also been linked with stress-related psychological disorder and depression. Aims: This article investigates the acculturation process and the depressive state of foreign immigrants living in the greater Athens area. Methods: All consecutive cases of 157 foreign immigrants who visited a non-governmental organization (NGO) providing consultative services to immigrants were interviewed using a structured questionnaire including the Immigrant Acculturation Scale (IAS) and the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression (CES-D) scale. Results: Factor analysis of IAS yielded a three-factor solution and 17 items with loadings ranging from 0.74 to 0.41. This scale was also tested and proven to be reliable. The main finding is that the higher the acculturation level of the immigrant individual, the lower the CES-D scale score; the fewer the depressive symptoms are self-reported. Length of stay, existence of family in Greece, legal status of residence and employment were also found to have an effect on depressive symptomatology. Conclusion: Acculturation could be seen as a beneficial mechanism protecting the individual to be exposed to stressful non-adaptive behaviour. © 2008 Sage Publications.},

Representative samples of immigrants and long-time Israelis completed a 67-item questionnaire where each item represented a criterion of sociocultural adjustment. These items were organized by factor analysis into 12 spheres of sociocultural adjustment (e.g., psychological, economical, educational, etc.). The immigrants preferred the selected acculturation model of sociocultural adjustment: selective adoption of the target culture while maintaining an affinity to the native one. In comparison, the host Israelis favored an integrative model: general (unselective) adoption of the new culture and preservation of an affinity to the native one. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

In a sample of 349 immigrants living in Germany (199 Turks and 150 North-Africans), we investigated the influence of emotional intelligence (EI) with the Trait-Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS). Acculturation styles were assessed with the Acculturation Attitudes Scale (AAS) as well as specific markers of acculturation behavior. Adjustment was captured by the Satisfaction with life scale (SWLS), the subjective happiness scale (SHS), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) as an inverse marker. Additionally, we assessed perceived unfairness and discrimination. Findings show that EI and its subcomponents are related to beneficial forms of acculturation attitudes and acculturation behavior. EI was also shown to affect acculturation experiences, such as perceived discrimination and perceived unfairness, as well as a number of psychological adjustment variables.},

Given the current socio-political climate and the limited research, the present exploratory study explores the relationship between acculturation, ethnic identity, self-identity, generational status, religiosity, and demographics among adult Australian Muslims. A cross-sectional convenience sample of 324 adult Australian Muslims completed either online or paper-based questionnaires in either English or Arabic. Recruitment was via convenience sampling and social media advertisements. Acculturation, ethnic identity (MEIM), religiosity, and demographic variables were measured. The study sample was young and mostly female, with high religiosity levels. Acculturation was negatively correlated with ethnic identity. From multiple regression analysis, acculturation was predicted independently by religiosity (low), age (young), gender (male) and ethnic identity (low). First generation Australian Muslims were older, had stronger ethnic identity and religiosity, and more commonly self-identified as non-Australian. By contrast second- and third-generation were more likely to self-identify as bicultural or Australian. In summary, acculturation of Australian Muslims is influenced by multiple variables, particularly ethnic identity, religiosity, and generation; hence all these variables need to be included in policy regarding successful integration of migrants.},

Satisfactory reliability is reported for the four acculturation scales: assimilation, separation, integration, and marginalization. Length of stay was not associated with separation but was significantly positively associated with assimilation and integration and significantly negatively associated with marginalization. Gender was not associated with any of the acculturation scales.

  Abstract = {This study examined the role of value patterns of potential migrants from Russia to Finland (N = 229) in predicting expectations of post-migration socio-cultural adaptation. Furthermore, the fit between migrants’ personal values and the values they expect to encounter in the new home country (i.e. perceived value congruence) was hypothesized to predict anticipated socio-cultural adaptation (ASCA). The study took into account perceived cultural distance variables as well as socio-demographic controls traditionally related to adaptation outcomes among migrants. According to the results, familiarity with the host country (i.e., the number of Finnish friends/relatives in Finland), the openness to change value and perceived value congruence significantly predicted potential migrants’ ASCA. When using four sub-scales (interpersonal relations, cognitive understanding, impersonal perils and bureaucracy) of the ASCA-scale, a more complex picture emerged. The results suggest that future work should include values, particularly perceived value congruence, in the analysis of the cultural fit hypothesis, as well as find better means of supporting immigrant adjustment starting at the pre-migration stage.

  Abstract = {The study examines how a sample of 210 high-school immigrant students (ages 14-15) from Ethiopia and the former USSR socially represent their notion of what klitat aliyah (successful adaptation to Israel) means. Prevalent relevant theories - Berry's model of Acculturation Tendencies (BAT), Social Identity Theory (SIT) and Social Comparison Theory (SCT) - suggest three kinds of patterns by which minority or socially weak groups deal with these kinds of situations. These underlying patterns were tested by a 47-item questionnaire (with a 4-point Likert-like scale), constructed from immigrant narratives regarding their klitat aliyah according to SIT, SCT and BAT categories of adaptation strategies. A Guttman non-parametric Similarity Structure Analysis (SSA) revealed four-facet organization of items for both males and females in both sub-samples. These facets, which reflected social representations of Israeli society, were dubbed: Extended Identity, Rivalry Identity, Secluded Identity and Identity Loss. Results did not confirm the underlying categorization of strategies suggested by SIT and SCT, and partially replicated those suggested by BAT. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This study investigated exposure to neighborhood violence, relationship violence, and forced sex among 677 urban African Americans aged 16-23 enrolled at an employment and training center We assessed prevalence of each violence exposure type, the relation of each exposure type to depressive symptoms, and the extent to which exposure to multiple violence types is additively associated with depressive symptoms. Potential gender differences were also explored. Nearly 60\% of our sample reported violence exposure, with males reporting more neighborhood violence and females reporting more forced sex. For both genders, each violence exposure domain was independently associated with depressive symptoms, and exposures in multiple domains had an additive effect on depressive symptom levels. These findings have implications for developing strategies to improve mental health outcomes among urban adolescents and young adults. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  Abstract = {Background: Turkish migrants in the Netherlands have a high prevalence of depressive and/or anxiety disorders. Acculturation has been shown to be related to higher levels of psychological distress, although it is not clear whether this also holds for depressive and anxiety disorders in Turkish migrants. This study aims to clarify the relationship between acculturation strategies (integration, assimilation, separation and marginalization) and the prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders as well as utilisation of GP care among Turkish migrants. Methods: Existing data from an epidemiological study conducted among Dutch, Turkish and Moroccan inhabitants of Amsterdam were re-examined. Four scales of acculturation strategies were created in combination with the bi-dimensional approach of acculturation by factor analysis. The Lowlands Acculturation Scale and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview were used to assess acculturation and mood and anxiety disorders. Socio-demographic variables, depressive, anxiety and co-morbidity of both disorders and the use of health care services were associated with the four acculturation strategies by means of Chi-Squared and Likelihood tests. Three two-step logistic regression analyses were performed to control for possible, confounding variables. Results: The sample consisted of 210 Turkish migrants. Significant associations were found between the acculturation strategies and age (p {\textless} .01), education (p {\textless} .01), daily occupation (p {\textless} .01) and having a long-term relationship (p = .03). A significant association was found between acculturation strategies and depressive disorders (p = .049): integration was associated with a lower risk of depression, separation with a higher risk. Using the axis separately, participation in Dutch society showed a significant relationship with a decreased risk of depressive, anxiety and co-morbidity of both disorders (OR = .15; 95\% CI: .024 - .98). Non-participation showed no significant association. No association was found between the acculturation strategies and uptake of GP care. Conclusions: Turkish migrants who integrate may have a lower risk of developing a depressive disorder. Participation in Dutch culture is associated with a decreased risk of depressive, anxiety and co-morbidity of both disorders. Further research should focus on the assessment of acculturation in the detection of depression. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

  Abstract = {International migration trends have heralded a marked increase in intercultural contact, creating a greater need for effective cultural competency in both inter- and intra-cultural situations. The current research programme, positioned within the field of acculturation psychology, examined a specific behavioural aspect of cultural competency known as sociocultural adaptation. Defined as an individual’s acquisition and expression of culturally appropriate behavioural skills used to negotiate interactive aspects of a new cultural setting, an in-depth examination of the sociocultural adaptation construct was provided. Three studies addressed issues concerning the review, revision, and expansion of work on the topic of cross-cultural behavioural competency. Study 1 offered a meta-analytic review of the correlates or antecedents of sociocultural adaptation. Results emphasised the importance of individual differences, such as personality characteristics and motivation, in relation to adaptation difficulties. Suggestions were also provided for future theoretical and applied research regarding how demographic (e.g, age, gender), situational (e.g., language proficiency), and individual differences (e.g., cross-cultural empathy) components relate to and influence an individual’s successful cross-cultural adjustment. Study 2 examined the operationalisation of behavioural competency through revision of an existing measure of sociocultural adaptation (the Sociocultural Adaptation Scale or SCAS) and investigated five adjustment domains: Ecological, interpersonal, personal interests and community involvement, language, and professional/work adjustment. The final study sought to corroborate the factor structure of the revised SCAS and explored the effects of migration motivation and perceived discrimination—two underrepresented variables in the acculturation literature—in relation to cross-cultural adjustment using path analysis techniques. Direct linkages were found between migration motivation and positive psychological outcomes, and behavioural competency and discrimination were found to have significant mediating effects on the relationship between these two variables. The limitations and contributions of these studies are discussed in relation to the existing acculturation psychology literature, and new avenues for theoretical and applied applications of the findings are suggested.},

  Abstract = {The present study evaluated the integration of elderly people who migrated to Israel during their lifetimes. Subjective well-being, as measured by the immigrants’ perception of quality of life, satisfaction with life and emotional state, served as a general indicator of integration. The integration of elderly immigrants has not received adequate attention in the literature. A unique database (SHARE-Israel) that was recently released has made study of this topic possible. The current study sample was composed of former migrants aged 50 and older (n = 930). The analytic model examined ethnic origin and migration variables in relation to the respective subjective outcomes, controlling for sociodemographic background, human and social capital and health. The findings show that in general, ethnic origin seems to matter less for the evaluation of immigrants’ subjective well-being than other socio economic factors such as economic status, social capital and health status. However, recent arrivals from the Former Soviet Union do differ from all other immigrant groups in their lower levels of well-being. In addition, the study points to the importance of language proficiency as a central means for integration in the destination country. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  Abstract = {The worldwide volume and social relevance of migratory processes justify the need to study the psychological acculturation of the host and immigrant populations through a model adapted to the social context in which they develop. Therefore, the main objective of this article is to carry out a review of some of the existing acculturation models (e.g., Berry, Kim, Power, Young, \& Bujaki. (1989). Applied Psychology, 38, 185-206; Bourhis, Moïse, Perreault, \& Senécal. (1997). International Journal of Psychology, 32(6), 269-386; Piontkowski, Florack, Hoelker, \& Obdrzálek. (2000). International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 24, 1-26), ending up with a proposal for a Relative Acculturation Extended Model (RAEM). This theoretical framework gathers some elements from previous models and adds some new ones in order to offer new explanations for the acculturation strategies and attitudes preferred by both the native and immigrant populations. The most relevant contributions of the RAEM can be summarised as, on the one hand, the consideration of different acculturation domains (political, work, economic, family, social, religion and ways of thinking) and on the other, the differentiation between the acculturation strategies adopted in reality and the acculturation attitudes ideally preferred by the groups in contact. This model also takes into account the ethnocultural origin of immigrants and some variables predicting and modulating their acculturation strategies and attitudes. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract = {The devastating effects of experiencing violence in childhood are seen well into adulthood. This has been particularly difficult to assess among South Asians living in the U.S., due to a lack of disaggregated data on this ethnic group. In a web-based survey administered to a convenience sample of South Asian women living in the U.S. (n = 535), information was gathered on experience/exposure to childhood violence; adult intimate partner violence; and adverse health outcomes, including ever suicide ideation/attempt, experiences of quality of life and body esteem in adulthood. Further, an individual’s acculturation levels were measured specifically looking at cultural identity which was guided by Berry’s biculturalism model. This study found that acculturation status is a key factor with respect to childhood verbal, physical, and sexual abuse, as well as body esteem and an individual’s well-being. These results suggest that acculturation plays a key role for childhood violence, as well as key adult health indicators. The findings in this study, suggest that more research is warranted to better understand the complex relationships between acculturation status and health. While studies of South Asian immigrants have increased substantially, the study on how acculturation influences family violence and health outcomes has lagged behind. The findings in this study will provide guidance for future work in understanding how acculturation can play a key role in addressing the health and well-being of South Asian women in the U.S.},

  Year = {2007},
  Abstract = {Background. Due to the fast development of economies in China and the great needs of professionals in the US, the population of highly educated young Chinese professionals working in high-tech industries has grown very fast in both countries. This population was suggested to have risk of consuming high energy and fat diet in both countries. Objectives. This study aimed to investigate the associations of dietary intake with nutrition knowledge, attitude, dietary self-efficacy and acculturation among Chinese working in high-tech industries in China and in the US. Methods. This study was a cross-sectional self-administered online survey. We studied 925 Chinese aged 20-45 years, who worked in high-tech industries and had at least a bachelor degree in four sub-groups: employees of Chinese companies in China; employees of American companies in China; Chinese-born immigrant in the US; and American-born Chinese in the US. A web-based questionnaire including a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was developed to assess total energy and fat intakes, nutrition knowledge, attitudes, dietary self-efficacy. Four domains of acculturation were assessed among Chinese in the US. Using these data, we compared the four sub-groups and tested the prediction model of dietary intake and BMI. Results. Our results showed that American-born Chinese participants consumed significantly higher energy and fat than the other three groups. Participants in the US had higher nutrition knowledge, attitude and self-efficacy than participants in China. Chinese-born immigrant men in the US had the highest nutrition knowledge and attitude and the lowest prevalence of overweight among the four study groups of men. The study results suggested that preferring Chinese food and Chinese leisure activity are predictors of lower energy and fat intake in Chinese-born immigrants. Conclusions. The Chinese-born immigrants showed significant advantages in nutrition knowledge, attitude, and dietary self-efficacy and had the lowest prevalence of overweight in men. American-born Chinese consumed the highest energy and fat among the four study groups even though their nutrition knowledge, attitude and self-efficacy were high. Future nutrition promotion programs should make use of these cultural and environmental differences when designing theses programs. The web-based survey method can be utilized in future nutrition research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  Abstract = {Given the assumption that mass media reflect the cultural values of a society, this study investigates the effects of American and Korean mass media on Korean immigrants' acculturation process. Structural equation modeling and hierarchical regression modeling were used to evaluate how exposure to mass media is related to the acculturation process. The survey results from the two different analyses were consistent with each other, in that exposure to American mass media was a significant positive predictor for the acceptance of American cultural values and a significant negative predictor of the affinity for Korean cultural identity. However, exposure to Korean mass media was related to neither immigrant's affinity for Korean cultural identity nor acceptance of American cultural values. Thus, we surmise that even though Korean immigrants are frequently exposed to both American and Korean mass media, they tend to be Americanized instead of bicultural due to the strong effects of the American media.

Results confirmed our first hypothesis excepting the lien between republicanism and prejudice which was not significant. They show also that the lien between national identification and prejudice was mediated by the preference for the assimilation and for the multiculturalism.

Methods: Questionnaires assessing ethnic/cultural identity salience, achievement goals and motivational climate were completed by high school students with Greek (n = 927) and non-Greek (n = 366) ethnic origin. The ethnic/cultural identity salience questionnaire comprised four factors suggesting ethnic belonging, assimilation, feelings of being on the fringe of ethnic identity, and lack of desire to interact with members of other ethnic groups. Results: Multilevel modeling analyses indicated that task orientation and class learning oriented climate were positively linked with ethnic belonging and assimilation from the larger culture. On the other hand, ego orientation and class performance oriented climates were positively associated with feelings of being on the fringe of ethnic identity, and with lack of desire to interact with members of other ethnic groups. Conclusions: The present findings encourage the conduct of intervention studies emphasizing task orientation and decreasing ego orientation to promote mutual respect among ethnicities and acculturation from the larger culture. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The predictive utility of measures was demonstrated in associations between children's acculturation attitudes (or perceived discrepancies with those of the outgroup) and outcomes such as self-esteem and teacher ratings of emotional symptoms. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract = {Theories and methodologies within acculturation psychology have been advanced in order to capture the complex process of intercultural contact in various contexts. Differentiating globalization-based acculturation from immigrant-based acculturation has broadened the field of acculturation psychology to include groups who are exposed to global cultural streams without international migration. The globalization-based acculturation process in the North Indian region of Ladakh appears to be a tricultural encounter, suggesting an addendum to the bidimensional acculturation model for this group (and perhaps for others as well). This study explores the development, usability, and validity of a tridimensional acculturation measure aiming to capture the multicultural orientations initiated by the process of globalization in Ladakh. The tridimensional acculturation scale was found to fit the data significantly better compared to the bidimensional scale. Implications for the study of globalization-based acculturation are discussed.},

We examined acculturation and diet over time in 312 Chinese immigrant women in Philadelphia, recruited October 2005 to April 2008 and followed with interviews and dietary recalls until April 2010. Associations were modeled using generalized estimating equations to account for repeated measures over time. Increasing length of US residence was associated with a small ({\textasciitilde}1 \%/year) but significant increase in acculturation score (p {\textless} 0.0001), which in turn was significantly associated with increased energy density of the diet, percent of energy from fat, and sugar intake, and lower dietary moderation score. These findings provide longitudinal evidence that acculturation increases with length of US residence and is accompanied by dietary changes. However, the changes were small enough that their health impact is unclear. Factors besides acculturation that affect immigrant health and that affect the acculturation trajectory itself warrant investigation.},

  Title = {Host land or homeland?: {Civic}-cultural identity and banal integration in {Latvia}.},
  Year = {2017},
  Abstract = {This dissertation challenges conventional approaches in the study of minority integration by looking at the spaces in which integration occurs, rather than at instances of conflict. It develops a framework that considers banal manifestations of social integration in quotidian and national life. Concentrating on the case study of Russian-speakers and ethnic titulars in Latvia, it compares top-down, elite-led discourse on integration with lived interethnic interactions. In many conventional analyses, Latvia is considered a divided society wherein ethnic, linguistic, and cultural cleavages separate ethnic Latvians from the proportionally large population of Russian-speakers 'left behind' when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. This population has been analyzed through immigrant, diaspora, and fifth column frameworks that suggest Russian speakers remain outside of the Latvian state and nation, if not always civically, then certainly culturally. This dissertation argues the frameworks and indicators traditionally used to measure integration do not sufficiently consider integration in everyday experiences, and therefore overlook much of the integration that is occurring on the ground. Rather, banality -- or the lived experiences that fade into the hum of everyday life -- is an indicator of significant interpersonal and socio-national integration that incorporates minorities as active members of the nation. The dissertation considers relevant theories in the study of integration, nationalism, and identity to create frameworks of interpersonal and socio-national banal integration. These capture both person-to-person experiences and minority engagement with society and the state. The dissertation then links the theoretical concept with three critical elements in the Latvian integration debate. First, it notes the disconnect between top-down integration priorities and ground-level realities. Second, it examines banal integration in daily life, looking at interpersonal interactions, public spaces, and civic connections with the state. Finally, the dissertation considers the ways in which minorities engage as embedded members of the Latvian nation, looking at participation in cultural events and national holidays. Theoretically, this dissertation highlights the necessity of prioritizing banal, quotidian experiences over elite-led discourse in the study of integration. Methodologically, it accomplishes this goal through a multi-method approach, using extant document summary and analysis, medium-n survey data, and qualitative ethnography. Empirically, the dissertation pushes back against a narrative of conflict in Latvian and Russian-speaker relations. Indeed, it argues that not only is Latvian society far less divided than it discursively appears, in many cases, minorities see themselves as active members of the Latvian cultural and civic nation, not tangential to it. This dissertation is a dedicated analysis of the Latvian case, but contributes more broadly to the literature on post-Soviet diaspora and migration studies, integration studies, and questions of nationalism and identity in the modern global context.

  Abstract = {This study aimed to compare factors related to changes in perceived health status of Han Chinese (traditional Chinese) and Korean-Chinese (Chinese nationals of Korean descent) women after immigration to Korea. During summer 2013, a survey was conducted with 151 Han and 158 Korean-Chinese women married to Korean men. Most of the respondents reported either no changes (82\%) or positive changes (18\%) in their perceived health status after immigration. The results of the multiple logistic regression analyses indicated healthy dietary behavior was related to positive changes in the perceived health status of both groups (odds ratio [OR] = 7.4 for Han Chinese; OR = 14.6 for Korean-Chinese). Among Han Chinese women, the length of residence in Korea and the change in perceived health status showed a negative relation (OR = 0.2). In contrast, their level of acculturation and health perception were positive (OR = 7.5). However, these results did not apply to the Korean-Chinese women. In conclusion, factors related to changes in perceived health status differed between the 2 groups although they shared healthy dietary behaviors as a common factor. Therefore, policies and programs aimed at promoting immigrant women’s health should consider the differences between Han Chinese and Korean-Chinese.},

  Abstract = {Background: Culture shapes how people understand illness and death, but few studies examine whether acculturation influences patients' end-of-life treatment preferences and medical care. Methods and Findings: In this multi-site, prospective, longitudinal cohort study of terminally-ill cancer patients and their caregivers (n = 171 dyads), trained interviewers administered the United States Acculturation Scale (USAS). The USAS is a 19-item scale developed to assess the degree of "Americanization" in first generation or non-US born caregivers of terminally-ill cancer patients. We evaluated the internal consistency, concurrent, criterion, and content validity of the USAS. We also examined whether caregivers' USAS scores predicted patients' communication, treatment preferences, and end-of-life medical care in multivariable models that corrected for significant confounding influences (e.g. education, country of origin, English proficiency). The USAS measure was internally consistent (Cronbach α = 0.98); and significantly associated with US birthplace (r = 0.66, P{\textless}0.0001). USAS scores were predictive of patients' preferences for prognostic information (AOR = 1.31, 95\% CI:1.00-1.72), but not comfort asking physicians' questions about care (AOR 1.23, 95\% CI:0.87-1.73). They predicted patients' preferences for feeding tubes (AOR = 0.68, 95\% CI:0.49-0.99) and wish to avoid dying in an intensive care unit (AOR = 1.36, 95\% CI:1.05-1.76). Scores indicating greater acculturation were also associated with increased odds of patient participation in clinical trials (AOR = 2.20, 95\% CI:1.28-3.78), compared with lower USAS scores, and greater odds of patients receiving chemotherapy (AOR = 1.59, 95\% CI:1.20-2.12). Conclusion: The USAS is a reliable and valid measure of "Americanization" associated with advanced cancer patients' end-of-life preferences and care. USAS scores indicating greater caregiver acculturation were associated with increased odds of patient participation in cancer treatment (chemotherapy, clinical trials) compared with lower scores. Future studies should examine the effects of acculturation on end-of-life care to identify patient and provider factors that explain these effects and targets for future interventions to improve care (e.g., by designing more culturally-competent health education materials). © 2013 Wright et al.},

  Abstract = {Despite the abundance of research on disadvantaged minority group members, the research field on the ramifications of low group status is largely split between more material and psychological lines of explanation. There is also a lack of research on how subjectively perceived socio-economic status and discrimination cumulatively affect the sense of national belonging of ethnic minority group members. This survey study was conducted among Russian-speaking immigrants in Finland (N = 316) and Estonia (N = 501). The results in Estonia showed that for national identification to be high, both indicators of subjective group status had to be perceived as relatively high. In Finland, there was no interaction between the two indicators of subjectively perceived low group status. The study shows how perceptions of cumulative disadvantage may provoke a backlash in the form of immigrants’ psychological distancing from the national ingroup. The findings are discussed in relation to the pervasiveness of low status in different intergroup contexts and minority group members’ perceived investments to society.

  Abstract = {Objectives: Acculturation is a multidimensional process involving changes in behaviour and beliefs. Questionnaires developed to measure acculturation are typically designed for specific ethnic populations and adult experiences. This study developed a questionnaire that measures acculturation among ethnically diverse populations of youth that can be included as a module in population surveys. Methods: Questionnaires measuring acculturation in youth were identified in the literature. The importance of items from the existing questionnaires was determined using a Delphi process and this informed the development of our questionnaire. The questionnaire was then pilot tested using a sample of 248 Canadians aged 18–25 via an online system. Participants identified as East and South East Asian (27.8\%), South Asian (17.7\%) and Black (13.7\%). The majority were 1st (33.5\%) or 2nd generation immigrants (52.0\%). After redundant items were eliminated, exploratory factor analysis grouped items into domains, and, for each domain, internal consistency, and convergent validity with immigrant generation then age at immigration estimated. A subset of participants re-completed the questionnaire for reliability estimation. Results: The literature review yielded 117 articles that used 13 questionnaires with a total of 440 questions. The Delphi process reduced these to 32 questions. Pilot testing occurred in 248 Canadians aged 18–25. Following item reduction, 16 questions in three domains remained: dominant culture, heritage language, and heritage culture. All had good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alphas {\textgreater} .75). The mean dominant domain score increased with immigrant generation (1st generation: 3.69 (95\% CI: 3.49–3.89), 2nd: 4.13 (4.00–4.26), 3rd: 4.40 (4.19– 4.61)), and mean heritage language score was higher among those who immigrated after age 12 than before (p = .0001), indicative of convergent validity. Conclusions: This Bicultural Youth Acculturation Questionnaire has demonstrated validity. It can be incorporated into population health surveys to elucidate the impact of acculturation on health outcomes among bicultural youth.

Only recently, however, research has started to directly examine the effect of the intergroup climate on acculturation preferences. In the present research, we aimed to contribute to this new and important line of research by adopting a multilevel approach to examine the effect of the intergroup climate (social context level of analysis) on immigrants’ acculturation preferences (individual level of analysis) over and above individual-level predictors of acculturation preferences. Based on recent cross-sectional survey data from Germany, we examined the acculturation preferences (cultural maintenance and maintenance of intergroup relations) of members of immigrant groups (immigrants from non-Western countries; N individual level = 317) living in different districts in Germany (N district-level = 179). On the social context level, we used the mean prejudice- and acculturation preferences-scores of the German respondents (N = 3,495) as proxies for the intergroup climate within these districts. Results of multilevel path analysis showed that on the context level, a negative intergroup climate (i.e., a higher amount of prejudice of the German respondents within the districts) was related to a stronger desire for cultural maintenance among the immigrants. The potential implications of a hostile intergroup climate for the acculturation process are discussed.},

  Year = {2020},
  Abstract = {Globalization has made it easier for people to migrate, thus increasing diversity within organizations. One problem with this migration is that 1st and 2nd generation immigrants may prefer different leadership styles than those of the mainstream culture. The purpose of this survey-based quantitative comparative study was to investigate the effects of acculturation on the work-related cultural values and leadership style preferences of Mexican immigrants living in the United States. The research question that guided this study focused on the differences in work-related cultural values and preferred leadership styles between 2 generations of Mexican immigrants, Mexicans, and U.S.-born Caucasians. Two hundred and forty-five participants completed the survey. The researcher used a Likert-type self-assessing questionnaire adapted from existing instruments to measure the work-related cultural values and preferred leadership styles of two generations of Mexican immigrants, native Mexicans, and U.S.-born Caucasians. Statistical tools, such as correlations, Cronbach's alpha, t-test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to test measurement reliability and to test for differences in the mean scores of the criterion variables among the 4 groups. The researcher found that, in the aggregate, Mexican immigrants did not acculturate to the mainstream values of the United States, 2nd generation Mexican immigrants' scores were similar to those of U.S.-born Caucasians in work-related values, and all groups prefer the servant leadership style. Implications for social change may include raising the awareness of human resource managers of the differences and similarities in values and preferences of their staff, which may help improve the relationships between managers and the employees.

  Abstract = {PURPOSE. The goal of this article is to present a measurement tool with potential utility for health care workers and mental health professionals who require a means of systematically assessing ethnocultural behaviors in the course of their professional clinical activities and decision making. METHODOLOGY. As part of a larger effort to develop a multi\&shy;dimensional, ethnocultural identification scale for clinical and research use, a cultural general 19 item self\&shy;report behavior index entitled the Ethnocultural Identity Behavior Index (EIBI) was designed. The psychometrics of the EIBI were examined on a sample of 352 college students self\&shy;identifying with an Asian American or Native Hawaiian ethnocultural group. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. The data suggest that the EIBI has high internal consistency. Construct and concurrent convergent validity were also established for the EIBI through a comparison of the EIBI schores of immigrants and non\&shy;immigrants, through correlations with self\&shy;reported strength of identification with one's chosen ethnocultural group (r=0.48), and through correlations with the self\&shy;reports of pride toward one's group (r=0.31). A factor analysis of the EIBI yielded three factors (i.e. Cultural Activities, Social Interactions, Language Opportunities) that accounted for 60\% of the total variance. CONCLUSIONS. The EIBI appears to be a valid and reliable index of one's involvement with an ethnocultural group, making it useful as a quick index of ethnocultural identity.

  Abstract = {Objective: Previous studies have shown that migration and acculturation lead to higher blood pressures and a higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases. Heightened cardiovascular reactivity is considered as a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to examine cardiovascular reactivity in young and healthy second-generation Turkish migrants to Germany. Method: Forty-one Turkish and 20 German male students worked on a mental arithmetic task for 6 min and underwent the cold pressor test for 90 s. Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were taken in intervals of 2 min at baseline and during task periods. Stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), preejection period (PEP), and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were registered continuously by impedance cardiography. The Turkish volunteers were divided into weak and advanced acculturated migrants based on self-ratings given in a questionnaire. Results: Advanced acculturated Turkish students showed greater HR and CO increases and greater PEP and TPR decreases to the mental arithmetic task than Germans or weak acculturated Turkish students. No group differences were found for the cold pressor test. Conclusion: Migrants' acculturation is associated with an enhanced β-adrenergic activation pattern of the sympathetic nervous system that might put them at greater risk with regards to essential hypertension and coronary heart disease. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The authors argue that trust plays an important role in participation levels, but contrary to more traditional models, the causal relationship runs from trust to participation. In addition, the authors posit that trust is strongly affected by economic inequality. Using aggregated American state-level data for the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, the authors present a series of two-stage least squares models on the effects of inequality and trust on participation, controlling for other related factors. Findings indicate that inequality is the strongest determinant of trust and that trust has a greater effect on communal participation than on political participation. © 2005 Sage Publications.},

  Abstract = {The number of Korean immigrants in Manitoba increased significantly in a decade since the introduction of the Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program (PNP). Recent statistics indicate that Manitoba attracted over 13,000 immigrants in 2009, many coming from Korea. The purpose of this research is to understand and measure the integration experiences of Korean immigrants in Manitoba in terms of their social, political, education and employment domains. The primary theory used in this research is social capital. Theories of acculturation, ethnic economy, power and stratification are also used to situate my research. Data was collected using mixed methods comprising a survey of 260 Korean Canadians living in Winnipeg and qualitative interviews with 12 respondents. The analysis shows, among other things, high levels of racism felt by Korean immigrants in Winnipeg. While this perception and daily encounter of discrimination in the community would impede Korean immigrants’ integration into Canada, there also is a strong will to succeed in the community through accessing existing social capital and a willingness to invest in social capital. The contributions made in the development and operationalization of social capital in terms of willingness to invest and social capital mindset are documented. Several program ideas are offered for policy-makers and future research areas have been identified. The development of a political engagement index provides justification for observations made by the social capital theory and immigrant integration literature.},

  Year = {2004},
  Abstract = {This dissertation study examined the relationships between intergenerational conflict and ethnic identity, and the negative outcomes of depression and behavioral problems among Korean American adolescents. The study addressed two distinct aspects of the intergenerational conflict - the indigenous aspect and the acculturation aspect. The indigenous aspect referred to the typical intergenerational conflict experienced by American adolescents due to their phase of development. The acculturation aspect examined unique manifestations of conflict related to the acculturation process of immigrant families. This dissertation study attempted to provide a better understanding of how these two specific aspects of intergenerational conflict contribute to depression and behavioral problems among Korean American adolescents. No scale that measured the acculuturation aspect of intergenerational conflict exsited. Thus, a new scale was developed to investigate this unique aspect. The study also investigated the effects of ethnic identity on these problems as a predictor and moderator. The study aimed to assess: (a) the relationship between intergenerational conflict (as affected by the adolescent developmental process and the acculturation process combined, and by each of these processes separately) and depression and behavioral problems; (b) the relationship between intergenerational conflict and ethnic identity; (c) the relationship between ethnic identity and depression and behavioral problems; and (d) the relationship between intergenerational conflict and depression and behavioral problems as moderated by ethnic identity. The study design was cross-sectional, and employed a convenience sampling method. The study participants were Korean American adolescents of junior and senior high school age, 14 to18 years old. The study included a pilot study, administered at two Korean churches in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to clarify any ambiguities or misunderstanding from the questionnaire and to psychometrically evaluate a new scale developed to measure acculturative conflict. The primary study was conducted at eleven Korean churches and one hakwon (private out-of-school studies institute) in Fairfax County, Virginia. The results indicated that two distinct aspects of intergenerational conflict and ethnic identity are important in understanding depression and behavioral problems among Korean American adolescents. This study contributed to our understanding of Korean youth as follow. First, it presented a new scale which measures a unique cultural aspect of intergenerational conflict among Korean American families. Second, the study demonstrated that acculturative conflict had a greater impact on depression and behavioral problems, compared to developmental conflict. Finally, the study provided evidence that ethnic identity moderated the effect of intergenerational conflict on depression. In addition, the results of this study suggest the need for further research in the area of ethnic identity and its unique relationship to psychosocial factors.},

  Abstract = {This article examines relations between social integration into host societies, religio-ethnic acculturation into group belonging, and ties to home country among Israeli émigrés in the United States and Europe. I use data from a 2009-2010 Internet survey into which I incorporated country-contextual characteristics. The results of multivariate analyses show that a social integration combining duration of residence abroad and local citizenship enhances religio-ethnic identification. Another measure of integration, social networks, deters group behaviors. All measures of general integration inhibit attachment to the home country, whereas religio-ethnic acculturation is largely insignificant for transnationalism. The religiosity of the new country does not influence immigrants' religio-ethnic patterns or homeland attachment. Insofar as group size is a significant determinant of particularistic behaviors, it weakens them. The more policy-based opportunities newcomers receive, the more they dissociate from group behaviors and homeland ties. Irrespective of individual and contextual factors, living in the United States encourages group affiliation more than living in Europe does. The results are discussed in reference to four working hypotheses-marginalization, integration, assimilation, and separation-and from a U.S.-European comparative perspective.},

Two studies were conducted to describe the development of the MASPAD and to assess its psychometric properties. Data were collected from 367 African American participants in Atlanta, GA; Columbus, OH; Los Angeles; and New York City, NY. The MASPAD consistently produced scores with adequate reliability and independent raters provided initial evidence for face and content validity. Pearson correlation coefficients supported the purported orthogonality of the MASPAD subscales. The MASPAD was found to be a significant predictor of cultural worldview and values. The bidimensional model of acculturation theorized to exist in the MASPAD was supported with a confirmatory factor analysis on data collected from 831 participants.

  Abstract = {Building upon existing measures, four new brief acculturation scales are presented, measuring sociocultural adaptation, psychological adaptation, perceived cultural distance, and acculturation orientation. Following good scale reliability in initial samples, the English scales were translated into nine different languages (Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, Thai, and Turkish). The translated scales were administered to a large sample of sojourners (N = 1,929), demonstrating good reliability and adequate structural equivalence across languages. In line with existing theory, sociocultural adaptation and psychological adaptation were positively correlated, and showed a negative association with perceived cultural distance. General measures of well-being were correlated with adaptation and distance, with better adaptation relating to higher well-being, and more distance relating to lower well-being. Acculturation orientation toward the home and host culture were measured separately and a weak negative correlation was found between the two, supporting their independence. Arguing against dichotomization, these subscales were analyzed as continuous variables. Regression analysis showed sojourners to be better adapted, if they were oriented more toward the host culture and less toward the home culture. These new scales are proposed as alternatives to existing measures. © The Author(s) 2013.},

Previous literature tends to highlight the sufferings and difficulties that female refugees experience as they leave their homelands and settle in a new country. Few studies have been directed toward the political dimension of refugee life. The empirical results show that North Korean women defectors hold generally participatory attitudes toward politics and mostly liberal opinions on policy issues. Furthermore, among the socio-demographic variables, age and marital status are generally influential in the intention of political participation among the North Korean women defectors. Among the political attitudinal variables, attitude toward environmental policy consistently affects political participation intention. With respect to defector-specific variables, satisfaction with life in South Korea is influential, whereas cultural adaptation is not.},

  Abstract = {There is a lack of acculturation research on the motivations underpinning the behaviors of immigrants, which influence how they adapt in their new country of residence. The authors suggest that Motivation for Cultural Maintenance (MCM) and Motivation for Cultural Exploration (MCE) influence acculturation behaviors of immigrants and that these acculturation behaviors, in turn, impact psychological and sociocultural adaptation. The present research investigates a dual-process model based on the relationships between these novel motivations, acculturation behavior of connections with ethnic/national peers, and psychological and sociocultural adaptation in a New Zealand immigrant sample (N = 280, 64.6\% female, M age = 39 years). Results from structural equation modeling largely support the proposed dual-process model and demonstrate that the novel motivations have predictive power. MCM predicted psychological adaptation through ethnic peer connections, whereas MCE and national peer connections predicted sociocultural adaptation directly. Implications of the findings and how the proposed dual-process model can contribute to the acculturation literature are discussed.},

  Abstract = {The concept of . acculturation attitudes refers to the various ways that acculturating individuals prefer to live with the two cultures that they are in contact with. In the original acculturation attitudes framework, Berry proposed a two-dimensional structure. The two dimensions were: to what extent do acculturating individuals prefer to maintain their heritage culture and identity; and to what extent do people wish to have contact with others outside their own group, and participate in the larger society. When these two dimensions are crossed, four ways of acculturating can be distinguished: assimilation, integration, separation, marginalisation. The first goal of this paper is to use other ways of operationalising these two dimensions to discover the resultant variations in the classification of individuals into the four ways of acculturating. The second goal is to see whether these variations in classifying ways of acculturation lead to different relationships with immigrants' psychological wellbeing. We examine both questions using data from immigrant youth in Montreal and Paris, and conclude that different operationalisations of these two dimensions do yield some important variations in classification. There are also variations across these ways of assessing acculturation attitudes in their relationships with the psychological wellbeing of immigrant youth. Moreover, these variations are amplified when taking into account the society into which immigrant youth have settled. The general conclusions are that it does matter how and where acculturation attitudes are assessed, and that these variations impact the degree of psychological adaptation of immigrant youth. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  Abstract = {Purpose: The extent to which immigrant-specific factors influence the intergenerational transmission of family violence is unknown. The objectives of this paper are to examine the associations between immigrant generational status (IGS), child maltreatment (CM), intimate partner violence (IPV) and acculturation (i.e., the extent to which an individual adopts the values, language and attitudes of a new culture). Methods: The sample was drawn from wave two of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC; n = 34,653), a nationally representative survey of United States (US) residents aged 20 years and older. Logistic regression was used to estimate the associations between IGS, CM history, IPV, and acculturation. Results: Compared to 3rd generation (or later) respondents, 1st generation immigrants were less likely to report a history of sexual (AOR = 0.74, CI0.95 = 0.62, 0.90) and emotional abuse (AOR = 0.69, CI0.95 = 0.55, 0.87), but were more likely to report physical neglect (AOR = 1.30, CI0.95 = 1.11, 1.52). After adjusting for covariates, IGS was not associated with IPV among respondents with or without a CM history. Among those without a CM history, highly acculturated 1st generation immigrants (AOR = 1.07, CI0.95 = 1.01, 1.13) were more likely to report perpetrating IPV, with highly acculturated 3rd generation respondents having lower odds of reporting IPV perpetration (AOR = 0.93, CI0.95 = 0.88–1.00). Conclusion: IGS and acculturation are important factors in CM and IPV. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the influence of IGS, recency of immigration, acculturation and acculturative stress on the experiences and relationship between CM and IPV.

Using two separate immigrant populations - one of former Middle-Eastern residents now living in the U.S. and the other of Asian immigrants in the U.S. - results indicate that those who want to keep their original culture are less tolerant of unethical consumer activities, while those who are more willing to adopt the host culture are more tolerant of these same consumer activities. Furthermore, the immigrants in both studies who are more tolerant of unethical consumer activities are those who are generally somewhat younger and with less formal education.

  Abstract = {As part of the Taiwan Aboriginal Study Project (TASP), a new acculturation scale (the Taiwan Aboriginal Acculturation Scale, or TAAS) has been developed among the aboriginal minorities of Austronesian origin in Taiwan. The design of the original 54 items was based on Milton Gordon's concept of assimilation in association with a careful consideration of cross-cultural validity. These items were administered to 144 subjects stratified by age and sex who were randomly sampled from four major Taiwanese aboriginal groups. Item analysis and factor analysis were applied to select an 18-item scale which has three subscales (factors): cultural assimilation, social assimilation, and social attitude. Results of validity and reliability studies of the TAAS were found to be acceptable. The development of TAAS demonstrates the applicability of the concept of acculturation as a process that involves changes both in attitude, and in behaviour, to nonwestern societies. © 1995, Cambridge University Press.

  Abstract = {The Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans (ARSMA) was revised for the purpose of developing an instrument that assessed acculturation processes through an orthogonal, multidimensional approach by measuring cultural orientation toward the Mexican culture and the Anglo culture independently. Two subscales, Anglo Orientation Subcale (AOS) and Mexican Orientation Subscale (MOS), were developed from items from the original ARSMA scale. The two cultural orientation subscales were found to have good internal reliabilities (Cronbach's Alpha = 86 and 88 for the AOS and the MOS, respectively. The revised scale (ARSMA-JJ) yielded a high Pearson correlation coefficient (r = 89) with the original scale. Strong construct validity of ARSMA -II was demonstrated using a sample of 379 individuals representing generations I to 5. ARSMA-II is multifactorial and capable of generating multidimensional acculturative types, for example, integrated, separated, assimilated and marginalized. © 1995, SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD.

Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicate that within each cultural dimension (AAMAS-Culture of Origin, AAMAS-Asian American, and AAMAS-European American) there are 4 reliable acculturation domains of cultural identity, language, cultural knowledge, and food consumption. These features of the AAMAS allow for a more complex assessment of acculturation level of Asian Americans and its relationship to psychological functioning.},

  Abstract = {This study explores how acculturation is related to adaptation across different life spheres for 162 Soviet Jewish refugee adolescents in a suburban community in Maryland. Because the different contexts of refugee adolescents' lives vary in acculturative demands, different patterns of acculturation should be related to adaptation in different life spheres. The study uses a multidimensional measure of acculturation and assesses acculturation to both American and Russian cultures as it relates to psychological adaptation, peer relations, and school and family outcomes. Findings support the general ecological thesis that acculturation to different cultures is differentially related to adaptation across life domains. Acculturation to American culture predicted better grades and perceived support from American peers. Acculturation to Russian culture predicted perceived support from Russian peers. Both American acculturation and Russian acculturation predicted reduced loneliness and perceived support from parents. Further, different dimensions of acculturation, such as language and identity, were differentially related to adaptation. Implications for acculturation theory and measurement are drawn, and cautions are offered about the interpretation of acculturation studies using single proxies such as language use or preference.},

  Abstract = {The research examined host national and co-national identification in relation to sociocultural and psychological adaptation during cross-cultural transition. Ninety-eight sojourners (employees of a New Zealand organization and their spouses) completed questionnaires that included measurements of acculturation (host and co-national identification), social difficulty, and depression. Host and co-national identity scores were subjected to a median split, and 2 2 analyses of variance were performed; in this case, the interaction term represented four acculturation strategies: integration, separation, assimiliation, and marginalisation. Results revealed two main effects. Subjects with strong host national identification experienced less sociocultural adjustment difficulties (p {\textless} .001), whereas those with strong co-national identification evinced less psychological adjustment problems (p {\textless} .001). Interaction effects were also observed. For sociocultural adaptation (p {\textless} .05), the greatest amount of social difficulty was experienced by respondents who endorsed a separatist position, the least by assimilated and integrated subjects, and an intermediate level by the marginalized. For psychological adjustment (p {\textless} .04), integrated subjects experienced less depression than assimilated ones; however, there were no other significant differences among the four groups. The findings are discussed with reference to the quadri-modal model of acculturation attitudes and the conceptual distinction of psychological and sociocultural adjustment during cross-cultural transition.},

Differences in BII, acculturation stress, and bicultural competence were measured with new instruments developed for the purposes of the study. Using a sample of Chinese American biculturals, we found that variations in BII do not define a uniform phenomenon, as commonly implied in the literature, but instead encompass two separate independent constructs: perceptions of distance (vs. overlap) and perceptions of conflict (vs. harmony) between one's two cultural identities or orientations. Results also indicated that cultural conflict and cultural distance have distinct personality, acculturation, and sociodemographic antecedents. © Blackwell Publishing 2005.},

Results indicated that, as expected, involvement in the U.S. culture predicted positive functioning across all three adjustment domains, and involvement in the Vietnamese culture predicted positive family relationships. Contrary to hypotheses, involvement in the Vietnamese culture related negatively to personal adjustment (i.e., distress). These findings are discussed in terms of the apparent complexities of the acculturation-adjustment link, particularly with regard to the utility of viewing acculturation from a two-dimensional framework and the need to consider the type of adjustment indices examined and the social contexts in which ethnic groups reside.},

They executed preliminary exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) and subsequent confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) separately for each ethnic group. Results suggest much similarity between the measurement models of each group. The CFAs also indicate that the two language-based dimensions are the most reliable indicators of ethnic identity for both ethnic groups. One multisample analysis points to potentially invariant measurement structures between the two groups and another is indicative of stability of the proposed general structure between men and women. Estimates from additional second-order confirmatory factor analysis models, which also include acculturation, serve to demonstrate that the ethnic identity construct is discriminant of acculturation for both groups. Structural equation modeling shows that ethnic identity dimensions tend to be positively related to the consumption of traditional foods for both Greek- and Italian-Canadians. On the other hand, the hypothesis that ethnic identity is negatively related to the consumption of convenience foods received only partial confirmation. This was reflected by the Italian-Canadian sample but not by its Greek-Canadian counterpart. © ASAC 2005.},

Involvements in the host society culture and the culture of origin should be assessed separately in order to reflect the complexities of the cultural interactions immigrants and their offspring experience. To evaluate this prescription, we convened focus groups of Puerto Rican adults to discuss their cultural experiences in Puerto Rico and in the United States. Discussions were content analyzed to develop acculturation items. Factor analysis of the responses of 403 first- and second-generation adults yielded two general factors, involvement in American culture and involvement in Puerto Rican culture, which demonstrated modest reliability, relative independence, and moderate correlations with traditional acculturation scale validators. Results of the study challenge the assumption of mutual cultural exclusivity in acculturative change; enable the measurement of degree of biculturality; and provide future directions for the assessment of acculturation in domains other than language usage. The concept of acculturation is integrated with recent formulations in community psychology which advocate a deeper and more extensive commitment to studying the implications of cultural phenomena and greater focus on the growing cultural diversity in the United States. © 1994 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

  Abstract = {With the growth of immigrant populations and the increasing awareness and appreciation for the cultural diversity in the U.S., the present study assessed a model of acculturation with a sample of Korean American older adults. We addressed a bidimensional model of acculturation, considering both orientations toward home and host cultures, and assessed the relevance of Berry's four-cell typology of acculturation (integration, assimilation, separation, and marginalization). Based on the unique characteristics of the present sample, including that they were all born in Korea and had been exposed to their home culture for a substantial amount of time, we hypothesized that their orientation towards original culture would be strong and that simple application of Berry's four-cell typology would not be relevant. As expected, scores on Korean orientation were distributed toward the high end of the scale, suggesting a high level of familiarity and adherence to the original culture; scores on American orientation were correspondingly low. Cluster analysis showed that a two-cluster model was an optimal group classification in the sample used in this investigation. The groups were identified as "integrated group" and "separated group." Compared to the separated group, integrated group was more likely to be younger, married, and educated. More years of residence in the U.S. and better physical and mental health were observed among those who were integrated. The findings call attention to the needs to consider the unique nature of immigrant samples in order to adequately apply the acculturation typologies. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The CFAs indicated that the ASVA's two-factor and four-factor structures achieved an excellent fit to the data and furthermore, that a bidimensional, two-factor model was superior to a unidimensional, bipolar one predominantly used in acculturation scales today. As such, this study demonstrated the utility of viewing acculturation from a two-dimensional framework; it also provided researchers a practical, 2D scale to use.},

  Abstract = {The research employed a new and recently developed instrument to examine the two dimensions (host and co-national identification) and four modes (integration, separation, marginalization, and assimilation) of acculturation and their relationship to sojourner adjustment. International aid workers in Nepal completed a questionnaire including the Acculturation Index and the assessments of psychological and sociocultural adjustment. Analyses revealed that strong co-national identification predicted enhanced psychological well-being, whereas strong host national identification was associated with better sociocultural adaptation. Acculturation styles were also related to adjustive outcomes. Sojourners who adopted an integrated style fared better psychologically than others, whereas those who assumed an assimilationist perspective experienced fewer social difficulties. The article highlights methodological issues pertaining to the measurement of acculturation and discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the use of categorical versus continuous data and mean comparisons versus correlational techniques in the analysis of the relationship among identification, acculturation, and sojourner adjustment.},

  Abstract = {A paper-and-pencil measure of acculturation for Chicano adolescents was developed using multiple regression techniques and 924 Chicano and Anglo high school students in three Southern California communities. A linear combination of sociocultural and semantic diffèrential variables provided for optimal discrimination between Chicanos and Anglos. The acculturation score for an individual was defined as the linear combination of semantic and sociocultural variables which provided the best least squares estimate of that individual's score on a dichotomous variable in which Chicanos were assigned a value of 0 and Anglos a value of 1. A double cross-validation procedure indicated that the 20-variable regression equation is reasonably stable from the first sample to the next, yielding validity coefficients from .66 to .80. An ancillary study of 129 Chicano and Anglo junior college students showed scores are stable 2 or 3 wk.; test-retest reliability ranged from .66 to .89. A factor analysis of the items included in the regression equation resulted in three factors; two were slightly intercorrelated and loaded primarily with sociocultural variables pertaining to language spoken at home, nationality, and socioeconomic status of the head of household. The third factor was essentially orthogonal to the other two and showed high loadings for semantic differential scales for concepts, “mother,” “father,” and “male” on the Potency dimension. Chicanos vary widely along the derived acculturation continuum. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed with respect to educational and psychological assessment.},

  Abstract = {Enculturation is the process by which individuals learn about and identify with their ethnic minority culture. It is distinguished from acculturation which refers to the process by which an ethnic minority individual is assimilated into the majority culture. Three studies with Native American youths are reported that describe the development of a measure of enculturation for Native American youths. Development of a measure of enculturation provides a foundation upon which to build a body of literature that focuses on strengths in a youth's life rather than on deficits. Results of the first study (n = 120), a confirmatory factor analysis, indicated that cultural affinity, Native American identity, and family involvement in traditional activities adequately represent the construct of enculturation. The study also provides some convergent validity for this interpretation. The second study examines factor invariance for enculturation among youths with data from over 2 years (n = 69). The factor structure was similar across time. The third study replicates the factor structure and validity analyses with a new sample (n = 42). Usefulness of the measure for assessing protective factors and stressing ethnicity over simple assessment of race categories is discussed.},

  Abstract = {Background. This investigation is part of a wider research project on the acculturation and identity-related issues of South Asian young people in Britain, Canada and the US. There has been no published research on the acculturation of this ethnic group in Australia. The project is embedded within Berry's (1994) theoretical framework of acculturation. Aims. There are two major aims of the research. Firstly, to discover any pattern of acculturation of South Asian young people and to compare it with that of their counterparts in Britain and Canada. Secondly, to validate the existing Acculturation Scale (Ghuman, 1975, 1997, 1999a) with a group of South Asian young people living in a different socio-political context. Samples. The sample was drawn from three high schools - two being in Newcastle City, and one in a rural setting of New South Wales, Australia. A representative sample of 75 boys and girls (aged 14 to 16) from two social class backgrounds took part in the research. Methods. The young people were requested to fill in a background questionnaire on their religion, languages spoken at home, best friend, frequency of visit to a temple, etc. They also completed the Aberystwyth Likert-type Acculturation Scale. Results. Summated scores on the scale of two social class groups confirmed the previous finding that a non-manual group shows a higher degree of acculturation compared with a manual group. But, contrary to expectations, girls show lower acculturation than boys. The Spearman-Brown coefficient of reliability is 0.82 - which is in line with the findings in England and Canada. Conclusions. The whole sample shows a lower degree of acculturation compared with their counterparts in Canada and England. This is fully contextualised: viz, at the time of research (March 1998) the socio-political of Australia was anti-Asian, due mainly to the impending general election in which immigration from Asia was a significant issue. The mean score of the sample reflects their bilingualism and biculturalism.},

  Abstract = {The relations among behavioral measures of acculturation and five cultural constructs were explored in a sample of 379 persons varying across five generation levels. The sample was mostly (89\%) of Mexican origin. The Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans‐II (ARSMA‐II) was used as the measure of acculturation. The development of five scales measuring the cultural constructs of Familism, Fatalism, Machismo, Personalismo, and Folk Beliefs is reported. Significant relations were found among four of the five constructs with generational status and acculturation. The findings support Acculturation Theory, which postulates that psychological acculturation takes place at least along cognitive and behavioral domains. The findings demonstrate that cultural attitudes, ideas, beliefs, and values associated with the acculturation processes can be reliably measured and that these processes have empirical construct validity. Familism, Fatalism, Machismo, and Folk Beliefs were found to be negatively correlated with acculturation (Pearson's r = −.23, p {\textless}.001) for Familism; r = −.19, p {\textless}.05 for Fatalism; r = −.24, p {\textless}.001 for Machismo; r = −.32, p {\textless}.001 for Folk Beliefs. The findings are discussed with regard to understanding cultural differences within the Mexican‐American population, and the role that such factors may have in the experience of illness, help‐seeking behaviors, and in the provision of culturally competent mental health services.

  Abstract = {Objectives. To examine the associations of socioeconomic status and acculturation with obesity and lifestyle characteristics that may be risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease among low-income Puerto Rican women. Methods. This cross-sectional study was conducted between 1998 and 1999 by interviewing a convenience sample of 200 low-income Puerto Rican female caretakers of young children in Hartford, Connecticut, United States of America. Various recruitment methods were used to ensure adequate representation of the target community. The associations of obesity (body mass index ≥ 30.0) and lifestyle factors (physical activity, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, food intake) with socioeconomic status (education, employment, car ownership), acculturation, age, and marital status were examined with Spearman rho, chi-squared, and Mann-Whitney U tests and logistic regression analyses. Results. Mean age was 29 years. Obesity (40\%), physical inactivity (47\%), and cigarette smoking (32\%) were common. Less acculturated participants were 57\% less likely to smoke and 54\% less likely to be obese than their more acculturated counterparts. Lower socioeconomic status (not finishing high school or not owning a car) was associated with a higher likelihood of obesity, but unemployed (vs. employed) women were less likely to be obese (P {\textless} 0.05). Women who did not own a car consumed meat, eggs and fish less often than those who owned a car. Smokers were more likely to have an unhealthy food intake pattern than nonsmokers. Conclusions. The associations of acculturation and socioeconomic status with some lifestyle characteristics suggest the need for culturally appropriate programs to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors in this low-income community.},

Results indicated that the internal consistency and test-retest reliabilities were adequate. Discriminant validity was demonstrated by differences shown between 1st and 2nd-generation South Asian women. Convergent validity was demonstrated by a positive relationship between the CVCS and measures of anxiety and cultural adjustment difficulties. Finally, it appears that social desirability plays a role in the self-representation of this group of South Asian women.},

Three of the subscales were correlated with the subscales of a modified Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican-Americans-II, with English language usage, and with generation in the United States providing evidence for the validity of the scale.

  Abstract = {The Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican-Americans (ARSMA) of Cuellar, Harris, and Jasso (1980) is a widely used instrument of high reliability. Attempts to refine and validate the measure have been limited largely to factor analytic techniques. Typically three to four orthogonal factors are extracted from this measure. However, these factors usually are ignored in practice, and a single summed acculturation score is calculated across all items. The present research illustrates the dangers of factoring scales of extremely high internal consistency, and suggests an alternative. This alternative, applied to the responses of 790 Hispanic Americans, successfully reduces the ARSMA by half while maintaining its high internal consistency. The reduced measure is clearly single factored, strongly relates to the full scale, and replicates earlier results. The results of this scale construction/ refinement suggest a strong link between communication and acculturation.},

Using 24-hour dietary recall data from the continuous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey pooled across multiple years from 1999/00 through 2009/10, we developed and tested the validity of the “Food Similarity Index” (FSI), which indicates the similarity of the foods consumed by individuals to the foods most commonly consumed by same-aged U.S-born persons of all racial/ethnic groups. We demonstrate its utility here for children and adults of four racial-ethnic groups. FSI was positively associated with the consumption of common American foods and negatively associated with eating Hispanic and Asian foods. In addition, FSI was associated with generational status among all racial/ethnic groups and duration of U.S. residence among Hispanics. FSI was also negatively associated with the Healthy Eating Index 2010. The FSI enables researchers to compare immigrants’ dietary patterns over generations and across groups. It can be used to study how dietary acculturation shapes health risk factors and diseases.},

The present study measured the psychometric properties of the MASPAD among Nigerian immigrants in the UK. Principal component analysis revealed that all variables loaded substantially across six components for acculturation patterns and religious factors, which are: 'traditionalist behaviours', 'traditionalist beliefs', 'assimilationist behaviours', 'integrationist behaviours', 'religious beliefs', and 'religious behaviours'. Two new distinct subscales emerged from the adapted MASPAD for assessing religious beliefs and behaviours, which is characteristic of a multidimensional factor structure for acculturation scales. This study has provided important information on the need to develop appropriate measures for people of African descent, relative to their historical and cultural antecedents, as well as immigration contexts.

  Abstract = {This study examined the psychometric properties of the Social Connectedness in Mainstream Society (SCMN) and the Social Connectedness in the Ethnic Community (SCETH) Scales in two groups of ethnic minorities. We especially examined their theoretical/conceptual and empirical viability in relation to other established constructs of general social connectedness, acculturation, and enculturation. Analyses of two sets of survey data from 200 Mexican American students in California and 134 Asian international students in Minnesota supported (a) construct validity of the SCMN and the SCETH as related but distinct structures, (b) convergent and discriminant validity in relation to acculturation and enculturation, and (c) high reliability. The examination of incremental validity in predicting subjective well-being further supported their distinctive utility in addition to other established constructs of general social connectedness, acculturation, enculturation, ethnic identity, and other group orientation. Implications for future research and practice are discussed. © 2012 American Psychological Association.},

  Abstract = {Previous studies on social integration of immigrants were predominantly of static nature. This article provides a dynamic account by distinguishing differences in social integration that develop shortly after immigrants’ arrival in the host country from changes with length of stay. We examine contacts in leisure time between natives and non-western immigrants in the Netherlands. Theories from research on ethnic intermarriage are applied to these more common forms of contact. We use pooled cross-sectional survey data from 1988–2002. The results show that on average social integration increases with length of stay. Ethnicity, migration motive and home country education account for differences in integration that develop shortly after arrival and are maintained or even increased with length of stay, while the size of the immigrant group matters mainly at entry and then loses its influence over time. Age at migration exclusively explains differences in social integration that develop with length of stay. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Latent class analysis provides one useful approach to understanding the diversity in sample of Mexican immigrants (N = 238). Based on 13 linguistic, psychological and behavioral indicators for acculturation, four discrete subgroups were characterized: (1) Less acculturated, (2) Moderately acculturated, (3) Highly acculturated, (4) Selectively bicultural. A Chi-square test revealed that three sub-groups were significantly different in language preference when seeking health information. Less acculturated and moderately acculturated groups sought health information in Spanish, whereas the highly acculturated group preferred English for health information. Selectively bicultural group preferred bilingual health information. Implications for health campaign strategies using audience segmentation are discussed.},

In the original article, the figure on page 141, the two predictors 'majority group contact' and 'minority group contact' are incorrectly switched. The corrected figure is given in the erratum.] Against the background of contrasting religious versus secular norms in immigrant communities and in Dutch society, this study examines how religious identity expression is related to the social integration of Dutch Muslims within (a) Turkish or Moroccan minority groups and (b) Dutch majority groups. Using nationally representative survey data (N = 2,027), we distinguish religious identification from religious practice (worship and dietary practices) and assertion (support for the role of religion in politics and society) as different forms of religious expression. Structural equation models confirm that minority group contact supports and, conversely, majority group contact suppresses religious practice and assertion. In line with religion as social identity, this result is partly because Dutch Muslims with more minority contacts identify more strongly with their religion, whereas those with more majority contacts identify less strongly. As found in a social capital approach, social integration also directly influences religious expression, especially within the most cohesive Turkish minority group.

  Abstract = {Background: Studies have shown that social integration may have a positive as well as a negative effect on the mental health of immigrants, depending on the social circumstances. Aims of the study: To investigate the relationship between social integration and psychological distress in immigrants in Oslo, Norway, with focus on gender differences. Methods: The study was based on data from a community survey in Oslo (N = 15899), and included 1448 immigrants from non-Western and 1059 immigrants from Western countries. Psychological distress was measured by a 10 items version of Hopkins Symptom Check List (HSCL-10), and social integration was measured by an index based on four items: Knowledge of the Norwegian language, reading Norwegian newspapers, visits by Norwegians and receiving help from Norwegians. Information on paid employment, household income, marital status, social support and conflicts in intimate relationships was also included in the study. Results: The non-western immigrants showed a higher level of psychological distress than the immigrants from western countries. In men this could be explained by the combination of less social integration, less employment, lower income, less social support and more conflicts in intimate relationships among non-western compared to western immigrants. In women the difference in level of psychological stress could not be explained by these variables, even if it was reduced. A reason for this seemed to be that social integration in non-western immigrants had a different effect on mental health in men and women. In men, social integration showed a positive effect through employment and income, as well as a positive effect in other areas. Also in non-western women social integration showed a positive effect through greater access to employment and income, but this effect was levelled out by integration causing problems in other areas. Conclusion: Unexpectedly, social integration in non-western immigrants was associated with good mental health in men, but not in women. A possible explanation for this might be that the traditional female role in these countries is more challenged by social integration into a Western country than the male role, resulting in conflicting norms, threat to the self and/or loss of identity. © 2007 Dalgard and Thapa; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

In Study 1, surveys were administered to 56 participants to refine the scale. In Study 2, psychometric evaluation of cross-sectional data with 344 participants showed high reliability and validity. Exploratory factor analysis generated a three-factor explanation, which aligned with the hypothesized conceptual framework: ambiguous loss of homeland, satisfaction with the homeland, and satisfaction with the United States. A single scale, relative satisfaction was created by taking the difference between the two satisfaction factors. The PALH can be useful in understanding individuals’ psychological challenges with leaving their homeland and adjusting to life in a new country.},

  Abstract = {The study examined the relationship between migration and the incidence of emotional disorders among 568 young Third World immigrants in Norway. Participants were 10–17 years of age. Using a questionnaire, acculturative stress (i.e., change in health status as a result of acculturation) was found to exist among the children, although having to migrate or being born in Norway was not related to mental health status. A stressful acculturative experience (i.e., difficulties in initiating friendship with Norwegian peers) alone could account for only 1\% of the self reported emotional disorders. Incidence of depressive tendencies, poor self image, and psychological and somatic symptoms were found to be related to close and supportive parents, marginality, integration, gender and the number of friends the child had. These accounted for between 12 and 15\% of the explained variance. The paper theoretically discusses how these factors may be related to acculturative stress, and recommends them as starting points for a primary intervention program to reduce emotional disorders among these children.

Both an exploratory factor analysis and a Linear Logistic Test Model analysis provided evidence for the bipolar unidimensionality of Berry's four acculturation strategies; integration constituted one pole and assimilation, separation, and marginalization the other. Integration was by far the most popular strategy. Cognitive performance was measured by the Snijders-Oomen Nonverbal Intelligence Test, school report measures, and a computer-assisted choice reaction-time measure. A good fit was found for a structural model that postulated cognitive acculturation as the latent variable linking background measures (i.e. acculturation strategy, second language usage, age, and gender) to the cognitive measures. Relationships between background variables and cognitive performance were stronger in the first than in the second generation. Both older children and children who favour an integration strategy showed a higher degree of cognitive acculturation.},

Finally, in Studies 4 and 5, the authors found that need for cognitive closure (or the need for firm answers) and existential terror significantly attenuated the positive link between multicultural experiences and receptiveness to ideas originated from foreign cultures.

  Abstract = {As Australia is one of the most multicultural societies in the world, acculturation of migrants and changes in migrants' health status should be an important focus of public health research. The absence of an accepted measure of acculturation is one barrier to exploring the relationship between acculturation and health. This paper presents data from a study of 851 Arabic-speaking adults attending 20 Arabic-speaking general practitioners in Canterbury, Sydney. An eight-item scale assessing acculturation was developed with a structural equation modelling program (LISREL). This acculturation scale was based on similar scales used with Hispanic populations, was theoretically grounded and had high internal consistency and criterion-related validity. To show the application of a scale of acculturation, patients' preferences for participation in medical decision making, according to level of acculturation, were examined. After adjustment for age, sex and highest level of formal education, significant inverse associations between acculturation and preferences for patient (versus family) involvement in medical decision making were found. Mechanisms for how acculturation affects health need to be explored.},

  Abstract = {Bicultural Identity Integration (BII) is an individual difference construct that captures variations in the experience of biculturalism. Using multiple samples in a series of steps, we refined BII measurement and then tested the construct in a diverse sample of bicultural individuals. Specifically, we wrote new BII items based on qualitative data (n = 108), examined the quality of the new measure using subject-matter experts (n = 23) and bicultural individuals (n = 5), and then collected validation data from bicultural college students (n = 1049). We used exploratory factor analyses to select items and explore BIIS-2 structure with a random subset of the larger sample (n = 600), confirmatory factor analyses to show that the factor structure fit the data well (n = 449), and multigroup confirmatory factor analyses to demonstrate measurement invariance in two ethnic and two generational groups. Results showed that the Bicultural Identity Integration Scale-Version 2 (BIIS-2) yielded reliable and stable scores. The data also revealed interesting and important patterns of associations with theoretically relevant constructs: Personality, acculturation, and psychological well-being. Additionally, structural equation models confirmed that in general, personality and acculturation variables influence individuals' experiences with their dual cultural identities, which in turn influence adjustment, but there were interesting and important generational differences in how these variables were related. These findings lend support for the validity of BIIS-2 score interpretations; add to our understanding of the sociocultural, personality, and adjustment correlates of the bicultural experience; and have important implications for understanding the well-being of bicultural individuals.},

Principal-components analyses yielded 4 stable and internally consistent factors: Spanish Competency Pressures (7 items), English Competency Pressures (7 items), Pressure to Acculturate (7 items), and Pressure Against Acculturation (4 items). These 4 factors accounted for 64.4\% of the variance and correlated in the expected directions with criterion measures of acculturation and/or psychological adjustment. Further reliability and validity testing of the MASI is discussed as well as the utility of this measure in assessing acculturative stress among adults of Mexican origin.},

Second, the most commonly listed beliefs and practices identified by the judges were included in a pilot inventory. Here, three Greek-American judges rated the accuracy of items as measures of Greek-American acculturation. Third, a 44-item revised inventory of items that had the highest mean ratings (content validation) showed good construct and concurrent validity among Greek-Americans.},

The ISI-CT incorporates five distinct identity styles (analytical informational, exploratory informational, normative to the country of origin, normative to the host society, and diffuse-avoidant) and a measure of immigrant identity commitment. The article reports the construction of the ISI-CT and examines its factorial structure (Studies 1 and 2), convergent and discriminant validity (Study 1), and longitudinal relationships among subscales (Study 3). Relationships between demographic variables, including age, gender, length of stay, language proficiency, and cultural background, and the ISI-CT subscales are also investigated. Findings support reliability and validity of the ISI-CT as an assessment of the identity processes underlying identity development of people in cultural transition. The potential of this new measurement and construct to contribute to the understanding of the immigrant experience and the wider field of acculturation research is discussed.},

Relative Acculturation Extended Model: New contributions with regard to the study of acculturation. International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 29, 21-37], is used for this. This model differentiates between the real and ideal planes of acculturation, that is, between the strategies that are actually put into practice and attitudes that are preferred. Moreover, the model distinguishes seven spheres, or domains, of acculturation (political, work, economic, social, family, religious and ways of thinking), in which persons (immigrants and natives) adopt and prefer different acculturation options (strategies and attitudes). About 1523 persons (397 Maghrebis, 434 Sub-Saharans, 398 Spaniards who evaluated the Maghreb exogroup and 385 Spaniards who evaluated the Sub-Saharan exogroup), answered a questionnaire made expressly for the study. According to our predictions, immigrants and natives coincide in their choices for acculturation ("assimilation") in the peripheral domains of the RAEM (work, economic); they also coincide in their acculturation attitudes in the social domain ("integration"); however, they differ enormously in the options preferred for the central spheres, or hard core, of the culture (e.g., family, religious, ways of thinking): While immigrants prefer "separation", natives continue to prefer "assimilation". Advantages of the RAEM division into domains of acculturation are discussed with regard to previous models, as well as the implications for predicting inter-group conflict. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The results from the two studies showed that the SWMLS has favorable psychometric characteristics. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of the SWMLS resulted in a unidimensional factor structure. Cronbach's α was excellent. Evidence of validity was also found between scores on the SWMLS and other indicators of well-being and acculturation. The findings suggested a brief and viable tool to assess satisfaction with migration life. Potential uses of the scale for research are discussed.},

It was expected that integration would lead to the best outcome for both groups. Moreover, it was tested whether the relative 'fit' between host society and immigrant strategy preference would predict intergroup relations. The predictive power of two different operationalisations of fit was compared. School students (193 German host society members and 128 immigrants to Germany) participated in a questionnaire study. Findings revealed that both acculturation strategies of one group and relative 'fit' between immigrant and host society strategy preference were predictive of intergroup relations. In general, a strategy of integration was associated with more favourable intergroup relations in both groups, and a mismatch between host and immigrant preferred strategies yielded the most negative outcomes.

  Abstract = {The successful integration of immigrants into a host country's society, economy, and polity has become a major issue for policymakers in recent decades. Scientific progress in the study of immigrant integration has been hampered by the lack of a common measure of integration, which would allow for the accumulation of knowledge through comparison across studies, countries, and time. To address this fundamental problem, we propose the Immigration Policy Lab (IPL) Integration Index as a pragmatic and multidimensional measure of immigrant integration. The measure, both in the 12-item short form (IPL-12) and the 24-item long form (IPL-24), captures six dimensions of integration: psychological, economic, political, social, linguistic, and navigational. The measure can be used across countries, over time, and across different immigrant groups and can be administered through short questionnaires available in different modes. We report on four surveys we conducted to evaluate the empirical performance of our measure. The tests reveal that the measure distinguishes among immigrant groups with different expected levels of integration and also correlates with well-established predictors of integration.},

This is followed by the development and validation of a multidimensional measure of acculturation for Italian Canadians-one aspect of their ethnic change. Construct validation is based on confirmatory factor analyses of the multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) data. Once validated, the measure is used for an investigation of the relationships between acculturation and some aspects of gender-role perceptions of Italian-Canadian spouses.

More specifically, what and by how much must immigrants do in order to be considered a full participating member in the adopted society? The convergence and divergence of viewpoints will illuminate the perceptual gaps between native and immigrant communities. In addition, the composite score of the markers will provide a measurement of social inclusiveness; it reflects the depth of psychological barriers imposed by the individual in preserving the distinct boundaries of citizenship. Multivariate analyzes showed that the two groups reacted differently to the challenges and benefits from immigration. Surprisingly, naturalized citizens were more sensitive to the impact of perceived immigrant threats and contribution even though they imposed fewer barriers to the new arrivals in becoming a part of the mainstream society. The definition of socio-economic confidence and how it may moderate acculturation attitude will also be discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

  Abstract = {This study applies facet theory to validate Berry’s bidimensional conceptualization and measurement of acculturation attitudes and its extension by Horenczyk to include acculturation expectations. Three components of facet theory (mapping sentence, confirmatory SSA [smallest space analysis], and SSA with external variables) are proposed as valuable tools for the purpose of cross-cultural validation and theory building. In total, 526 Israeli immigrants from the former Soviet Union completed questionnaires assessing own and "perceived expected" acculturation attitudes, as well as a questionnaire measuring the strength of their cultural identities. The bidimensional "radex" configuration of acculturation attitudes confirms expected distinctions (a) between integration, separation, assimilation, and marginalization types of acculturation attitudes and (b) between similarly structured own immigrants’ attitudes and the expectations attributed to hosts. Moreover, the distinct placement of group identifications and sociodemographic characteristics as external variables in the bidimensional space corroborates the concurrent and discriminant validity of the acculturation model and measurement.},

  Abstract = {This paper summarises a research programme on the new immigrant second generation initiated in the early 1990s and completed in 2006. The four field waves of the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study (CILS) are described and the main theoretical models emerging from it are presented and graphically summarised. After considering critical views of this theory, we present the most recent results from this longitudinal research programme in the form of quantitative models predicting downward assimilation in early adulthood and qualitative interviews identifying ways for the disadvantaged children of immigrants to escape it. Quantitative results strongly support the predicted effects of exogenous variables identified by segmented assimilation theory and identify the intervening factors during adolescence that mediate their influence on adult outcomes. Qualitative evidence gathered during the last stage of the study points to three factors that can lead to exceptional educational achievement among disadvantaged youths, and which indicate the positive influence of selective acculturation. Finally, the implications of these findings for theory and policy are discussed. © 2009 Taylor \& Francis.},

  Abstract = {A world-wide internet survey was conducted to test central assumptions of a recent theory of cultural transmission in minorities proposed by the authors. 844 1st to 2nd generation immigrants from a wide variety of countries recruited on a microjob platform completed a questionnaire designed to test eight hypotheses derived from the theory. Support was obtained for all hypotheses. In particular, evidence was obtained for the continued presence, in the immigrants, of the culture-transmission motive postulated by the theory: the desire to maintain the culture of origin and transmit it to the next generation. Support was also obtained for the hypothesized anchoring of the culture-transmission motive in more basic motives fulfilled by cultural groups, the relative intra- and intergenerational stability of the culture-transmission motive, and its motivating effects for action tendencies and desires that support cultural transmission under the difficult conditions of migration. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the assumption that people have a culture-transmission motive belongs to the folk psychology of sociocultural groups, and that immigrants regard the fulfillment of this desire as a moral right.

  Abstract = {This study is part of a larger initiative toward understanding the acculturation of immigrant adolescents using the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England 2004-2010 database. A necessary step in using a database for cross-ethnic comparisons is first to verify whether its items and scales are equivalent. I examined item- and scale-level differential functioning (DF; n = 4,663, six ethnic minority groups) on four of the database’s sociocultural scales: Feelings About School (11 items), Relational Family Efficacy (four items), Being Bullied (five items), and Perceived Teacher Discrimination (four items) using an item response theory (IRT)–based framework. Findings demonstrated no meaningful DF on items and, in most cases, scales as well. Second, distinct ethnic group patterns are present. Third, the Perceived Teacher Discrimination scale was not functioning for the majority of the ethnic minority groups which is of grave concern. Implications for future comparative studies and immigration policy makers are discussed.},

  Abstract = {To investigate whether a relationship exists between acculturation and attitudes about suicide, 81 Ghanaian immigrants living in the U.S. who responded to a mail inquiry were selected to participate in the current study. This particular immigrant sample was chosen because although they represent a rapidly growing group in the U.S., they have been rarely studied. Respondents consisted of 42 women and 36 men (3 did not identify their sex), with a mean age of 29.5 yr. (SD = 10.6). Participants completed measures of acculturation and attitudes about suicide. Results indicated significant correlations between length of residency in the United States and negative suicide attitudes, and also between psychological acculturation and negative suicide attitudes. No significant relationship was found between behavioral acculturation and suicide attitudes. Furthermore, length of residency was a stronger predictor of suicide attitudes than other subjective measures of acculturation. Implications and suggestions for further research are discussed.

  Abstract = {Drinking behavior among immigrants could be influenced by drinking-related cultural norms in their country of origin and host country. This study examined the association of ethnic drinking culture, acculturation, and enculturation with alcohol drinking among male immigrants in Taiwan. This cross-sectional survey recruited 188 male immigrants. Ethnic drinking culture was divided into dry and wet according to per capita alcohol consumption and abstinent rate in the countries of origin in reference to that in Taiwan. A scale, Bidimensional Acculturation Scale for Marriage-Based Immigrants, was developed to measure acculturation (adaptation to the host culture) and enculturation (maintenance of the original culture). Drinking patterns (abstinent, low-risk drinking, and hazardous drinking) were determined by scores on the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test. There was a significant interaction between ethnic drinking culture and enculturation/acculturation on drinking patterns. Multinomial logistic regression models identified that for those from dry ethnic drinking cultures, a high level of acculturation was associated with increased low-risk drinking, while a high level of enculturation was associated with decreased low-risk drinking. For those from wet ethnic drinking cultures, a low level of acculturation and high level of enculturation were associated with increased hazardous drinking. High family socioeconomic status was associated with increased drinking, while perceived insufficient family income was positively associated with hazardous use. To prevent hazardous use of alcohol, health education should be targeted at immigrant men who drink, especially among those who have economic problems, are from wet ethnic drinking cultures, and demonstrate low adaptation to the host culture.},

  Abstract = {Urea selective catalytic reduction (urea-SCR) systems are well known for exhaust gas aftertreatment in power plant applications. Stringent specifications and the dynamic operation mode of such applications demand advanced control strategies. The control purpose of urea-SCR is to simultaneously achieve high NOx conversion efficiency and low ammonia slip. The two emission demands are contradictory. Moreover, owing to the dynamic operation mode of urea-SCR systems, advanced control strategies are required to improve urea injection control. A data-driven predictive controller for urea injection was designed. The input-output data were directly obtained from ETC driving cycle test of the diesel engine bench. The controller was derived by the coupling excitation and separation of the data. Because of the physical characteristics, the input and output constraints were considered explicitly in the problem formulation. In order to obtain offset-free control for the reference input, the predictor equation was gained with incremental inputs and outputs. The experimental test was carried out in ETC and other transient test cycle. The results showed that the controller was able to meet emission control requirements under the excitation test cycle. The closed-loop system had the ability to reject uncertainties caused by uncertainty of working conditions under the non-excitation test cycle.},
